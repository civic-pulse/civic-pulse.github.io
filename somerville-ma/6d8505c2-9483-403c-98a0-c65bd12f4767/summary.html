<li><strong>Proposal:</strong> Four-story building with 1,700 sq ft ground-floor commercial space and 10 residential units above (15,000 gross sq ft).</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Opposition/Concern:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>David Hossack (16 Wyndham Street Resident):</strong> Raised concerns about trash storage and rats, requesting binding conditions for internal trash storage (basement) and no commercial patio storage. Also requested a condition prohibiting residential parking permits for tenants. Expressed general frustration with height restriction variances, noting potential precedent for neighbors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Board Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li>Paul Miller responded to concerns:<ul>
<li>Trash: Committed to basement storage for both commercial and residential, noting the passive house design will prevent rats.</li>
<li>Accessibility: Clarified "Group 1 accessible" as adaptable units, requiring fully accessible entrances and turning space, with kitchens/bathrooms designed for future modification. "Group 2 accessible" (fully accessible from day one) is required for 5% of units in buildings with 20+ units.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Lynn Richards praised the design of the entrance and its integration with Revival Cafe's mural. Expressed concern about blank side walls and suggested commissioning a mural for one or both walls as temporary public art. Pablo Picker and Paul Miller were open to the idea.</li>
<li>Amelia Aboff commended the thoughtful and tasteful design.<ul>
<li><strong>Unit Mix:</strong> Suggested considering a Group 2 accessible unit for one of the affordable units if larger units are not feasible.</li>
<li><strong>Aesthetics:</strong> Inquired about adding a cornice line detail to cap the building, suggesting soldier course brick as an option.</li>
<li><strong>Materials:</strong> Requested a condition for materials approval, specifically for the accent color of the stair tower.</li>
<li><strong>Eversource Transformer:</strong> Expressed concern about the lack of confirmed feasibility from Eversource for the underground transformer, noting its critical impact on design. Madison Anthony confirmed that if transformer plans change, it would require a plan revision to the Board.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Michael McNeely echoed concerns about the Eversource transformer and unit mix (suggesting combining accessibility with affordability). Commended the applicant for proactively designing an all-electric building without gas, especially for a restaurant space, noting it addresses a previous policy pushback. Appreciated the trash mitigation plan.</li>
<li>Jahan Habib appreciated the restaurant consideration and inquired about alternative commercial uses if a restaurant does not pan out. Pablo Picker mentioned a yoga studio as a potential alternative.</li>
<li>Chairman Capuano reiterated the need for a residential parking sticker prohibition.</li>
<li>The Board requested the applicant return with options for defining the top of the building and a plan for a mural.</li>
</ul>
</li>
