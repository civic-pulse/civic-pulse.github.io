We have two substantive items on the agenda tonight. Hopefully we&#39;ll be able to get through those in short order. I do believe we will be going by the... order on the agenda. So first up, we have the acceptance of the minutes or approval of the minutes of our July 1st meeting. Is there any comment on those? All right. Seeing none, we&#39;ll go ahead and lay that one on the table for approval at the end of the meeting. And then let&#39;s take up items number two and three. That&#39;s 25, 1373 and 25, 1335. One is an order from Councillor Mbah that the city of Somerville hereby accepts the provisions of Chapter 53, Section 18B of the Massachusetts General Laws. And then 25-13-35 is a public communication from several former mayors and a former elected. on that item. So as we take that item up, I&#39;m gonna ask Councilor Mbah as a sponsor to go ahead and introduce this item. And then I understand you may have somebody, a member of the public you&#39;d like to sponsor speak on that. And then I know that the administration has folks in attendance to speak to the item as well. So Councilor Mbah, if I could, I&#39;ll go ahead and ask you to take that away.</td>

                <td>Thank you Chairman Scott. This You know, when I introduced this item, it was brought to me by my friend and constituent Harriet, you know, who lives in Davis Square. She was at a council meeting when I presented the item. I guess it&#39;s been getting a lot of momentum. But the main thing is this section of the state law defines a process of pre-election notification of citizens, you know, of the content. and the for and against arguments whenever any ballot question initiated by a government body will appear on election day. So the state law makes it optional for cities to put this procedure into place, even though the state itself must follow the procedure when its agencies propose ballot questions. So that is like the main rationale. At this point, I would like to, you know, sponsor former, you know, Alderman Jack Connolly, you know, who has also been following, having a keen interest on this item, speak to the item.</td>

                <td>Oh, you got us. Okay, great. Well, thank you very much. Members of the committee. Uh, and again, as I mentioned, uh, council, uh, and Bob for sponsoring the item at your last meeting. Um, As a longtime elected, as you mentioned, Mr. Chairman, I spent 33 years as both a ward and an at-large elected official. We used to be called aldermen, now city councilmen. And I&#39;m very pleased that your Charter Review Commission got around to taking a look at the city charter. It&#39;s been around since, I believe, 1899. And it was time to take a look. And after some hard work, I know A final version was drafted, came up, and both the council and the mayor endorsed it, was sent along to the statehouse. But what is missing is what a number of other communities, I believe some 49 out of 59 cities, have the process the state uses for. I think many of you are familiar with, I think you all recall the millionaire&#39;s tax in 2022. and personal recreation marijuana back in 2000. I have highlighted those in the letter that Mayors Bruhn and former Mayor Dorothy Kelly Gay introduced at your last meeting, spelling out exactly what that is. But what the new revised charter does not contain is chapter 53, section 18B of the general laws, which would require the city to send out a notice prior to the election on not just this charter, but any ballot question that should come up not only now, but in the future. And I think this is absolutely worthy of consideration because out of fairness to the elected officials who spend a lot of time talking about transparency, This charter, which a lot of people may not be familiar with until in such time they show up in November 4th, they won&#39;t have a clue as to what&#39;s contained in it unless they receive notice. And just as you see with the state, with those ballot questions, A week before the election, a section goes out sent by the Secretary of State with a summary of not just the proponent, but also the opposing point of view and a summary of the ballot question or initiative itself. So what I&#39;m asking is that on this coming Thursday night, the Honorable City Council take this up and pass this and accept Chapter 53, Section 18B, so that voters not only in November, which we&#39;ll take a look at the charter, we&#39;ll have an opportunity to review what&#39;s in it and take time should they choose to before the election. So they&#39;re simply informed on what the issue is. And this is an important one, basically sets up the order of business that the city will do going forward. And after as many years as it has been. I believe if I recall, the city charter goes back to 1899. This will be a major revision of the process and procedure of the city, and voters in the community should be made aware of it prior to the election, just as it&#39;s done at the state level. We can replicate that very easily here at the city level by accepting Chapter 53, Section 18B of the Mass General Laws. It&#39;s really as simple as that, and I know Mayors Bruhn, Mayors Kelly, and other electeds that I&#39;ve spoken to around the city, formerly electors, have all said, yeah, this is something that should happen. Let&#39;s just follow the way the state does it. It seems to work very well. I think you recall the state audit. I had a ballot question that required 75,000 signatures to audit the state legislature and reached 72% favorability. That&#39;s something to be done at the state level. I think our requirement here would be a lot less based on the number of voters we have. But the key point here is to adopt this section of the state law that will allow the city to notify the voters on not just this charter issue this November, but any issue going forward in the future.</td>

                <td> Through the chair, thank you for the opportunity. I just wanted to share our position on this item. The administration is happy to continue having discussions on the adoption of this mass gender law. However, at this time, based on internal conversations that we&#39;ve had, it is our opinion that adoption and implementation is not feasible for this year&#39;s election cycle. The election commissioner, as you mentioned, is here along with his team to outline the timelines and deadlines that are prescribed in the statute and explain to the committee why meeting those requirements would be difficult for this year&#39;s election, particularly in connection with coordinating early voting and mailing of any potential guide. They will also outline any related budgetary and administrative impacts on the department if this were to be implemented. And then law department is here, of course, to answer any questions, but also to speak to the logistical concerns and neutrality concerns around adopting this mass gender law. um specifically around the selection uh proponents and opponents uh of any ballot question um as a responsibility for that falls on the city solicitor under the statute and then lastly i just wanted to mention that i understand uh based on the comments here tonight and um comments at the last council meeting that one of the motivations behind this proposal is making sure that voters have all necessary information around the charter ballot question. I just wanted to say that the administration is aligned with that goal and we also believe that providing information to the voters around the charter ballot question is important and necessary. I do want to say that we don&#39;t necessarily need to opt into this general law in order to move forward with a voter information plan. We&#39;ll of course have to work with our law department and our communications department to make sure that any outreach to the voters will be in compliance with OCPF guidelines specifically around the use of public funds for distributing information related to ballot questions. But we can internally figure out a plan and share appropriate education materials either on our website or at appropriate city hall meetings and other official events. So with that, I&#39;ll hand it over to Commissioner Salerno to talk about some of the deadlines and other concerns.</td>

That is not something that we can commit to right now. And also we have other concerns. What we can commit to is coming up with a plan to educate the members of the public around what is on the ballot with regard to the charter bill. It could mean putting neutral information on our website like we did with the CPA ballot question. We can come up with a plan to educate folks on the ballot question that would be a feasible and also legal under state law. But right now, we don&#39;t think that it&#39;s logistically feasible for us to mail each household a guide similar to that. the state secretary&#39;s office does.</td>

And we normally get out a mail out early ballots as early as a month prior to an election, which would put it at October 4th. And in the meantime, the law department has got to do some follow-up. Once the state Senate says where they are, the law department has to do some follow-up work. And that&#39;s going to take about a week to 10 days for them to get the information out that they need and get responses back. So at this point, I think it would be good if Ms. Arruda would explain it a little bit more thoroughly based on her findings for us.</td>

                <td>Thank you. So the issues that we&#39;re somewhat facing is that a lot of the laws, the election laws, haven&#39;t quite caught up with mail-in voting. So mail-in voting is somewhat new. It&#39;s about five years old, but a lot of the other election laws haven&#39;t changed yet. So when it comes to these timelines, like the commissioner was saying, the deadlines to even come up with these questions kind of run into the time where you would already mail a ballot. So just the challenge that we&#39;re facing with this, just the questions regarding the charter is that if the charter is not approved through the state house until the 30th, that&#39;s also the date that the questions text, like exactly what&#39;s gonna be on the ballot about the charter is also due to our office. So that&#39;s a little... That&#39;s a time constraint there where if anything gets changed in the charter by the 30th, we also have to have our final text for the question alone on the 30th. So it&#39;s the same exact day. In a typical election, local election year, we would order our ballots right when the recount timeline ends, which for this election would be September 22nd. But in this year&#39;s case, we have this charter question, which may not be approved until the 30th of September. And then we also have another question that was presented by constituents that has a challenge period of the beginning of October. So we&#39;re already ordering our ballots way later than we would typically order them in a regular election, local election year. As for getting the text for the summaries of the yes and the nose like if this 15 be was passed. We would have to the law department would have to reach out to the proponents and the opponents of all the three questions that are being presented to be put onto our ballot um. So I know that the law department can speak a little bit more on the deadlines of coming up with the text for the summaries of the questions that would go into the mailing. And as of now, we know that there&#39;s probably about 33,000 households in the city that we would have to do a mailing to. So that would be, I guess, the budget constraint is seeing how much a mailing would be because we&#39;d have to include the three questions, summaries, and text that are gonna be proposed to be on the ballot. if this is accepted, and we would have to mail it to the 33,000 households. So I don&#39;t know if I have any other information I can give, but if anyone has questions.</td>

I never heard of that before, but those are the communities that apparently have it from that perspective. So there is a little bit of a inconsistency there, but as a practical matter, it looks like at least as of 2015, there were roughly eight to 10. So Ms. Singh has that right in the ballpark for what it seems to be for the communities. If there&#39;s something that I don&#39;t have, I&#39;d be happy to look at it, but that&#39;s the best information I have. And I&#39;ve also connected with the Brookline and Cambridge on their experience with it too, from a practical perspective.</td>

                <td>Sure. The crux of it is from the point of view of Cambridge, they also agree that there are timeline type issues in terms of trying to coordinate the sending of the guide with the early voting issue. And there may be situations where as a practical matter, someone gets their early voting ballot and then fills it out. And then a few days later in the mail, they get the guide. because we have to give seven days notice to the proponent and the opponents. So that&#39;s sort of a practical thing we&#39;re trying to struggle with. The other part of it is that there is a, at least what I&#39;m gonna call an optical bias of neutrality with the city solicitor, but I&#39;m sure that comes with the territory. If you have a particularly controversial ballot question, John Lund, City of Boulder, The city solicitor is charged with coming up with a neutral presentation of the summary and what can happen is that nobody&#39;s happy, but that is not insurmountable but just flagging that as an issue that they&#39;ve run into and other communities. who I&#39;ve talked to. So those are the two, I think, high-level challenges that I&#39;m highlighting that I&#39;ve heard from just two other communities that I&#39;ve talked to. I&#39;ve not talked to everybody else, but that&#39;s what I had just to kind of get the ball rolling on it.</td>

So they already have had a mailing prepared and they already have it printed to send out the beginning of September to their voters. So I think it&#39;s just that September 30th deadline that&#39;s really important. cutting into the early voting. I think if we had had it beforehand, it wouldn&#39;t really affect early voting as much as if we could get it out right after the preliminary election. Because the other thing also like solicitor said was with early voting, once you turn your ballot in, there&#39;s no going back. So before with absentee voting, if you voted absentee and then you could get to the polls, you could cast your ballot out. if your ballot hadn&#39;t already made it into the machine, you could cast another ballot. With early voting, once we have it turned in, we can&#39;t issue another ballot. So it&#39;s almost like if you voted and then you kind of got the guide and understood the questions a little bit more, you can&#39;t recast your ballot with the new early voting laws that are in place currently.</td>

And the rule is that if distribution of information is not undertaken consistent with that statute, it is that governmental resources may not be used to distribute voter information commenting on the substance of a ballot question. So the general rule is that You must accept the statute in order to make it happen as indicated for a mailing, for example, to everybody. There are things we can do, which I&#39;m reviewing with staff, things you can do without running afoul of the campaign finance statute. For example, as Singh indicated, you can have things on the governmental website, just for example. or distribute items at the meetings, at city meetings, for example. There&#39;s a list of things you can do, a list of things you can&#39;t do. And one thing they don&#39;t allow is sending out a mass mailing unless the statute&#39;s accepted.</td>

                <td>Thank you, Counselor Scott. I just want to echo everything that David and Mr. Solano have said and can&#39;t emphasize enough that it&#39;s the lead time to get it right. That&#39;s problematic. And with three ballot questions, that&#39;s really the issue in most cities and towns that have done it. They&#39;ve made appropriations. They&#39;ve known this was coming. It&#39;s been on their books already. And as David alluded to, although we cannot do mass mailings, We can put information in flyers. We can have things on the website. They can be distributed meetings and other areas, perhaps. We just cannot mail everyone anything. And then you also run into the fact that you&#39;ll be in a situation where some people will get the information, others will not because of the early voting. So And there&#39;s three different questions, right? So we have to do the research for the pros and cons of everything. And with all due respect, the hardest one to find pros and cons for seem to be the charter questions, you know, because it was a collaborative effort. So we would have to really look hard for the reasons opposing the charter change to get it right. So our concern is that it&#39;s important to get the information out there, but it&#39;s more important to get the information out there accurately, correctly, and so people can rely upon it. And so It&#39;s unusual to put this adoption of the statute right on the heels of an election, particularly because we don&#39;t even know if two of the questions are going to even be on the ballot at this point in time.</td>

I understand that it sounds like we&#39;re a little late to the game for this election. with this critical issue on the ballot, was there a decision made not to adopt this chapter previously when we could have, like some of our neighboring communities have done, sort of anticipate and be prepared?</td>

You know, fortunately, we have, I think, an administration and a council who have been very amenable to mid-year appropriations and certainly an item for as little as $40,000 we&#39;ve seen handled by interdepartmental transfers very simply for other reasons. So I&#39;m less concerned about it, but I understand the argument. I&#39;m going to go to Citizen Connolly briefly and then hopefully have some deliberation here amongst committee members, and then we can figure out how to proceed on this. Yes.</td>

                <td>Thank you, ma&#39;am. Yeah, I just I&#39;m a little confused because all I&#39;ve heard so far is that it&#39;s not logistically feasible. There&#39;s budget issues, the timing for this election, $40,000 cost. If I recall, isn&#39;t the city budget somewhere around $380 million for this coming year? I&#39;m a little confused like you are, Mr. Chairman, about the cost of this, but if I recall, I believe the Charter Review Commission sent this to the Statehouse back in May, and it just seems incomprehensible to me that these items weren&#39;t in consideration, knowing that there was an election coming up with a matter of months after the adoption and sending this to the State House. I would think and I understand there was this matter was reviewed by the Charter Review Commission for if not a couple of three years and this never came up and I will and I&#39;ve sent it to Councilor Mbah that I have on research with some of my friends and colleagues that their city charters with these initiative and referendum positions under Chapter 53, Section 18B have been adopted by cities and towns. Once it&#39;s adopted by the city town, yes, there are procedural matters like timelines and everything else that Nick has mentioned and the solicitor has mentioned. Had that been adopted by the Charter Review Commission and sent along, we wouldn&#39;t be having this discussion right now. What are we afraid of in the city charter that the voters shouldn&#39;t know about If this is the first time in 126 years that the chart has been revised, why aren&#39;t we shouting from the rooftops about what a great thing this is and why wasn&#39;t that thought of during the course of this whole review? I&#39;m somewhat in a quandary as to what&#39;s the big hurry for this if it&#39;s taken this long, if it&#39;s got to take a little longer. Even if it does mean spending a few extra dollars to do this, why not spend the $40,000? Okay, you got to work a little bit harder over the next few months to make sure that this happens. But the voters deserve the right to be informed about a substantive change as drastic as this. And I think that&#39;s an issue. To me, this is a real travesty of transparency. And I and others are not going to be happy. If you try and move this forward without taking a very solid and hard look at what&#39;s involved, there&#39;s nothing difficult about adopting this Chapter 53, Section 18B. Implementation, sure, you&#39;ve got to do some work, but anything worthwhile always involves doing some work. And both the city attorney and Mr. Shapiro, the assistant solicitor, mentioned there&#39;s a specific procedure for it. I&#39;m sorry, putting it on the website and doing a mailer from the city isn&#39;t going to work. You&#39;ve got to do it the way it&#39;s spelled out in the Mass General Laws, just as the ballot question for the million dollar tax for the recreational marijuana question. All items were done with initiative petitions. It certainly could happen here, whether it&#39;s the city or a bunch of citizens who want to put something on the ballot. There&#39;s a process, procedures, signatures to be gathered. If it&#39;s worthwhile, it should be taken the time and it should be set up, whether it&#39;s for this charter or for any initiative in the future as we move on. This charter has been around for 126 years. We need to take a little more time. amended, now&#39;s the time to do it.</td>

So going to colleagues, I appreciate that perspective, Citizen Connolly, and I appreciate you taking the time to be with us this evening. So for colleagues, we have now the will of the committee to consider. This is the adoption of Section IMGL. As we maybe heard, we&#39;re not exactly sure how many cities and towns have done this, but certainly some some number of them that is above eight have done so and so the question is whether or not we would like to adopt this as council davis said there is also a question of adopting it with an effective date that is after this election so that it would be in effect for future elections but would not affect these questions uh i have to say i myself am also uh this would seem to be business that would be reasonably anticipated to be before the city. So, uh, being prepared to publish information about this, I don&#39;t think would be a reach. I don&#39;t think $40,000 is particularly high reach for this, uh, somewhere, uh, less than one, one hundredth of 1% of the city&#39;s budget. Uh, and given the amount of free cash we&#39;ve rolled with in previous years and the still open vacancies, I&#39;m sure there&#39;s plenty of lag money to cover this particular expense in this, uh, in this case. That said, it is the will of the committee, so I&#39;d love to hear from my colleagues about your inclinations here, and then it&#39;ll be open for motions on how to handle the item. I will say at the outset, I&#39;m inclined to favor adoption of this, but eager to hear the discussion. Councilor Ewen-Campen, followed by Councilor Imbach. Councilor Ewen-Campen, you have the floor.</td>

I think we could have done this a year and a half ago, basically. We wouldn&#39;t be in this situation. That said, this is the situation we&#39;re in. I am compelled by the arguments that the Elections Department, the city solicitor, makes on the timeline. If it was purely a matter of cost, this would not be a hard question for me. But as it pertains to getting the pro and anti statements together in time for early voting, given the deadlines, that seems real to me. So... You know, I was obviously unaware that this state law existed to be opt into until Councillor Mbah put this forward. So to me, it&#39;s commonsensical for us to do something like that. We&#39;re going to ask ballot questions, you know, as the state does. People should be aware of them before they get to the ballot booth. Otherwise, it kind of makes, why are we asking people to vote on these things that they have no prior information on? That said, I just think, you know, as it pertains specifically to this one, I don&#39;t see how it&#39;s going to work this year. So my inclination would be to not, you know, rush an ugly mishap for this election, but instead to, you know, keep working on this. I think it makes sense to adopt this in the future so that we&#39;re not in this situation again. But I don&#39;t I wouldn&#39;t personally support it for this election, given what we&#39;ve heard tonight.</td>

                <td>Thank you, Mr. Chair. So I&#39;m also frustrated, but I think the frustration lies in that somehow this didn&#39;t come up any sooner, and I certainly could have dug it up. Here we are, as the good Councilor from Ward 3 said, I&#39;m also not inclined to sort of push us into a situation where we may then instantly be in violation of state law. But I I agree that the money aspect doesn&#39;t strike me as a significant challenge. The logistics, I hear that argument. So I guess what I&#39;d like to understand a little more clearly and perhaps with more of a definitive commitment is what... what is the administration going to do to make sure that this information is available um you know we&#39;ve heard we could put information on the website we could hand out flyers like those were hypothetical i heard those presented as hypotheticals so you know i&#39;d like to understand I suspect there is a more concrete plan than that. Just my hunch, knowing the folks involved. So what is the plan? Walk us through what we&#39;re going to do to try and accomplish the intent of this information, what this ordinance would do without running afoul of the rules that say we either have to follow it to the T or not mail anything.</td>

So in anticipation of that, we&#39;ve started working on, of course, not only the text of the ballot question, but also a summary, one pager. We&#39;ll have to work with our comms department and our law department to figure out what are appropriate ways for us to put that information out there so we&#39;re not violating state law. I can, however, I do want to say that while we can make sure that we&#39;re ready to press send, the question, the home rule petition is still pending at the state house. Just today I received edits from and feedback from the senate committee where this is pending. So we can&#39;t reach out to opponents or proponents in anticipation. We can get materials ready, but we can&#39;t hit send before we know exactly the language that will be before the voters. So to answer your question, we&#39;ve started working on the materials and we hope to come up with a concrete plan and share that with the council soon.</td>

                <td> All right, Councilor Davis. So I appreciate the desire to do our best. However, I do think this is a situation where there is a structure that&#39;s in place there for getting information out to voters. It&#39;s not just about the four-year mayoral term and the charter. There is also another ballot question that is out there that there&#39;s a great degree of interest in and I think folks have an expectation that there&#39;s going to be information published on this. Cities and towns find ways to do this. I understand the time crunch here is particularly tight, especially since we are waiting on the State House. And the State House has, from what I heard, until September 30th to approve it in a timeline that would allow it to be on the ballot for our municipal general. That said, I&#39;m also... I share the opinion of my colleague up in Ward 3 about not wanting to rush an ugly mishap, I believe was the phrasing for this election. I think if we&#39;re operating on timelines that are so tight that it leaves us in doubt as to our ability to comply with state law and requirements of informing our residents about the content of ballot questions, and it&#39;s been 125 years since this charter was changed, I&#39;d be more inclined to ensure that we have it on an election where we do have the time to satisfy those requirements. As much as I know everybody would like this charter to have been put to bed two years ago, and as much as I spent years of my life as the chair of that charter review committee, I would be dismayed to see it placed before the electorate here in a willy-nilly fashion. And I&#39;d be more inclined to wait until our next municipal election to put that. That&#39;s it. I think I&#39;ve seen our city do incredible things to make incredible efforts to do the right thing when it&#39;s in a situation where it&#39;s clear. I&#39;m not sure how this would be recommended out of committee tonight. What I would love to do, since we are coming up on the hour, I know that President Davis has to go attend the school committee meeting, so I would like to at least draw our conversation this evening to a conclusion, whether that is to have a vote, whether or not to recommend approval of this, or simply to discharge it, because what I am not inclined to do is to leave the matter in committee. for an extended period of time without having our colleagues at the council at large be able to express their will either in the context of a vote to recommend for or against approval of this or adopting the statute or even simply taking a vote to refer it back to committee with the understanding that it would not be adopted in time for this election. So I would like to have us come, if not to consensus, at least to some motion and vote on it this evening in the next few minutes. As I said, nothing I&#39;ve heard so far has dissuaded me from the wisdom of actually adopting the statute. And I have confidence in our team&#39;s ability to make something happen here. So with that said, Councilor Mbah, another bite at the apple, go for it.</td>

I do believe it is possible, but I wanna reserve the ability to go back and triple check unless David can confirm for me that you could adopt the statute with an implementation date in the future, right? would be the easy thing to do. I believe there is ultimately some language in the charter and perhaps Neha can correct me if I&#39;m wrong, that does speak to having it on this ballot or when we can get it on the ballot and comply with state requirements because we sort of anticipated, but I don&#39;t know that we, I know we were not anticipating a voluntary election of a state statute that no one had mentioned. So I don&#39;t know and I haven&#39;t looked into whether that provision would be broad enough to allow us to delay the charter. I also am not sure if there is any time left and I&#39;m completely throwing out ideas that I need to at least confirm, but these are the things I can potentially think may possibly be within the realm of reality. I&#39;m not saying they are, but what I can, I don&#39;t know if a petition, if there&#39;s time for a petition, yet another ballot question to delay, implementation. I don&#39;t know the answer to any of those. None of this was anticipated. The only thing that was anticipated was that we may not have a charter in time to comply with the election requirements. and we didn&#39;t want the charter implementation to be negated if we couldn&#39;t comply with the state requirements on elections. So we do have some language in there allowing us, if we can&#39;t comply with state election requirements, that as soon as we can, which would be in whatever next election, we wouldn&#39;t have to go through this whole process again. I don&#39;t know if it would be broad enough to cover the scenario you all are just now thinking about. and sharing with us, but we could look further into it and I&#39;ll defer to David and Neha if they have anything further to add.</td>

So, you know, if folks here want to express their current thinking about it, so that colleagues will have that in the minutes and available on a video review. I know there&#39;s a few people who expressed to me they want to tune into this discussion after they got done with the rent control rep. So as I said, I&#39;m happy to communicate mine, which is that I&#39;m inclined to support passages of this because I believe it&#39;s an established structure for getting information out to voters. I can&#39;t think of too many justifications that that rise to the level of saying, no, we don&#39;t need to do that this time. So that&#39;s my take on it, but I am inclined to move to recommend this, move to discharge this without a recommendation. On that motion, is there any discussion or other expression of current intent or position from other members of the committee? all right no discussion on that motion so on that motion to discharge uh without recommendation uh this would be on item uh two three one three or two five one three seven three uh why don&#39;t we go ahead and take a quick roll call on that one since uh counselor davis i believe has to leave us shortly on the motion counselor davis yes</td>

Now we&#39;re at item four, that&#39;s 251317, Licensing Commission Requesting Acceptance of Mass General Laws, Chapter 138, Section 12D, to allow current wine and malt beverage license holders to apply to convert to a non-transferable all-forms alcohol license. I did receive an email one hour before the start of this meeting from our legislative... intergovernmental office staff from the mayor&#39;s office, and that has been attached to this agenda as a PDF. I&#39;ll go ahead and pull that up and share that on screen. Here we go. I believe that is the right window. Let&#39;s see if I got it right. So this is a letter from our clerk, Kim Wells, just to introduce the item. This is based on a recommendation from the city clerk and a vote of the licensing commission, which recommended adoption of this. But for the details, Madam Clerk, would you like to introduce this? Oh, or Mr. Patera, all right. Our licensing commission.</td>

This is an item that the state legislature has made available for cities and towns to opt into. And as the city clerk&#39;s office is the administrator of the licensing commission, much like we are for the city council, we started with this as a discussion among that body and they were unanimously supportive of making this opportunity available to our licensees. And so this memo before you outlines some of the details of that. I will leave it to our licensing operations manager to answer any further questions if the committee does have them.</td>

And just for folks in public who may not realize that there&#39;s two different kinds of liquor licenses. One can serve beer and wine and one can serve cocktails and everything else. There have been a lot of iterations over the course of Massachusetts history, and it is a fascinating one when you get into the aftermarket on liquor licenses and some of the other problems and ills that have come out of that system over time. It&#39;s been expanded and cleaned up over the years. To my eye, this seems like a pretty straightforward exercise here that simplifies and increases access, but I&#39;m happy to hear any questions from colleagues for our licensing operation manager and any deliberation for hopefully moving to a quick motion here. So Councilor Young-Camp and you have the floor.</td>

                <td> so um if you will let our licensing operations manager take it away one more time i think that could be valuable information yeah let&#39;s get after it happy to do so mr chair through you the way that licenses work for alcohol service in the city they&#39;re allocated by the state and originally they were allocated in one big bulk package called quota licenses that were based on just on population In 2012, the city petitioned and successfully received from the state legislature additional licenses that were exclusively for the use in the newly developed, at the time, Assembly Square area. Since then, in 2016, Somerville requested additional licenses for two specific areas within the city. one area is called enhancement um it is as it sounds these is this is a area where there already are licenses for restaurants and bars and things like that um they gave us some additional licenses for that area and another called transformative and that&#39;s for an area where there really isn&#39;t quite as much of a restaurant um seen to encourage uh development in that area so for any of those licenses that were issued by the state under the wine and malt limitation, adopting this law would allow those folks to convert to all forms. There is a cap to these licenses. A useful way to think of it is there&#39;s a bucket for all forms and a bucket for wine and malt. If this is adopted, if someone in the wine and malt bucket would like to convert to an all forms, it still stays in the wine and malt bucket. So it doesn&#39;t actually impact the number of all forms licenses we have. Does that make sense?</td>
