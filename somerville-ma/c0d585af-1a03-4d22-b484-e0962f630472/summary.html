<h3 id="4-order-by-councilor-sait-director-of-mobility-update-on-speed-limit-signage-and-no-motorized-vehicle-signage-along-the-community-path-and-at-its-entrances">4. Order by Councilor Sait: Director of Mobility Update on Speed Limit Signage and No Motorized Vehicle Signage Along the Community Path and at its Entrances</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li>Director of Mobility, Brad Ross, provided an update on community engagement efforts for the Community Path, including tabling outreach and surveys.</li>
<li>Ross acknowledged concerns about motorized vehicles and e-bikes operating at excessive speeds, creating an unsafe environment for seniors and parents with strollers.</li>
<li>Signage development, design, funding, and installation are anticipated to be part of the community process, with the earliest installation expected in Spring 2026 due to the rapid end of the current construction season.</li>
<li>Councilor Sait expressed frustration regarding the lack of signage and overall rules, noting the unsafe environment. She plans to submit a separate item regarding speed limits, as much of it is outside Somerville's control.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Outcome:</strong> Item kept in committee for future updates, particularly concerning speed limits.</li>

<h3 id="5-order-by-councilors-clingan-mclaughlin-wilson-and-strezo-director-of-mobility-and-director-of-engineering-to-install-crosswalks-across-walnut-street-and-wigglesworth-street-near-sunnyside-avenue-to-protect-winter-hill-community-innovation-school-students-families-and-educators-using-the-otis-street-footbridge">5. Order by Councilors Clingan, McLaughlin, Wilson, and Strezo: Director of Mobility and Director of Engineering to Install Crosswalks Across Walnut Street and Wigglesworth Street Near Sunnyside Avenue to Protect Winter Hill Community Innovation School Students, Families, and Educators Using the Otis Street Footbridge</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Public Comment:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Samantha Zielsdorf</strong>, a parent of two Winter Hill School students residing on Sunnyside Avenue, highlighted the danger posed by fast-moving traffic on Walnut Street and Wigglesworth Street, where many children cross daily without crosswalks. She requested crosswalks and traffic calming measures.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li>Director of Engineering, Brian Postowait, acknowledged the issue, noting that the Engineering Division, with Mobility's support, refreshed crosswalks in the neighborhood 18-24 months prior, following the Winter Hill School's move to the Edgerly site.</li>
<li>Postowait stated that a Walnut Street crosswalk is more warranted due to higher traffic volume and distance from existing crosswalks (700 feet between Bonaire and Pearl). Wigglesworth Street is a quieter local street, making the argument for a crosswalk there less urgent.</li>
<li>He emphasized the challenge of prioritizing this request among many similar requests from other school neighborhoods (e.g., West Somerville Neighborhood School, Kennedy, Argenziano, Healy).</li>
<li>Postowait indicated that this project would be "put in the hopper" for review and has a higher chance of being prioritized sooner due to the ongoing West Pearl project, allowing for more efficient contractor utilization.</li>
<li>Councilor Wilson stressed that the Winter Hill School's temporary relocation to Edgerly is for six years, making these crosswalks a long-term necessity, not a temporary fix. He likened the lack of crosswalks to the "weakest link" in a commute, impacting perceived safety.</li>
<li>Councilor Sait reiterated the importance of prioritizing safety measures near schools, including crosswalks and speed humps, and offered to explore funding solutions if needed.</li>
<li>Director Ross reminded the committee of the technical challenges in siting new crosswalks, including the need for accessible curb ramps and impediments like utility poles, hydrants, and driveways. He cited the Lowell Street project as an example.</li>
<li>Postowait confirmed preliminary checks revealed trees and poles but not significant drainage infrastructure issues. He noted that exact placement might vary from intersections to accommodate accessibility requirements.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Outcome:</strong> Item marked as completed.</li>

<h3 id="6-order-by-councilors-ewen-campen-wilson-strezo-clingan-and-ball-director-of-engineering-update-on-efforts-to-fix-the-unsafe-crossing-of-the-community-path-at-school-street">6. Order by Councilors Ewen-Campen, Wilson, Strezo, Clingan, and Ball: Director of Engineering Update on Efforts to Fix the Unsafe Crossing of the Community Path at School Street</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Public Comment:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Ben Orenstein</strong>, a resident of 5 Maxwell's Green, described the unsafe 90-degree turn at the Community Path's School Street crossing, exacerbated by fencing and screening. He personally installed a convex mirror to improve visibility and noted strong community concern.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li>Director Postowait acknowledged the long-standing issue, dating back to 2020 during GLX design reviews. He attributed the difficulty in resolution to the intersection of two high-profile projects (high school and GLX) and multiple jurisdictions (City, MBTA, MassDOT).</li>
<li>A consultant was hired to design changes to the bridge structure, as no improvements are possible without altering the bridge or acquiring adjacent properties.</li>
<li>The design process is approximately one-third complete, with public sharing anticipated in October.</li>
<li>Postowait confirmed that updates on the Lowell Street crossing, which is linked to this project due to similar constructability and regulatory requirements, would also be included.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Outcome:</strong> Item kept in committee, with an update anticipated in October/early November.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="7-order-by-councilor-sait-director-of-parking-to-install-a-new-magoon-square-municipal-parking-lot-sign-at-the-magoon-square-municipal-lot">7. Order by Councilor Sait: Director of Parking to Install a New Magoon Square Municipal Parking Lot Sign at the Magoon Square Municipal Lot</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li>Councilor Sait explained that businesses in Magoon Square requested clearer signage for the municipal parking lot, as customers are often unaware of its availability.</li>
<li>Director of Parking, Suzanne Renfrew, expressed confusion, noting existing "public parking lot" and "pay to park" signs, as well as a "Welcome to Magoon Square" sign. She requested more specific guidance on the desired sign wording.</li>
<li>Councilor Sait clarified the need for a sign explicitly stating "Magoon Square Municipal Parking Lot" or "Magoon Square Parking Lot" to combine the public parking and location information. She offered to connect Renfrew with the businesses for further input.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Outcome:</strong> Item marked as completed.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="8-order-by-councilors-sait-and-wilson-director-of-mobility-to-return-do-not-block-intersection-signage-to-the-intersection-of-broadway-and-hinkley-street">8. Order by Councilors Sait and Wilson: Director of Mobility to Return "Do Not Block Intersection" Signage to the Intersection of Broadway and Hinkley Street</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li>Councilor Sait noted that the sign was removed during construction years ago, and Hinkley neighbors requested its return due to confusion.</li>
<li>Director Postowait stated that the exact removal date is unclear but likely occurred during construction.</li>
<li>He explained that the city's current policy for "Do Not Block" signs prioritizes locations impacting fire department emergency response or preventing gridlock at signalized intersections.</li>
<li>The Broadway and Hinkley Street intersection does not meet these criteria, as it does not significantly impact emergency response or cause gridlock.</li>
<li>Postowait emphasized avoiding overuse of such signs to maintain their effectiveness.</li>
<li>Councilor Sait inquired if this area would be addressed in upcoming street reconstruction plans for Broadway. Postowait confirmed that the Broadway redesign project, actively being worked on by Mobility and Engineering, would be an appropriate venue to consider solutions for this intersection.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Outcome:</strong> Item marked as completed.</li>

<h3 id="9-order-by-councilor-mclaughlin-director-of-mobility-to-place-a-speed-bump-on-pinckney-street-and-consider-the-neighbor-way-potential-of-this-street">9. Order by Councilor McLaughlin: Director of Mobility to Place a Speed Bump on Pinckney Street and Consider the Neighbor Way Potential of this Street</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li>Director Ross confirmed that Pinckney Street has been added to the list of candidate streets for traffic calming, acknowledging the long list of requests.</li>
<li>Regarding "Neighbor Ways" treatments, Ross noted that Pinckney Street is not included in the official citywide bicycle network plan (2030 and 2040 milestones), though Florence Street, one block over, is.</li>
<li>He stated that while Pinckney Street is not a priority for Neighbor Ways, the department is open to discussion with the ward councilor and community members when considering the neighborhood holistically.</li>
<li>Ross committed to reviewing Pinckney Street for traffic calming potential and communicating the timeline (1-4 years) due to the high demand.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Outcome:</strong> Item marked as completed.</li>

<h3 id="10-order-by-councilors-mclaughlin-clingan-wilson-and-davis-director-of-mobility-update-on-recent-changes-to-the-mbta-bus-route-90-and-the-reasons-for-those-changes">10. Order by Councilors McLaughlin, Clingan, Wilson, and Davis: Director of Mobility Update on Recent Changes to the MBTA Bus Route 90 and the Reasons for Those Changes</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li>Director Ross provided a detailed summary of the MBTA Route 90 changes.</li>
<li><strong>Background:</strong> In 2022, the MBTA Board approved a bus network redesign. Initially, Route 90 changes did not include eliminating the East Somerville leg (Pearl, Cross, Broadway). After the Green Line Extension (GLX) opened, MBTA staff focused on connecting bus service to GLX stations, particularly the East Somerville Station at Washington and Joy.</li>
<li><strong>Service Change:</strong> MBTA initiated a service change, rerouting the 90 bus down McGrath to Washington Street, bypassing the heart of East Somerville. City staff and residents were not adequately consulted, and the change negatively impacted high school students and environmental justice populations.</li>
<li><strong>Advocacy and Restoration:</strong> Mayor Ballantyne, city staff, and community members engaged in a letter-writing campaign and diplomatic advocacy with MBTA General Manager Phil Eng.</li>
<li><strong>Resolution:</strong> In June, a site walk with MBTA officials led to an agreement: if the city made safety improvements for bus operators (e.g., turning space at Cross and Broadway), the MBTA would restore the service.</li>
<li><strong>Current Status:</strong> As of the end of August, Route 90 bus service has been restored to Pearl Street, Cross Street, and Broadway.</li>
<li><strong>Future Considerations:</strong> Ross cautioned that MBTA's original rationale (combining 88/90 for frequency, GLX connections) remains valid. Further public consultation is needed to find long-term solutions that balance these goals with community needs, especially for north-south connectivity.</li>
<li>Councilor Sait expressed gratitude for the restoration of the "essential route," highlighting its importance for high school students and residents without cars.</li>
<li>Councilor Burnley inquired about the implications of the restoration on Cross Street, specifically regarding parking removal.</li>
<li>Ross explained that MBTA safety and operations teams cited frequent issues on the exceptionally narrow Cross Street (side swipes, delays, gridlock). Restricting parking near the signalized intersection at Cross and Broadway, and addressing short bus stops, was deemed essential by the MBTA to ensure operator and rider safety and efficient service.</li>
<li>Councilor Burnley requested that the department provide data on crashes or side-swipes to the public during future discussions, acknowledging community concerns about parking in residential areas.</li>
<li>Ross acknowledged the feedback and committed to improving communication processes regarding street changes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Outcome:</strong> Item marked as completed.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="11-order-by-councilor-clingan-director-of-mobility-to-install-stop-signs-on-10-hills-road-and-governor-winthrop-road-making-the-intersection-a-four-way-stop">11. Order by Councilor Clingan: Director of Mobility to Install Stop Signs on 10 Hills Road and Governor Winthrop Road, Making the Intersection a Four-Way Stop</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li>Director Ross explained that installing stop signs is complex and requires adherence to federal standards and guidelines, including specific analyses and warrants to avoid liability.</li>
<li>He stated that due diligence for this location has not yet begun.</li>
<li>Ross indicated that Mobility and Engineering teams would reach out to Councilor Clingan to understand the specific problem (e.g., cut-through traffic, speeds, compliance records) before providing a thoughtful response.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Outcome:</strong> Item marked as completed.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="12-order-by-councilor-sait-director-of-mobility-to-update-the-traffic-signal-equipment-at-the-intersection-of-rogers-ave-and-boston-ave">12. Order by Councilor Sait: Director of Mobility to Update the Traffic Signal Equipment at the Intersection of Rogers Ave and Boston Ave</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li>Councilor Sait noted this item was placed to ensure the issue remains on the department's radar.</li>
<li>Director Postowait explained that a comprehensive analysis of this intersection is complex due to its impact on the adjacent Willow Street intersection.</li>
<li>The current signal cabinets pose a challenge for substantive changes.</li>
<li>Postowait stated that the best approach is to couple this upgrade with a larger construction project, specifically the planned reconstruction of Broadway from Ball Square to the Powder House Rotary, which is in the five-year plan.</li>
<li>He acknowledged that this is not an immediate solution but is the most effective long-term strategy.</li>
<li>Councilor Sait expressed disappointment that a temporary solution isn't feasible but accepted the explanation, emphasizing the importance of the project and the need to avoid delays.</li>
<li>Postowait indicated that the exact year for this project within the five-year plan is uncertain, pending a new street plan to be issued in the new calendar year.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Outcome:</strong> Item marked as completed.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="13-order-by-councilor-mclaughlin-director-of-mobility-to-install-a-rapid-flashing-beacon-with-push-button-stop-sign-in-front-of-the-east-somerville-community-school-on-the-cross-street-side-to-assist-in-street-crossings">13. Order by Councilor McLaughlin: Director of Mobility to Install a Rapid Flashing Beacon with Push Button Stop Sign in Front of the East Somerville Community School on the Cross Street Side to Assist in Street Crossings</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li>Director Ross explained that the city is currently prioritizing and establishing criteria for the use of rapid flashing beacons (rectangular yellow flashing signs activated by pedestrians).</li>
<li>He noted that these are typically used on multi-lane crossings with higher speeds (e.g., East Broadway near the library) and less commonly on narrow streets like Cross Street.</li>
<li>Ross suggested that physical traffic calming, such as the raised crosswalk at Cross and Everett, is often more effective in slowing motorists and improving visibility.</li>
<li>He committed to working with Councilor McLaughlin and constituents to evaluate the location and determine if different signage is warranted, without making promises before a technical review.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Outcome:</strong> Item marked as completed.</li>
