                <td>Good evening, Chair. Good evening, committee. Brad Ross and I serve as director of mobility. And it seems like our motion sensor lights are going to do this all night. I apologize. Chair, as you know, city staff have recently launched a community engagement process focused on a variety of short, medium, and long-term safety upgrades for the community path. Not just the community path extension that was built along with the Green Line extension, but the entire path. Just this past Saturday, Chair, I want to give a tip of the cap to staff from Mobility Division who are out doing tabling outreach on the path. They&#39;ve been doing it nights, weekends, trying to really diversify and maximize the number of people that we&#39;re able to speak with to hear what&#39;s going well and what can be improved. We have definitely heard the same things that you have heard as board counselor about motorized vehicles disproportionately using the path often in aggressive circumstances. And so signage is one of the things that we fully expect will be developed and designed, funded and installed coming out of our community process. There will be other tools in the box to try to make sure that Traditional bike riders are using safe speeds and courteous safe passing behavior, but I think that&#39;s not the exact focus of this order chair. But I wanted to paint that broader picture since we&#39;re doing community engagement work and trying to set up a predictable way to structure investments that the city can make to make the path even safer and honestly help all of our diverse users share that limited space more effectively at this time we do not have a detailed schedule for any signage install so i want to be clear about that the earliest that we anticipate at this moment chair would be springtime we are rapidly losing our construction season and i know it may be an item of frustration for you as board 5 counselor for that i apologize please know that our staff are reviewing engineering standards siting options and community feedback. And this is a real project with real staff hours assigned, and we expect to have many implementation steps ready to go for the new construction season in 2026. Why don&#39;t I pause there, Chair, and I&#39;m happy to answer any other questions that I can.</td>

                <td>Thank you, Director. I was very thrilled to see the community process starting and the gathering of feedback and the different ways you&#39;re doing that by having a survey, a map, and also talking to folks on the path. Definitely, I am frustrated that we still don&#39;t have signage upgrades and just overall rules on the path because this is still a very, very unsafe environment. It&#39;s still weird and safe for many community members, our seniors, our parents with strollers, because we have, especially people with motorized vehicles, but also e-bikes going at just a crazy speed. I understand that this item is not about speed. I am planning to submit a different item because I did some research over the summer. I had our policy analyst look into this and This, it sounds like a lot of it is outside of our control here in Somerville. I don&#39;t want to get to it in today&#39;s meeting, but would love to discuss it. So, yeah, I&#39;m just going to leave it at that because the speed limit is, yeah, a huge concern. Do my colleagues have any comments or questions on this item? Okay, I see no hands raised. We will mark this item as completed for now. Yes, again, actually, look, we will keep this item in committee since we&#39;re going to be discussing the speed. Hopefully next time we can just keep this item in committee so we can also get updates on the other things. And we&#39;ll move and just check in to see if Director Postaway has joined us. I do see Director Postaway. So let&#39;s take item number two. Clerk, could you please read the item?</td>

I live on Sunnyside Ave in Winter Hill, and me and many neighbors have noticed many kids walking down my street. And there are two areas that we&#39;ve noticed are a problem, which are on Walnut Street, which many kids from the Winterhill neighborhood cross over, and then Wigglesworth Street. And both of these streets have many cars that go very fast. Walnut Street has a hill that goes down and then past there. And there are dozens of kids in the morning crossing the streets. It&#39;s very difficult to see. myself and other parents in the community have requested that you put a crosswalk or in addition some types of traffic calming measures um i know you&#39;re very busy but we hope this can be a priority because there are kids walking daily and there are no crosswalks many kids are also walking on their own and i we can see that it&#39;s a dangerous situation not having any crosswalks on these streets um so Thank you. I hope you will consider adding this in.</td>

                <td>First off, I&#39;m Director Postowait, Brian Postowait. You can call me Brian from the Department of Engineering. I wanted to thank the council for bringing this back up as an order and Samantha, thank you for giving us your testimony this evening. I also have two kids in the school system here and I completely understand the, the goal and the desire to have children be able to walk to school in our community. It&#39;s one of the few communities in the country, frankly, where students can really walk to school and feel comfortable traveling around the city. And that is both a personal and professional goal to make that easier for everybody, especially students at our school system to do so. This particular issue came up about 18 to 24 months ago, right after the Winter Hill was moved from the Sycamore site to the Edgerly site. And the engineering division with the support of mobility did refresh a number of crosswalks in this neighborhood in particular, as well as construct a new crosswalk at Marshall, because the goal at that time was to create a very clear pedestrian corridor from the Otis Street Bridge to the Sycamore School site, knowing that there were still a number of students and should be a number of students walking from that area of the neighborhood to the Otis Bridge and on to Edgerly. So that has been our focus over the and we were able to install those about a year and a half ago. I hear you on the request for Sunnyside. This is something that we have to vote on both sides of Sunnyside. These are both crosswalks. The Walnut Street crosswalk is probably more warranted because it is a busier street and the crosswalk currently at Bonaire and the and the nearest crosswalk at Pearl are about 700 feet apart, which is about 100 to 150 feet further than we would prefer it. Wigglesworth is a little harder of an argument because it&#39;s such, relatively speaking, a quieter local street than many of our streets in the city that have student age populations walking on them. Both of them we have been looking into The most challenging piece here is weighing the priority of doing it for this location versus all of the other locations in the city that have similar and equally valid requests. We get similar requests from West Somerville Neighborhood School, Kennedy, Argenziano, Healy, et cetera. So I don&#39;t wanna minimize this concern, But I do want to express that these are common concerns from all of our school neighborhoods throughout the school. And we&#39;re having to weigh all of them and prioritize them appropriately. This is one that we will absolutely be putting in the hopper to review over the next few months. In particular, I believe that there&#39;s a good chance that we can prioritize this on the sooner side because we are currently in the process of designing and contracting the West Pearl project. One of the challenges from a construction standpoint is is hiring contractors to do the work and not have them bounce all around the city because it&#39;s really complicated, both from construction management, but also from a cost standpoint. So the fact that we have a construction project approximate to this area, I think there&#39;s a greater chance that we can make this work on the sooner side. So I don&#39;t want to give you any promises that I can&#39;t keep tonight, but I do want to give you a little insight of the importance that we place on these requests and what abilities that we might have in the near term to execute them. So I hope that gives Samantha both you some insight, anyone else from the public, but also the council and chair for bringing this to, or not bringing this to our attention, but reminding of the importance of this.</td>

                <td> Yeah, thanks, Chair. I guess I just want to make the simple but quick point here that if people are looking at this and saying, well, why would we do something like this for a temporary situation? Because obviously the Winter Hill School is temporarily at the Edgeley. They&#39;re going to be there for, according to the latest timeline, the next six years. So, you know, this is not something that&#39;s being done for a one or two year temporary situation. And then beyond that, you know, the edge really is going to be swing space. Like, should we need to do another school project somewhere else in terms of building another school? It&#39;s important that we have these connections there. And I just want to draw comparisons to with bike networks, the weakest link that people talk about where the weakest part of that commute of that walk is going to be, that&#39;s what people are going to judge the entire safety of that commute on is basically the, it&#39;s that portion. And I think what we&#39;re hearing about here is that weakest link of that journey that folks are making to that school.</td>

And I just want to say that I understand directly post-await that you have to... For construction and trying to manage different projects, but... The schools, you know, we don&#39;t have a million schools. I think should all be prioritized. I was just talking to neighbors today about actually just not having a speed hump near the Kennedy and know how a neighbor, you know, dog got hit and killed um it could have been a child i think when it comes to schools whether it&#39;s feed humps whether it&#39;s crosswalks it&#39;s really important that we prioritize them um you know, these cost money, but it&#39;s all worth it because again, we have children here who are using these areas and having to cross streets. And, um, so I just, um, I guess what I&#39;m trying to say is let&#39;s prioritize these. And if it&#39;s a funding issue, um, please let us know so we can, you know, try to do something, especially during budget season. I see Director Rossington raised. Director Rossington,</td>

I wanted to make sure that constituents and counselors remember that as the city staff get into our due diligence, there are many, many criteria that we must review to cite a new crosswalk. As Brian noted, the number of requests that we receive to paint a new crosswalk is really substantial. And one of the hard messages that we often have to deliver is that we have to construct accessible curb ramps, which means time and money. We&#39;ve talked about both of those things already this evening, Chair, but just to add a tiny bit more for the work ahead, we cannot typically install new ramps where there are utility poles hydrants other types of utility structures like catch basins or manhole and access points driveways are another impediment to citing accessible crosswalks and new curb ramps you have worked with us counselor or chair you have worked with us on this exact question at lowell street near the green line station and so we just use every opportunity to educate ourselves and our constituents about some of the technical challenges as we try to do something that really seems like a layup right to build and install a new accessible crosswalk so the staff know how to do our due diligence we will be reviewing that and communicating with school community ward counselor and others as we work through those processes but i just wanted to remind us that there are many impediments that we will encounter. And so the exact locations sometimes vary from the ones that folks advocate for. Thank you.</td>

But siting them is unlikely to be exactly at the intersections. But what I&#39;ve kind of figured out is I&#39;m trying to place out the desire line and trying to fit crosswalks between the blocks if I can&#39;t get them right at the intersection. Those are sometimes the balances that we make because one of the biggest challenges is just the detailed design of making the sidewalk accessible. So that all the slopes are correct. And I know this is a level of detail that you shouldn&#39;t have to worry about. Like, we take care of it. But it does mean that we can&#39;t always get it exactly in line with an intersection, especially on our really narrow sidewalks in really small, tight street neighborhoods like this.</td>

I live at 5 Maxwell&#39;s Green, and I&#39;m here about the intersection where the community path crosses School Street. This intersection has a nasty corner on it due to a 90 degree turn and some fencing and screening that is there. and i found this area worrying enough that i took it upon myself to install a convex mirror at the corner so folks could see before they took that turn and even as i was hanging the mirror i had a number of people stop to thank me and i at one point hosted a meeting of residents who were concerned about the intersection and a dozen people showed up on a wednesday night so clearly this is not just my concern there&#39;s a bunch of residents in somerville that would like this fixed as well I&#39;m very encouraged to see the city moving forward to address the issue. And so I&#39;m just here to add one more voice saying this matters to us. This is worth prioritizing. I hope the fact that a resident felt compelled to install safety infrastructure themselves underscores some of the urgency there. I can&#39;t wait to see the mirror come down once we have something better and more permanent. Thank you for your time and for taking action on this issue.</td>

                <td> Thank you, Cher. I know that we&#39;ve spoken about this particular intersection in the past. I think it is worth reminding us that this has been a very important topic for both the engineering division and the council since this was first installed. Director Ross and I might need your help in reminding me what I think that was in 21 or 22 that this was first constructed. But we have been looking for solutions for this since at least 2020 when the city was reviewing design plans for the GLX. This is not a new issue, and counselors and the city have been aware of this and have been working diligently for years to resolve this. This has been an understandably difficult intersection to resolve, predominantly because of the intersection of two really high-profile construction projects, both the high school and the GLX. but also multiple jurisdictions being both the city, the MBTA and MassDOT. These are the challenging projects that the city actively is working on. And I think the council is just witnessing the difficulty and the challenge it is and the time it takes to resolve these well. This past year, we were able to hire a consultant to... do the due diligence and design that Mass Highway was going to require by their bridge team for any changes to the bridge that would be required to ease this corner. Because it is impossible to make any changes here without changing the bridge structure short of taking adjacent properties. We are about a third of the way through the design process. And we&#39;re getting really close to having designs that we can share publicly and start discussing with MassDOT. We anticipated about a month ago, we anticipated those to be ready in October. And so that&#39;s where we stand right now. And we&#39;ve had some conversations with our consultant over the past couple months to fine tune those, but they&#39;re not ready for public discussion yet. And as soon as they are, I would be happy to have that conversation here in committee. So from that respect, I would respectfully ask for the chair to consider holding this in committee till October when I anticipate that we will have plans that we actually can share.</td>

                <td>Thank you, Brad. That was just another way of saying that we work so closely as a team that either of us could probably answer this question quite intelligently. So, yes, our teams have been working on this particular intersection for a number of months now, nigh on a year or two, depending on how far back you want to go. And this particular left turn has been a... a particular topic point, not least that Councilor Ewen-Campen put an order into it. So happy to discuss this. The real upshot of this is twofold. One, The, the request for signal is we&#39;ve reviewed the traffic counts we&#39;ve reviewed the the the traffic in this area and the operations at this intersection and A left turn signal is not the most appropriate solution here, predominantly because it&#39;s a through left straight lane and most of the traffic continues on to the Washington Street intersection where they turn left there. And so having a left turn here would be rather confusing to motorists because it is inconsistent with the other operations on this particular lane. What is more appropriate and what we have installed, I believe either just prior or just after this order was forced put in, was, and we&#39;ve had it in the works for a while, is installing a left turn after stop sign. And so what that does is it allows motorists, if they&#39;re the first in line at that red light and they want to take a left, they can proceed with their left turn upon stopping, checking both ways, and then proceeding. Not unlike a right turn upon a full stop during a red light. There&#39;s only one other place in the city that has a similar left turn sign after stop, which is at the corner of I&#39;ll get this wrong, but a summer in Qatar. And because it&#39;s also a similar place where you have nominally a one way to a one way with a left turn. And so given those conditions, that was the most appropriate action at this case, at this location, because Most of the people stopping at this red light aren&#39;t turning left. Most of them are continuing straight in order to turn left on Washington Street. So we didn&#39;t want to give mixed messages that they were getting a pass to turn left on Washington Street early and potentially go straight instead to go to Washington Street. So it was more appropriate to put a left during the red light after a complete stop. And that sign was posted. And so it does allow anybody in that left lane who&#39;s turning left to continue even during a red light.</td>

Through you, I just want to thank Director Postlewaite for going through that explanation because I&#39;ve certainly found as a counselor that when it comes to infrastructure, when it comes to issues like this, the simple answer is often not quite that simple. We have requests as counselors to do a lot of things, put a stop sign here, put a speed bump there, make this a one-way street. And the reality is often far more complex than it would otherwise seem. And I appreciate the director kind of laying out the complexities because I think it provides the public with a more realistic sense of all the decisions that have to be made and factors that have to be Wade, in order to do something as simple as, no, just put a sign there. Well, okay. But then when you look at the totality of all the road users and their behaviors, often it&#39;s not that straightforward. Glad that it&#39;s already done. Glad that we could have the discussion. Thank you.</td>

Again, this is, I live very close, so I always walk to magoon square but this is uh this came from the small businesses there um and they can reach out again if there&#39;s any language that&#39;s like brief that would help but i think just putting the magoon square there perhaps somebody could reach out to me i i obviously need a little bit more direction than that thank you yeah i can connect you and uh That way, you know, we&#39;ll have a sign that addresses this issue. Thank you, director. We will mark this item is completed. Then we clerk to please read item number 8.</td>

                <td>Thank you, Brad. Thank you, Chair. I was looking back to see when the Do Not block, the intersection sign may have been removed. And I just haven&#39;t been able to find out exactly when it was removed, but it may have been removed in some of the construction that&#39;s been there for the past few years. But one of the key components of these signs is we don&#39;t just put up a do. Our standard now and our policy now is not just to put up a do not block sign. Honestly, most people don&#39;t follow a simple sign anyway, especially a non-standard sign and especially a sign that only has information in text. So we do try to couple that always with a do not block sign. street markings or pictorial symbolic signage wherever possible, especially for these non-standard situations. This has not been a priority to return predominantly because it doesn&#39;t meet the safety criteria that we&#39;re looking to solve with do not block the box or do not block the intersection symbology. And our policy is focused on two key things when we&#39;re looking at this. One is we&#39;re looking at fire department emergency response. So when there is an intersection that is regularly blocked during or regularly blocked that would impact an emergency response, then we install them. Probably some of the most obvious ones are at Lowell and Somerville Avenue. and at the Teal Square Fire Station, but we do have others throughout the city because they are critical for emergency response. The second reason is if blocking the intersection could potentially negatively impact the operation of a signalized intersection adjacent to it. And That happens when if blocking the box could end up resulting in a gridlock condition where you can&#39;t get the traffic to move because people are blocking the intersection that allows traffic to move. And so those are the two priorities. What we have explicitly not been prioritizing is impacts to side streets because of that. We don&#39;t want to be using these in so many locations through the city that they don&#39;t mean anything anymore. One of the biggest challenges with traffic signal operations and traffic operations in general, if you use the same tool too much, people stop paying attention to them. And people find that, oh, they can excuse this one on themselves. So we really try to use tools like do not block the intersections for locations that have clear safety implications to it, not just a convenience implication to it. If this was a real problem that warranted, if the signalization was backed up through Hinkley on such a regular basis, which it sometimes does at the Lowell Street intersection, which you&#39;re probably aware of. then that do not block may be appropriate. But that&#39;s just not the case at this intersection. And we don&#39;t want to get into a place where we&#39;re putting this on every single side street that&#39;s within a couple hundred yards or a couple hundred feet from a signalized intersection.</td>

                <td> Chair, thanks through you to the board counselor for placing this item. I&#39;ll provide a quick little summary here and then happy to continue the conversation. As you know, Chair, we have many ways for streets to enter the pipeline for staff review and consideration for traffic calming. And orders like Councilor McLaughlin&#39;s order are one of those ways. So we have added Pinckney Street to our list of candidate streets. As a reminder, this is a very long list. We have way more demands for traffic calming than we can accommodate in any given year or two. But we will start that due diligence process and look for ways to communicate with residents about how to stay involved. The second part of this order, Chair, asks us to consider Neighbor Ways treatments. And as counselors know, the Neighbor Ways program has really taken off well in East Somerville. And we&#39;re grateful to Councilor McLaughlin for working with us on those efforts. Um, the official citywide bicycle network plan does create a 2030 and a 2040 kind of planning milestone to build out our network of safe streets, including neighbor ways. I think it&#39;s important to note that the plan does not include Pinkney street as a neighbor way. That doesn&#39;t mean we would never consider such a thing chair, but it&#39;s not on the official plan. One block over Florence Street running parallel is on the official plan. And so as we get closer to looking at that neighborhood holistically, we can speak with the ward counselor, we can speak with neighbors about the relative needs and merits of Florence versus Pinckney versus Mount Vernon in that portion of East Somerville. So I want to validate and appreciate the advocacy work that Councilor McLaughlin and neighbors are doing. I want to let folks know that we will review Pinkney for traffic calming potential, and we will clearly communicate, is this a one, two, three, or four-year journey ahead, just because of the magnitude of demands that we&#39;re trying to meet citywide. And then in terms of any neighborhood ways, treatments, again, that&#39;s not on our priority network, but we&#39;re happy to continue that conversation with the counselor and with community members. So hopefully that&#39;s a helpful initial response, Chair. Happy to answer any other questions.</td>

                <td> Chair, through you, thanks for this order, and thank you for all the counselors who have been involved in this process. If it&#39;s okay, Chair, maybe I&#39;ll suggest a quick summary of how we got where we are, provide some basics about the potential paths ahead, and then happy to answer questions. There is definitely ongoing conversation in the months and even the years ahead. So I view this as a step in a larger process. For counselors or community members who are interested in the history and how we got here, I strongly recommend checking out the formal public meeting of the city&#39;s Pedestrian and Transit Advisory Committee from July 17th, which is a regular monthly meeting of our Pedestrian and Transit Advisory Committee where staff and committee members discuss this issue at some length. So there&#39;s video footage, there&#39;s slides that staff presented. But to quickly summarize, Chair, back in 2022, the MBTA Board of Directors approved a long-range bus network redesign plan for the entire MBTA service area. At that time, Route 90 changes did not include elimination of the East Somerville leg of Route 90. What I mean by that, Chair, is today the bus uses Pearl Street between McGrath and Cross, it uses Cross Street between Pearl and Broadway, and it uses Broadway between Cross and Sullivan. The official MBTA network redesign anticipated some changes, actually combining Route 88 and Route 90 to achieve better frequency and honestly more predictability for riders as well. But it anticipated keeping the 90 in the heart of the East Somerville neighborhood using Pearl and Cross and Broadway. But Chair, after the Green Line extension opened, MBTA staff started to get very focused, and understandably so, get focused on trying to provide a bus to Green Line link. They felt that ridership on the Highland Avenue buses, Route 88 and Route 90 today, really could benefit from a slightly better connection to Green Line rail service. And it&#39;s really interesting because we all know as residents, as writers, that you can kind of look down the hill from Highland Avenue and think that the Magoon Station or Gilman Station offer some of that interconnection. And yet, I think we all know that the steep grades of those sidewalks coming down from Highland Avenue really do create access barriers. And so MBTA staff began focusing on the East Somerville Station at the corner of Washington and Joy and Top Street. City staff did not feel good about this as a conclusion. And we also did not feel good about this in terms of community outreach and engagement and notification in part because the official network redesign did not include that change, Chair. We were unsuccessful in slowing down that process. And so MBTA initiated this service change, pulling the 90 bus off of the heart of East Somerville neighborhood streets and running it down McGrath southbound to Washington Street, where it could provide that green line connection at the East Somerville station. And as counselors are aware, Somerville residents do what Somerville residents do and rose up and had a letter writing campaign, lots of forceful and yet diplomatic advocacy. And we&#39;re grateful for everybody who volunteered their time to do these things. But it&#39;s complicated. There is logic and perspective in what MBTA staff recommended with this interchange. And yet we as city staff and city residents felt like community members who really do rely on that convenient bus from high school to East Somerville had not been appropriately consulted and had potentially had worse transit outcomes. Chair, as you know, mobility staff do more than 100 outreach events per year. And in many of our outreach events this year, we were hearing from high school students who were saying, my day-to-day has fundamentally changed, and I didn&#39;t learn about it with enough time to make adjustments. People were shocked and upset. And as they thought about their one-seat ride from home in East Somerville over to the high school, for example, that&#39;s just one use case, but it&#39;s something that we find to be impactful and powerful and important. So Mayor Ballantyne worked with General Manager Phil Eng and said, we have community concern here. What are our options, General Manager? And to the General Manager and his team&#39;s credit, they said, we will work together with you on this. And so in June, we did a site walk. city staff and the mayor were able to meet with the general manager and staff from MBTA and really explore the Somerville neighborhood, understand some of the challenges to bus service on that cross street corridor and come to a mutually agreeable conclusion that if the city were to make some safety improvements for bus operators, including creating a little bit more turning space at the intersection of Cross and Broadway, that the MBTA would bring back that service at least for a period of time. And so we&#39;re happy to report, Chair, that Route 90 bus is now restored to Pearl Street, Cross Street, and Broadway as of the end of August. I do want to caution all of our community members. The logic that the MBTA staff have articulated is still valid and it&#39;s still important to them. We have simply asked that MBTA connect with our community members for some public consultation and everybody can understand one another&#39;s perspective and try to find the best medium or long-term solution. We do see value in combining Route 88 and Route 90 to get better service frequencies. We do see the value of green line connections, but it&#39;s also really important for us that disproportionately environmental justice populations in and around East Somerville have maximum number and convenience of transit connections. North-South bus service is something that the city council and our staff and our community members have advocated for for a long time. And even though it doesn&#39;t come very frequently, Route 90 bus does provide some of that north-south connectivity today. So I&#39;m happy to report that after a long journey over the last six months, we&#39;re in a good holding pattern for now with buses running, serving the East Summerwell Community School, the Winterville at Edgerly, and critically for East Somerville residents, workers, and others who want to get to the library, to the high school, to City Hall, or over to Davis with a one-seat bus. So sorry if that went on a little bit longer, but Chair, the language of this order, I think, did ask for kind of some of the background about how we got here. Why don&#39;t I pause and have you answer any questions you may have?</td>

And I think it&#39;s worth telling that story because this is, at the end, we were able to reinstate this really important route, the nine-year route. And I personally have been following this conversation very closely. The council, community members, the administration, we all work together. As you mentioned, this is an essential route because many of our high school students take this bus to get to the high school. These are parents who can&#39;t drive, don&#39;t necessarily own cars, or don&#39;t have the capacity to drive their kids to school. So I am very, very glad that we were able to um make that happen and um yeah so for now uh this is great and i understand that the mbta will try and eventually um yeah so we will we&#39;ll worry about that when it happens uh but for now i&#39;m just glad all right uh consular brownlee</td>

Was the removal of parking a part of the negotiation process with the MBTA to make sure that the 90 could operate? Could you talk us through that and potentially like how many spots were reallocated to make room for the 90?</td>

                <td> Chair, through you, thank you for the question. Yes, the short answer is that the MBTA safety and operations team described to us a daily challenge of navigating Cross Street, which is exceptionally narrow. In fact, it&#39;s substantially narrower than most streets that carry MBTA bus service. So, frequent reports of side swipes, of mirrors, or even of more routine delay associated with vehicles getting stuck and not being able to make turns, missing light cycles, engaging gridlock are common stories from the operators at the bus garage that serves this route. And so the general manager and the MBTA team described these issues to us and said, we are willing to move the bus back to this neighborhood, but it&#39;s really important for us to keep our operators, our riders, and the public at large safe. And it&#39;s also really important for us to not lose five minutes at a time if you have these moments of gridlock and traffic congestion because a truck is turning in front of a bus and can&#39;t make it and has to make a three-point turn and navigate around a parked car. And so this was, in terms of next steps, the recommendation was to restrict parking closest to the signalized intersection at Cross and Broadway. And I will note, Chair, that there are bus stops at this location as well. I should have mentioned that a minute ago, that the historic bus stops at this location are much shorter than MBTA standards. So buses were having a hard time getting to the curb, which is really important from an accessibility standpoint, but then also getting off the curb and positioning themselves for the movements at the right-hand turn. eastbound or the left-hand turn from cross to southbound, from Broadway to cross. So it&#39;s a complicated puzzle, tight geometry and parking restrictions are the technical tool that we often use in terms of things like fire lanes and bus turning radius. So that was the direction that staff recommended and that MBTA said was essential for them to bring back the bus at this location.</td>

Um, You know, there&#39;s a concern about being able to park in this residential neighborhood. Because once we get off Broadway, it is full of homes right there at Cross. Being able to park near your home, being able to turn into, there is a lot right near that intersection as well, which now has not an actual island, but a, you know, a tainted island. you know, kind of divider in the middle of the street.</td>

                <td> Chair, through you, let me quickly provide a little context and note that I think the engineering and mobility team have a little work to do with the word for counselor to understand the intent of this order. Counselors will remember that installing stop signs can be one of those things that Counselor Burnley acknowledged a minute ago, seems simple on its face and there are many complexities as you start to dig into the details. federal standards and guidelines do obligate roadway owners to perform certain analyses and to demonstrate compliance or consistency with certain criteria or warrants in order to install new stop control, new stop signs. Roadway owners like the city can take on liability if we fail to do those due diligence steps and goodness forbid a crash occurs. So we take seriously the due diligence necessary to consider installing new stop signs. And if we cannot meet those criteria, then we try to work with residents and counselors to solve a problem in a different way. So we have not yet initiated any due diligence of this particular location. I think Brian and I and our teams want to reach out to Councilor Clingan to just make sure that we understand the problem that residents are identifying. We know this location, its adjacency to the state highway at Route 28. We would like to understand where is the cut-through traffic going and coming from, where are the speeds or compliance records the worst, and then that&#39;ll allow us to provide a more thoughtful response. So I don&#39;t think we have a ton else to report on this evening, Chair, but Brian, please feel free to chime in if I&#39;m missing anything.</td>

                <td> Thank you, Chair. I did look back in the record. We had discussed this, I believe, in the spring. But I don&#39;t think we had gotten into much detail about it. And I think as we&#39;ve looked at this particular intersection over the past few months, frankly, the level of analysis that we need to conduct to get to the level of coming up with a conclusion isn&#39;t one that we can just do in isolation because it has a lot of impact with the other intersection, particularly Willow that&#39;s adjacent to it. I know last time we spoke, we were concerned about the signal cabinets being able to handle a substantive change in the signaling. And that has been proven to be the challenge here in particular. And, and, Right now, though, we do have a program. Jessica Bello, our senior traffic engineer, has been really good at looking at and moving forward on, frankly, a decades-long backlog of traffic signals. We believe that brings us to a juncture here. One is that This isn&#39;t an effort that we can realistically just do as a one-off. We&#39;re in the process of doing a lot of other signal upgrades, particularly for emergency vehicles. It&#39;s late, my mouth isn&#39;t working well. Emergency vehicle preemption. And so the next best way to handle this, and especially because of Willow Street, is to couple this into a larger construction project. And I feel that that&#39;s gonna be the best way to go for this particular challenge, because we do have in the five-year plan, to reconstruct the Broadway intersection through Ball Square, basically the section of Broadway from Ball Square to the Powder House Rotary, comparable project to what we discussed a few moments ago regarding the Mugun Square intersection in the Central Broadway area. So we do anticipate this being, this project coming in the next few years. We haven&#39;t prioritized exactly what year this would fall into. But I think that&#39;s going to be the best place where we&#39;re going to have the most correct answer that can be executable here. I think that&#39;s going to be the best answer, and I know that&#39;s not the answer you&#39;re looking for. But you should know me by now. I&#39;m as honest as I possibly can be on these things.</td>

                <td> Brett KenCairn, Chair thanks for putting this order on the agenda, thanks to counsel mclaughlin for filing it, this is going to be another one of those answers from the staff perspective that includes will look at it. Brett KenCairn, It can be complicated to find the right types of street crossings where specific signal ization is helpful. And should be prioritized city staff are currently going through a prioritization process to establish criteria for when we use this particular type of rapid flashing beacon. and chair, I&#39;m sorry if I&#39;m using technical terminology. When we say rapid flashing beacon, I think the councilor&#39;s order and the way that I&#39;m describing it would be a crosswalk sign that uses rectangular yellow flashing signs and is operated by a pedestrian pressing a button. We see examples of this on East Broadway at the library We see examples of this in Somerville in the heart of the Union Square Plaza at the bus stops by the farmer&#39;s market and the main intersection there on the square. So staff are currently reviewing how these types of signs are working citywide and how we can set priorities for investing in them and using them to improve safety and visibility at different crosswalk types citywide. Typically, we use these on multi-lane crossings. So again, think about East Broadway near the library where you have two lanes in one direction. These are like longer crossings that can be associated with slightly higher speeds. We don&#39;t typically use them on narrow streets like Cross Street, but I don&#39;t want to presuppose that we never would. often we find share that physical traffic calming is the best way to solve these problems, slowing down motorists so you improve visibility. We&#39;ve been able to do that on Cross Street with a lot of community buy-in. So we&#39;re excited about that with the raised crosswalk at this exact location, Cross and Everett. But if the ward counselor is continuing to hear concerns from community members, we will take those seriously and we&#39;ll continue to evaluate this location and see if any different signage could be warranted or helpful. I don&#39;t wanna make promises before we go through that technical review process, but we will work with Councilor McLaughlin and his constituents to understand the problem and try to continue making investments to support safe crossings in front of our schools.</td>
