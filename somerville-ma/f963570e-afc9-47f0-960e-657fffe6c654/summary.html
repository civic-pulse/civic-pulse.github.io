<p><strong>Executive Summary:</strong>
The Somerville Zoning Board of Appeals convened remotely to address several zoning matters. Key actions included the approval of the August 20, 2025, meeting minutes and the continuation of the 872 Broadway case to October 1, 2025. The Board also granted a hardship variance for ZP25-000048 at 8-8A Melvin Street, allowing for a dormer face width of 11 feet 7 inches, despite the maximum allowed width being 8 feet 4 inches, citing the unusual character of the existing structure and potential financial hardship. The applicant subsequently withdrew applications ZP25-000047 and ZP25-000049 without prejudice.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Applicant Presentation:</strong> Rob Passione from The Architectural Studio presented on behalf of the applicant.<ul>
<li>The proposed dormer was reduced to 11 feet 7 inches in width, which the applicant stated meets the dormer separation requirement.</li>
<li>The revised design includes two windows instead of the previous three, addressing a zoning variance violation related to solid wall width.</li>
<li>The applicant expressed a preference for the original 13-foot 1-inch dormer to accommodate a more functional kitchen for the affordable unit, but acknowledged the Board's previous feedback.</li>
<li>The dormer is located on the side of the building, not facing the street, minimizing visual impact.</li>
<li>Krishna, a partner of the applicant, clarified that the existing bathroom dormer was pre-existing, and only the window within it was replaced with a casement window of the same size.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Public Comment:</strong> No members of the public offered comments or questions.</li>
<li><strong>Board Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li>Brian Cook clarified that the 13-foot 1-inch dormer would require two hardship variances, as discussed at the August 20th meeting.</li>
<li>Anne Brockleman confirmed that the unit is an officially approved affordable unit.</li>
<li>The Board focused on the 11-foot 7-inch dormer option, which would require only one variance for the dormer face width (ZP25-000048).</li>
<li>The discussion centered on satisfying the hardship criteria for the variance.<ul>
<li><strong>Criterion 1 (Unusual Shape/Features):</strong> The Board considered the "unusual character of the existing structure" and the configuration of the existing roof as limiting factors for creating a functional third apartment.</li>
<li><strong>Criterion 2 (Financial Hardship):</strong> It was noted that literal enforcement (requiring removal and complete redesign) would impose significant financial hardship on the applicant.</li>
<li><strong>Criterion 3 (No Detriment to Public Good):</strong> The Board previously concluded that there would be no detriment to the public good or impact on the neighborhood residence zone.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Chair Susan Fontano expressed strong disapproval of the initial non-compliance, emphasizing that such behavior is unethical and disrespectful to the city and the Board. She stated that while she would vote to approve to avoid further hardship, it should not set a precedent.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Motion (ZP25-000048):</strong> Brian Cook moved to approve the hardship variance for ZP25-000048 for relief from the Somerville Zoning Ordinance dormer face width standards, for a dormer face width of 11 feet 7 inches, when the maximum allowed width with the newly revised dimensions would be 8 feet 4 inches, based on the hardship criteria findings as discussed and with the conditions set forth in the second supplemental staff memo dated September 11th, 2025.</li>
