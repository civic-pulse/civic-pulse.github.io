                <td>Good evening. Hi. Here we are. My name&#39;s Rob Passione. I&#39;m from the architectural studio. And I believe the applicants may also be online right now, but I can certainly start and show you guys what we updated. So if I could share my screen. Okay, can everybody see that? So what we, scroll down real quick. So what we talked about is that we put together a plan that shows the dormer now reduced down to 11.7 inches. And this is basically the same exact dimension that we had was originally approved by the city of Somerville. And in our opinion, with this 11 foot dormer, it does meet the requirement for the dormer separation. And would obviously meet the width of that total ridge length added up with the existing dormer, which we have talked about last meeting. I think the last size dormer, we have met that as well. We took out a window here. As you can see, we did have three. Now we have two. So that actually is still a zoning variance violation with this dormer configuration. So we&#39;re over 36 inches of solid wall width. HAB-Jacques Juilland, What we did was we we basically slid this over we rotated the fridge to put it underneath the existing of the existing plane of the the roof, which will be rebuilt here. HAB-Jacques Juilland, You know full size fridge doesn&#39;t unfortunately fit under here, so we&#39;d have to do either countertop fridge or a very small fridge to get the height to work. HAB-Jacques Juilland, And then we essentially slip the. the peninsula over and just create kind of a small alcove kitchen here. So from our perspective, we thought this kitchen was not ideal. It&#39;s just kind of a really tough space in here. Phil Kleisler , there&#39;s not much cabinetry, the reason we kept it as two windows was because we do have some upper cabinets over here. Phil Kleisler , which we want to do, at the very least, keep those just to give them some storage options, so we, you know we would. Phil Kleisler , Preferably try to stick with the previous selection, where we have a much, as you can see kind of comparing the two dormers with the the wider door at 341 you know, considering it would be a much larger kitchen. This is an affordable unit. So we want to try to, you know, at least provide a sort of full size functional kitchen that that could be used for this third floor. So while we did, we did, you know, update the kitchen layout and make the dormer smaller, we would like to petition to try to go back to what we had originally with the 13.</td>

                <td>Yeah, so, so what I what I also included in this. This application update is what we have existing now for dormers, because that was a request that came up last meeting. So this is the current configuration. So as you can see, we have the existing condition, the dormers are very close together. This is actually looking at the rear of the structure. So this is that living room area. This is the new dormer in question. So as you can tell, this was the roof pitch that we were dealing with, and it&#39;s quite steep, so that was the entire purpose of the dormer and one of the reasons why we had pushed the kitchen that had originally been designed on this side over to the other side. And then this is just an image of the front of the structure. Again, it&#39;s the same roof pitch that is on the back of the structure, so the gable runs all the way through. And then this is just an example of the... David Ensign PB, David Ensign PB, of the existing kitchen right now, so what this is the window that we took out. David Ensign PB, David Ensign PB, So basically where the new kitchen would come in, would be an 11 foot dormer would be roughly right here so that&#39;s approximately that line is with a 13 for one dormer selection. David Ensign PB, David Ensign PB, it&#39;s it&#39;s more back here so that&#39;s kind of difference between the two and where we were showing in the 11 foot dormer you know the refrigerator and essentially going here. Rob Leibowitz, You know, up against this area, but then we have the roof pitch that&#39;s coming along with this and that&#39;s kind of where clips here, so the front is not the issue it&#39;s in the back was this refractor comes down pretty sharply so.</td>

Phil Kleisler, You know, from our perspective it&#39;s just a really tiny kitchen that we don&#39;t think meets what someone would expect to find in this neighborhood in this city. Phil Kleisler, So that was sort of our our thought process we did want to obviously show the 11 foot seven to illustrate why we thought it was going to be tough, and you know that. Phil Kleisler, The refrigerator is kind of maybe the worst part of it because it&#39;s tough to get it in there, but we know just overall we were just. PB, Harmon Zuckerman, Sort of, you know, unfortunately, PB, Harmon Zuckerman, Trying to come up with a good way to make work or, you know, is this going to be a kitchen that is going to make sense for this apartment and PB, Harmon Zuckerman, You know, we just, we just were looking at the 13 foot one and it was just a considerably larger more useful kitchen. PB, Harmon Zuckerman, And that, you know, signing it over even that one foot and a half really made a big difference in the quality of the kitchen so So again, just to reiterate, we really would prefer and would really like to stick with the 13-foot one. But again, obviously that&#39;s your guys&#39; call, but that&#39;s where we&#39;re at with it.</td>

It was not approved, so I don&#39;t find it productive to. Present two options and like it&#39;s a design review. I mean, obviously bigger is better, but that&#39;s not really why we&#39;re here today. So can you present? The most. Yes, but that is 11.

So to me, that&#39;s what&#39;s unusual. And if we were to literally enforce it, which meant also moving the windows, that would be a financial hardship. So we&#39;re still allowing a noncompliance by not shifting all the windows over or putting in larger windows, but just removing the third window. Does that make sense?</td>

And you&#39;ve put us in a hard spot from the beginning when you allowed this to happen, Omar. And I&#39;m so sorry that it played out the way it did because I don&#39;t believe all that we&#39;ve been told. And i think that you&#39;re you guys are making out because i&#39;m not a spoiler and i&#39;m not going to have you rip the whole thing down because that&#39;s just not nice but i hope the message gets out to people who listen to these meetings uh zoom or you talk to your fellow friends or your contractors and tell them that this behavior as we go forward cannot be tolerated. It&#39;s a total disrespect to the city, to the board, and to other people at Playfair who don&#39;t put three windows. They suffer with two windows, but they make the window smaller or the cabinet smaller or the refrigerator smaller. I think from once you got approved that you were going to go with a third floor apartment, and I don&#39;t think that was ever Marguerite McLaughlin, Ever really figured out to be that, and if you the contractor that you ended up having that did this that thought he was being a nice guy and doing you a favor. Marguerite McLaughlin, You should have a chat with him and you should pass the word around that it&#39;s not right it&#39;s not fair it&#39;s unethical. Marguerite McLaughlin, i&#39;m not going to be a spoiler tonight I feel I just had to say my piece i&#39;m going to give you the vote. So it&#39;s going to carry and you go forward, but I&#39;m not happy about it. So without further ado, I apologize for boring you folks with that, but that&#39;s how strong I am about this. I&#39;ve been doing this a while, and I think I&#39;m usually very fair and understanding, but I just feel we would just mistreated. So I&#39;d like the, um, acting clerk tonight, Mr. Cook to make the motion.</td>
