We&#39;re going to start with approval of our minutes from the previous meeting. ID number 25-1253, approval of the minutes of the Finance Committee meeting of July 8, 2025. On the minutes, any discussion? Seeing none, we&#39;re going to lay that item on the table to recommend approval with a single vote at the end of tonight&#39;s meeting. Brings us to our second agenda item, ID number 25-1289. The mayor requested approval to appropriate $56,601 from the salary and wage stabilization fund to the non-contributory pension account to fund an increased pension amount. This committee received a memo yesterday from IGA, wherein Director Ed Bean of Finance explained this request. Is there any discussion on that memo? You see, it might be about to pop up on the screen. Do I wait for it?</td>

There is a member who, many years ago, there was special legislation that allowed this person, any time there&#39;s a new agreement with the police department for benefits, this person receives those benefits in their pension. So this is that pension amount that matches the recent agreement with the Somerville Police Department. I forget which party it is in which union, but that&#39;s what this is. So this is just to match the previously passed legislation to make sure we&#39;re in compliance. And this matches the recently agreed upon collective bargaining agreement.</td>

This is the FY26 CPA 50% allocation to the Housing Trust. Typically, we&#39;ve done this at the... We&#39;ve... allocated this and come for this vote in line with the rest of the CPA awards. But since this is a standard 50% that the committee approved as part of their budget, we&#39;re moving this vote up because it&#39;s just a straightforward allocation. So we&#39;re coming to you early with this one this year to hopefully get these funds to the trust and out the door and committed to projects as soon as possible.</td>

I have a little overview that I would like to read and share. So Shared Services Grant Overview, the Mass Department of Public Health, DPH, Office of Local and Regional Health, launched the Mass Municipal Public Health Shared Services Grant Program back in January 2020 with funding from the FY 2020 state budget. The program enables groups of cities and towns to plan for or to expand sharing of staff and resources to improve and strengthen core local public health services effectiveness and efficiency, with the goal to promote healthier communities across the region. The communities of Somerville and Cambridge have agreed to work together in a multi-year shared services collaborative grant opportunity. The Metropolitan Area Planning Council is serving as the fiscal agent and grant contract manager with the Department of Public Health for this project that is slated to continue through FY2027. FY2027. To date, this grant program has hired a regional coordinator, a regional community health worker, both hosted by Somerville, and is looking to hire a regional vaccine nurse hosted by Cambridge. In addition, the two communities have collaborated on a rodent mitigation effort to examine the use of non-poisonous bait stations. Thank you.</td>

So 775 for the Union Square Plaza to bring the design to 100% design. There&#39;s also a continuation of ARPA MBTA advertising, where we&#39;re going to be advertising local businesses through MBTA bus routes. And then some... police patrols, I believe, around the Broadway area, around the casino, but I can let Ms. Director Wisdom speak to that. So with that, happy to provide whatever details I can on the planned projects or open it up to any questions.</td>

So the police department has been allocated just over 300, around $308,000 in overtime funding, which equates to around 4,000 hours of overtime to be used over a two-year period. This overtime will support increased traffic enforcement patrols. as well as community engagement efforts on Thursday through Saturday evenings. This is a time when the traffic from the Kinsino is typically at its peak in that lower Broadway and East Somerville area. The goal is to enhance public safety and visibility by deploying those additional resources to the most impacted neighborhoods during these high traffic periods. The hope is this will also allow us to be active in future discussions that will help us assess how the area will be impacted as it&#39;s continued to be developed and to grow in that area.</td>

That&#39;s typically how we assign overtime from grants is in kind of four-hour blocks to people who are willing. to work overtime and are interested. So essentially, we did essentially place for two bodies, I guess two positions of overtime in those areas for, it could be four to eight hours, depending. It doesn&#39;t have to be all used in one weekend. It can be spread out, especially if they&#39;re, you know, if the minimum staffing isn&#39;t there. So it wouldn&#39;t all be in one weekend necessarily, but it could allow us to, yes, concentrate more enforcement and also opportunities for community engagement to talk with people who are impacted in that area in those communities if they&#39;re interested. and allow them to provide feedback and to also, if there is pedestrian traffic from the casino, it&#39;ll allow people to be on foot.</td>

                <td>Yes, please. On the motion. Through you, I just want to follow up. my colleague from Ward 2&#39;s point about both a bit of consternation and a bit of confusion. You know, when I think of the work that needs to be done in Union Square to actualize the vision for that neighborhood that many residents have put in over many, many years, I don&#39;t immediately think of traffic enforcement on Broadway as a means of, you know, dealing with the excesses of folks going to the casino, especially because I think straightforward common sense, and maybe straightforward common sense isn&#39;t right here, the role most probably impacted is going to be Mystic Ave, which of course we do not control. If I understand the usage of this grant for various issue areas and taking advantage of that, I feel like one aspect of this is a little, I can&#39;t say snuck in because this is a public meeting. We&#39;re having a public conversation about it. So I appreciate that. Does feel not like things going with like things. And I have a lot of, questions about the routes that are involved here. And to a point that was made earlier, and a point I&#39;ve, a point made earlier by Mr. Winston, wonderful name, by the way, and that I&#39;ve also made this point in previous meetings. I would really appreciate that information when we have this discussion. I mean, it&#39;s it feels very strange to make decisions about whether we&#39;re going to fund thousands of hours of additional uh traffic enforcement in areas when we don&#39;t have the specific areas in front of us or the routes or can make a clear delineation between if this is actually accomplishing the goals that we&#39;re that they are purported to so All that to say, supportive of my colleague at LEED-Large&#39;s recommendation that this gets pushed without a recommendation. And I hope as part of that and as part of future funding requests, we can just have the materials for the application present. That&#39;s, I think, a longstanding desire of this council.</td>

I had some concerns around the continued uses of these type of grants, given the federal government&#39;s attempts to leverage federal dollars to push municipalities like ours to increase cooperation with ICE. I&#39;ve been told that those new requirements are not in this particular grant because it is of a previous funding round. So I just wanna hear again on the record that that is the case, because I think as we move forward with these types of grants, I think the council and the administration should have some conversations about what that would mean.</td>

                <td> Sure, through the chair. So the phrase target hardening is used quite a bit in kind of the UASI grant sphere in the Homeland Security Grant Program. It essentially, it is as simple as the word say target hardening to make a area or place hardened against a threat, I guess you could say, is kind of the terminology that they use in those Homeland Security grants. So what this means is because it&#39;s under the critical infrastructure, it&#39;s really set up to kind of make sure that you can secure your infrastructure area. So some projects that have been done around the region have included security cameras or card access swiping projects so that when you enter a building, if you&#39;re not allowed to be in the building, You don&#39;t you know, you have to use a card instead of a key programs like that. Sometimes it&#39;s as simple as a fence around a like a power plant or, you know, Boston tends to use the funds for barriers. They have some of the more simple barriers that they set up during parades and events to help. guide traffic along off sidewalks. They have a little bit more heavy duty barriers that they use during events that are more like kind of concrete barriers. So just things like that, that make it a place that might be a critical infrastructure, more difficult to access or control entrance into that area.</td>

So at the time that we entered these into Legistar, we had only the Department of Mental Health was still determining what their funding for the year would be in their budget. So they only gave us the quarter one amounts, which were respectively fifty five thousand and ten thousand dollars. Since then, in the most impressive turnaround I&#39;ve ever seen, we have already received the contract for the full year. So I didn&#39;t want you guys to have to vote on it twice for a partial and then revote on the full amount. So the full amount will now be for item number 25-1304. It will be $301,000 for the entire year rather than just the quarter. Similarly for 25-1305 that will be $50,000 rather than $10,000 so that replaces again the full year rather than just one quarter. I&#39;m happy to go ahead and provide some additional information around what those grant funds cover if you would be interested.</td>

The Department of Mental Health jail diversion grant requires quarterly report data. be provided, uh, including, uh, reports on number of behavioral health related calls per year and, uh, number of those that have a trained CIT officer responding. I think that&#39;d be very interesting information. So, uh, if I could, um, through you to director wisdom, uh, if you could provide me those, uh, responsive grant documents, uh, at your, at your convenience, I&#39;d appreciate that. Of course. And, uh, And then just the observation, sir, that this is a chunk that is funding existing positions within the police department. And I think when we consider the overall commitment of funds that we have as a city relative to the budget, it&#39;s important to remember grants like these as part of our annual police department expenditure. So with that, thank you very much. I have the information I need on this one.</td>

I had put in the original request in FY25 budget year when I should have put it into the 2026 budget year. So if this discussion feels a little like deja vu, that is likely why that was a learning curve for me. I apologize. So what we had originally asked was to have approval to allocate $5,777 from our existing overtime line as a match for the grant, which is amount of $23,105. So this grant funds community youth programs, specifically the Youth Police Academy and the basketball events. um, which have been a success in building positive relationships between officers and local youth. Um, I did want to note that we do recognize the council&#39;s concern, um, around our overtime spending. And, um, I, you know, I would like to reassure you that this request is being made with those concerns in mind, um, as, as a part of the leadership, um, we here at the police department are actively reviewing how we spend overtime to ensure that every dollar is spent in an effective and conservative way. So in addition to this request, we are also, as you might see, we have kind of started applying for other grants that can help supplement our OT budget so that it&#39;s not a cost for necessarily the community directly and we can relieve some of the pressure on that overtime line. So that is the hopes in which we are doing these. So we would like to request approval for this match.</td>

                <td>Thank you, Chair. So essentially due to employee turnover in the recent years, and vendors continuing to send invoices to former staff, rather than getting updated with current staff. Some of the prior year invoices have slipped through the cracks. As I&#39;ve been building out my team, I&#39;ve made it really a priority for us to address this. We&#39;ve been reaching out to our vendors directly and have asked them to use a departmental email instead of individual contacts to kind of prevent some of these from going to old email addresses of people who are no longer here and falling through the cracks that way. That has helped improve our communication with our vendors and also help us reduce missed invoices moving forward. We&#39;ve worked very closely also to align our department processes With the city&#39;s procurement procedures around requisitions and purchase orders to allow out to kind of put together another layer of structure and accountability to go, you know, which will go a long way to preventing some of this. these issues happening again in the future. Unfortunately, I had hoped to have all of these prior year invoices addressed by FY25 and kind of start FY26 out fresh. Unfortunately, as I&#39;ve reached out to vendors, they&#39;re a little bit slow in responding. And so we&#39;ve had some outstanding invoices still kind of trickling in. as they&#39;re getting used to using that new note department invoice box so unfortunately there will be a few more in the future but we&#39;re hoping to keep that to a minimum and to eliminate it completely before the end of the fy 26 year so that we can really get a hold on on those prior year invoices oh invoices all right anything on this all right we&#39;re going to lay this one on the table to recommend approval</td>

                <td>Good evening, Chair. So we have two invoices that need to be paid. One was for some monitoring software where I had a disagreement or a misunderstanding as to this particular invoice. So the vendor was looking into it. I was waiting for them. I fell off their radar. Then they told me that it was, in fact, a valid invoice. I went back and researched, but then it fell off my radar a little bit, and so I ended up not getting paid for fiscal year 25. So that was the situation with that invoice. The other invoice for the UPSs, that ended up being an E-rate submission error. The problem with that is we have E-rate consultants continue to make these errors. So at this point, we&#39;re looking to pay this invoice to pay our vendor. And I&#39;ve already had some talks with our law department to see if we can get those funds back from the E-rate consultants since it was, in fact, a clerical error and that I feel that we should be paying for this. so the the law department at this point is waiting for me to get some information together for them so that they can go ahead and research it and then perhaps talk to our consultant to get that get those funds back from that person really appreciate that explanation colleagues any discussion counselor scott</td>

So there are this memo addresses the two items that are before you. 251301 is a prior invoice of $4,015. So the services were rendered in February 2024 and June 2024, and the invoices were not paid within the respective fiscal years because there were some discrepancies in the invoices, incorrect rates in which that didn&#39;t match the contract. So the human resources department was going back and forth with the vendor. Once those were all settled, it was after the end of the fiscal year, HR has worked with CHA, who is the vendor in this case, to clarify those issues to prevent this in the future. And these funds are being requested from dollars currently available in the HR department&#39;s professional and technical services account. Mr. Chair, would you like me to go into the second item or hold for questions before we move on to the next item, which is also contained in this memo?</td>

In this case, the invoice wasn&#39;t paid within the fiscal year because the company was bought out or it was acquired by another company and we weren&#39;t notified. The Human Resources Department was not notified until mid-July, meaning the address on the purchase order no longer matched. So we had to submit a separate purchase order. And therefore, this would prior your invoice and had to file that in fiscal year 26. So now we have the correct information and we should be able to use that moving forward.</td>

                <td>I got what you were saying. Yeah. All right. I don&#39;t see any more discussion on this. So we&#39;re going to lay those two items on the table to recommend approval. uh we&#39;re going to jump to agenda item 15 then id number 25-1283 the mayor requested approval to pay prior invoices totaling 1497.50 using available funds in the communications department food supplies and refreshment account for civic day event food uh this was uh the invoice was attached uh there&#39;s no memo for it but it&#39;s a fairly reasonable reasonably small dollar amount any discussion on this I&#39;ll just say this request comes from, it&#39;s for an invoice from Gurley&#39;s Ice Cream, ice cream provided at Civic Day. We&#39;d had that discussion earlier this year about the disparity study. And we talked about the importance of timely payment of invoices. and the impact on local vendors. We have here, local ice cream shop. I&#39;ll point out a business owned by a woman of color. And they&#39;re still waiting on payment for an event that happened back in April. And I know the invoice was issued June 10th, but we&#39;re sitting here 90 days out from that. And something&#39;s just broken when we make a local vendor wait this long to get paid. Yeah, we had a summer recess, but we got to fix our invoicing. Anything else, colleagues? All right. Items laid on the table recommend approval. We&#39;re now going to take up the final seven agenda items together and waive the readings of agenda item 16 to 22, as these are all requests to pay prior invoices with very small dollar amounts, double or triple figures. Anything on those, you can see them hopefully on the screen here, 16 down to 22. The clerk wouldn&#39;t mind just scrolling a little bit so people can see. Very small dollar amounts as you see in there. If anyone has any discussion on any of these, I won&#39;t say speak now or forever hold your peace. You obviously can talk about this again on Thursday night if you&#39;re so inclined. But for the purposes of this meeting, let&#39;s hear it if you&#39;ve got anything on these. Just want to respect people&#39;s time and not go through all seven of these here because they&#39;re small dollar amounts. Okay, I&#39;m not, I&#39;ll give people just another second because we are looking at seven items, but I&#39;m not seeing any discussion yet. All right, with that, I&#39;m going to assume we&#39;re good with these and we&#39;re going to lay all seven of these items on the table to recommend approval. That&#39;s going to bring us to the end of tonight&#39;s agenda, and Counselor Scott moves to recommend approval of the items on the table and to adjourn. Could the clerk please read the agenda items of the items up for recommendation to approve and call the roll on recommending approval of those items and adjournment?</td>
