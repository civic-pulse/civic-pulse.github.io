                <td>Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. I&#39;d like to welcome you to the Zoning Board of Appeals meeting for July 16, 2025. It&#39;s 6.01 p.m. Joining us tonight, well, first of all, pursuant to our Chapter 2 of the Acts of the 2025, this meeting of the Somerville Zoning Board of Appeals will be conducted via remote participation. A video recording of these proceedings will be available on the city website&#39;s meeting and events page or by emailing zoningboard at somerville.gov. Joining us tonight, we have a full board on hand. We have Anne Brockleman. She&#39;s our vice chair. We have Ann Fullerton. She&#39;ll be our acting clerk this evening. Zach Zaremba. And our two alternate members are Brian Cook and Sisia Daglian. And I&#39;m Ursula Susan Fontano, your chair. We have a nice agenda tonight. So without further ado, we&#39;re going to ask the acting clerk to take care of some cleanup business first.</td>

We&#39;re going to open all of them and then continue them. Thank you. The three, the three variance cases are ZP25-000058, Brickstone Builders Corp. seeks relief from SCO 4.3.11.E for facade build-out requirements in the Mid-Rise 5 or MR5 district, which requires a hardship variance. The second variance is case ZP25-000059. Brickstone Builders Corp. seeks relief from SEO 4.3.8.b for the maximum front yard setback in the MR5 district, which requires a hardship variance. And the third case associated with this address is ZP25000060, Brickstone Builders Corp. seeks relief from SEO 4.3.8.b JoAnne Hanrahan, Point D for brown story fenestration requirements for primary facade composition in the Mr five district, which requires a hardship variance I moved to continue all three of these cases until the next zoning board meeting which if staff can remind me of the date. JoAnne Hanrahan, I guess six August six.</td>

Comprehensive permit, and the approved and substantial changes in 2,022 and 2,023. But I know there&#39;s some new folks on the board. So just quick summary. This redevelopment replaces um existing obsolete state public housing at clarendon hill and west somerville with newly constructed permanently affordable housing adds new affordable and unrestricted apartments to create a mixed income community we are now excited to be close to completing the first phase which you can see here and are excited for residents to move in to their new homes in the fall this next slide CoB, Joe Taddeucci. : shows the location of this first phase and also shows the temporary condition that will exist for residents as phase two is under construction. Christopher McConkey- So the proposed modifications that we&#39;re submitting for consideration tonight, the first of which relates to the phasing since it is a multi phase project. Christopher McConkey- Originally, the site wide 40 be had contemplated a first phase, which included a market rate building that would that was. led by Red Gate Residential. That primarily market rate building has been delayed given market conditions. And the updated phasing proposes the two POA-led phases to be advanced first and the market rate building to be a part of a third phase. And this is really just intended to make sure that residents can receive their housing as quickly as possible and that the momentum is continued. um the other updates or modifications that we&#39;re requesting have come out of detailed conversations around the thoroughfare permit for this first phase stevenson amon way and as we&#39;ve worked with city staff around that thoroughfare permit we&#39;ve incorporated their detailed feedback and improvements on that thoroughfare design so the first of those thoroughfare updates are a modification of the wounder which is I think Dutch it&#39;s a fancy word for a crosswalk and enhanced wide crosswalk that prioritizes pedestrian access to the Central Park. That&#39;s shifted slightly, and the finished condition is being completed with phase 2 to make sure that doesn&#39;t get damaged, and it is part of that comprehensive park development. The next modification is a shift in the pedestrian crossings and a reduction in the crossing length at several points again incorporating staff feedback for those changes and the final modification relates to the location of street trees that have had to shift in relation to those first two changes as additional crosswalks have been added and other things have shifted slightly so the location of street trees and the location of some of the bicycle facilities has been adjusted accordingly and much more details in the staff memo that was submitted. So we appreciate the staff&#39;s close attention and support that&#39;s indicated in the memo and welcome any questions from the board.</td>

Just very quickly, just to add to what Jennifer said, we did also, in exchange for agreeing to grant the first extension now, because with all the additions that were there by the permit as written and the extension, it would have been only through July of 2029, and the applicant requested 5 years, so we agreed to that and to modify the conditions to allow for that 1st extension to be exercised. Now, in exchange for that, we are asking for reporting requirements and those we discussed them last time. Just reporting. There&#39;s also they&#39;ve all we also asked the applicant and they did provide an updated timeline for moving the laundry and the reporting is tied to that letting us know where they are in that process and how things are going. at six-month intervals beginning. First report would be due the end of March 2026. Is that correct, Jennifer? I think I got that right. Right, yes. Other than that, but she&#39;s absolutely right. We talked, we looked at these things together, and we&#39;re all on the same page this time. So hope that makes it easier for you. Yep.</td>

Kathy obviously can speak for herself, but had indicated that the requirement is what it is. It is to report where the progress is. We understand the timeline that&#39;s ahead of us. And while we have every expectation sort of in full transparency that nothing&#39;s going to look any different anytime soon, that the hope certainly is the longer out we get from today, that things are looking better all around for everyone. And that with a better economy and a better sort of just new clean slate, some point in time, hopefully everybody&#39;s coming out of this a winner. But that we did sort of have that question as well, understanding that at the very least for the first several reports starting in March of just next year, that we have no expectation that we&#39;re going to be coming forward with excellent life changing news off the bat.</td>

                <td>Hello. Thank you, Madam Chair. welcome so speak to us okay um this was a very unusual situation um the owner has a three-family unit um it was built uh turned the century um had existing uh egress stairs with rear porches uh um so uh he contacted me about repairing the stairs i went down there and found them the stairs not only the stairs but the porches themselves were in a very unsafe condition so i recommended to the owner that we replace the porches and the stairs simultaneously because of the conditions they were in um so subsequently he agreed and i went to prepare drawings for the reconstruction of the porches and the stairs only to discover that to make the the reconstructed stairs code compliant with the current codes um we had to make the width of the porch eight inches closer to the rear property setback. I approached the building commissioner because of the public safety concern, if we could get a waiver or any zoning. And he said, no, he wanted to stick with the policies at hand. And subsequently, we had to get a building property survey done and show the extension on the site plan for the additional 8 inches in width that would be needed to meet the code requirement. So the situation here is I don&#39;t know what options the board really has because it&#39;s a public safety issue. And they are in very bad repair. And this is, I discovered this last January. So we&#39;ve been trying to get this done as soon as possible. The owner&#39;s anxious to get it done. I don&#39;t have any other design alternatives to offer the owner. with the configuration of the building and the situations there. So it is indeed a hardship and public safety concern. So we&#39;re asking for relief so that we can encroach closer to the rear property line approximately no more than eight inches. It&#39;s actually less than that, but on the conservative side, we&#39;re asking for eight inches. um so i don&#39;t know what else to i can offer the owner or the board uh as any alternative here so unfortunately if if we can&#39;t get relief from the board here um i don&#39;t know how to handle the public safety concern in the building um and that does put the tenants at risk so um okay um</td>

And usually the, you know, in terms of DBA, we&#39;d like to understand the relief needed. Right. Right. So you have to subtract um i i couldn&#39;t understand the plot plan either because usually you should or even the staff report usually tells us that the setback is x inches and this is going to encroach by x inches therefore the relief is x inches um it&#39;s just a matter of um getting our documentation correct you know if we were to approve this okay um let me see if i have more and if staff understands that because i&#39;m looking at the plot plan right so you&#39;re in red you&#39;re showing is that three feet from the property line 2.93 3.1 yes i would go by the plot plan so that&#39;s proposed and what is the setback acquired staff or anyone?</td>

So the... the original permit drawings that were prepared okay were prior to us being aware that we would uh have to go to zoning we assumed that we could have delivered the um we could have delivered the new work within what was existing previously so the architectural drawings were prepared prepared prior to the survey um and it was once we realized that we could not get a waiver on public safety on the zoning um that we engaged the surveyor so his uh survey information is the reliable source um on this project um excuse me excuse me sir brian cook</td>

Although there&#39;s been a lot of confusion, I think what&#39;s clear is that the request for relief is meant to incorporate what&#39;s needed, even if the maximum provided in relief is not what they actually end up needing. So that&#39;s the point of the eight-inch further encroachment into the setback. is to give them a margin of error for completing the renovation of the stairs and decks so that they don&#39;t violate the setback any further than the building already does because it&#39;s a non-conforming rear setback for the existing structure. So rather than try to specify in the motion the exact dimensions that we have, if we give them a margin of error, which I believe is what the staff memo is proposing, even though the words are not there, then I think that obviates any need for the applicant to come back and say, whoops, we need a new or amended hardship variance because we&#39;ve discovered that the measurements are off by whatever, a couple of inches.

And because we&#39;re not... attaching the relief specifically for the egress code so um not on my watch i i can i appreciate that mr theron but we see all kinds we&#39;re going to see another case later tonight that has that kind of issue so it happens all the time um</td>

So that would give us a little more confidence that It won&#39;t go any more than that, you know, and I will do everything I can to assure that the dimensions that I provided are achieved. Part of the question here is not so much achieving the construction dimension as it is the unknown as the property the building may not be perpendicular to the property line and that&#39;s uh that&#39;s high i feel the eight inches would certainly give us that confidence it what do you think of uh this here conversation that&#39;s going on this is your case</td>

But the project has gone on forever. And the third floor, we had to, you know, the only way the city would allow us to move forward is to make it an affordable unit, which we did. So all that is done. So in the third floor, in the meantime, in this long process, we have had contractors, you know, came and went to COVID and everything. And, you know, I had let somebody else handle the construction oversight for some time. And in that timeframe, what happened was from the kitchen in the third floor, which was supposed to be on one side It was determined on the fly that the contractor would put it on the other side, because it had a longer area to work with. And so they had done it and we didn&#39;t know about it as a, you know, I&#39;m not a builder. I&#39;m not a developer. I&#39;m just a investor. So I didn&#39;t know about it. It went on and then there were several inspections along the way. Uh, but at the end, when we were trying to get certificate of occupancy, suddenly, uh, zoning board came up and said, oh, well, you&#39;re not compliant. This is Dahmer is not compliant. Um, so, uh, you know, we cannot give you a seal and after much conversation, uh, the zoning board kindly agreed to allow us to sell unit one, uh, but not the other two and assets apply for hardship variance. And that&#39;s what we have done. And that&#39;s why we are here.</td>

Is anybody living in these condos yet? and first floor is that the unit has been sold somebody&#39;s living there but second floor and third floor are empty waiting for a certificate of occupancy all right and just to make sure I&#39;m following this correctly you feel that the contractor took liberties as to go beyond what was approved because they thought that that was a better approach to the construction and that you didn&#39;t notice us what you did Well, because i&#39;m looking here, and like the minimum dormer separation, for example, it says 8 feet, and it&#39;s as built about 2 feet. I mean, that&#39;s I feel like visually to be able to tell if something&#39;s off by 6 feet. So I mean, I kind of understand where the chair is coming from a little bit. then it&#39;s a little bit hard to just see that you have somebody working on this for months and months and months and you as the owner are not really checking in to make sure it&#39;s conforming because that&#39;s your responsibility and i used to do the same thing where i would renovate houses and i was on top of them all the time because they screwed up all the time so um i&#39;m not saying you&#39;re not telling the truth but it&#39;s hard if you&#39;ve done this before to not see this sort of variation from the plans</td>

They follow the planning boards. They like to listen. They find it very educational. It&#39;s like some will learn from your problem. You see what I&#39;m saying?

                <td> Thank you, Madam Chair. I&#39;m actually following up on Zach&#39;s point and question. So if I&#39;m understanding the sequencing correctly, there was a decision to move the kitchen because of headroom necessity. So shifted to the other side, whatever exactly that meant, which meant either putting in dormers or redesigning dormers, it doesn&#39;t matter. That&#39;s where we have the problem. Whoever did the drawings on the dormers failed to attend to the zoning requirements for the dormers. And it would be good to know whether that was an architect who did that or whether it was a contractor who did it because that&#39;s the point at which we have the problem they get the construction is completed with that dormer design. And it&#39;s only then that we discover that they&#39;re not compliant with the zoning ordinance. But that means that somebody with a professional certifications making drawings and not paying attention to what the zoning requirements are for that particular part of the construction. And that&#39;s mystifying to me. It&#39;s one thing for an amateur developer to miss that, but for a professional not to attend to this, that&#39;s the more worrisome thing to me. Do we have any information from either through you, Madam Chair, to Mr. Kumar, who did the drawings, original drawings for the dormers or who made the changes to the drawings to the dormers?</td>

So I basically said, OK, well, here&#39;s a structural engineer. He&#39;ll do the framing plans. HAB-Jacques Juilland, And basically they suicide i&#39;m not sure if the contractors submitted those to the city, but that&#39;s basically where.

So the original drawings had a dormer there. It was a smaller dormer. And then what you&#39;re seeing is the as-built drawings. We went back and measured to see what was built.</td>

It&#39;s actually a many months long project. There is rough plumbing, rough electric. So there was a point at which they decided the headroom wouldn&#39;t work. They wanted to move the kitchen. They&#39;re like, oh, we can have a bigger kitchen if we move it to the other side. Oh, we&#39;ll just make the dormer bigger. I understand that Mr. Pacone may not have been aware of the the detriment when helping them but I think that Mr Kumar saying somebody else was helping out and he didn&#39;t understand what was happening is just crazy to me because you have to plan for plumbing runs so early on So to be frank, I&#39;m having a hard time swallowing this one. Yes, there is a financial problem. That&#39;s probably the only hardship part of the conditions that I can find cause for. The rest of the issues, I can&#39;t find any cause to support these hardship variances.</td>

HAB-Jacques Juilland- Separation has to be 50% of the new dormer right so you have one third one third one third right so i&#39;ve already made quick some quick calcs here. HAB-Jacques Juilland- So maybe you could take this back and consider it so if you keep that right hand edge of what&#39;s built. HAB-Jacques Juilland- yeah all the way to. the existing dormer, you have, let&#39;s say two feet plus 16, 18 feet, right? I&#39;m making one 11, two feet. Do you see that the gap one 11, I&#39;m going to round that to two feet plus 16 feet. That&#39;s 18 feet, 18 feet. The relationship is 50% of the massing has to be, the gap has to be 50%, right? So math that&#39;s six feet plus 12 feet, six feet gap. Plus 12 feet massing six feet is half of 12 feet 50% you&#39;re complying you keep the right edge that&#39;s what you need to that&#39;s what you need to bring the left hand dormer left side. Right of the existing the new built dormer in right and now I did a quick blue beam to scale that line if you strike a line down actually lands on the edge of your third window so maybe you lose that window or you say. board, can I have six inches so that you can keep the third window? That could be a hardship because you are trying to fix it. So I haven&#39;t really thought this through enough on how you can actually fix this with the least financial burden to the client. I mean, I don&#39;t doesn&#39;t feel like anyone here is going to approve this as of tonight. So what is the minimum you can do? financially for yourself, um, for the client to make the change. I don&#39;t, you know, and how that impacts the fridge, the refrigerator is not right at the edge. So it&#39;s further ends. Maybe that will clear the roof right in plan. You have the fridge there, but I don&#39;t think you need to like, Oh, rip up the kitchen, move it to the other side. I mean, I think you can creatively solve this.

                <td>I&#39;m going to. I know it&#39;s been a long evening for all of you, so I don&#39;t want to take up too much time, but I&#39;d like to just quickly set a little context for the public. My name is Pablo Picker. I&#39;m the owner of 181 Pearl Street, most of the developer. uh with me is paul miller as the architect on the project um just going back we&#39;ve started this a couple years ago looking to build three units at the site it&#39;s been a very challenging site um but we are feeling like we&#39;re on the on the home stretch here uh we have received three hardship variances from this board we are here tonight seeking a fourth uh this came out in the end uh the end of site plan approval application review from PSOF regarding the landscape buffers. Paul&#39;s going to speak a little bit about it, and we will follow the board&#39;s lead as to how much you&#39;d like for us to speak to it. But essentially it&#39;s a little quirky kind of situation where uh surface parking is not allowed within the landscape buffer our neighbor at four dana street from the beginning we we actually realized after the purchase of the property that part of his driveway was in our parcel rather than pursuing that road we this is two years ago now we&#39;ve met with him um we&#39;re very clear that we were intent on designing something not only to not mess with his driveway, but also just work within the context of our neighborhood. And so that&#39;s what we&#39;ve achieved. But we have hit this snag because surface parking cannot be within that buffer. And of course, part of his driveway is within our lot. So we are seeking a variance for that. and we look forward to the conversation with the board I will just note that the owner of for Dana also submitted a letter of support that hopefully the board received I&#39;ll let Paul quickly speak and show the site plan so the board gets a sense in the public and then if the board wishes we can read our answers to the criteria into record thank you great thank you thanks Pablo is it okay if I share my screen now please do</td>

Okay, so on the right here, I have our site plan open the proposed site plan showing the proposed three story building with three residential units, I think you all are familiar with this project from our previous meetings. There are 10-foot setbacks from the two side lot lines abutting the neighbors at 185 Pearl Street and at 4 Dana Street. And the driveway here we&#39;ve highlighted in yellow just to make it clear where that sits relative to our parcel and proposed project. So as Pablo stated, the driveway is encroaching on the 181 Pearl Street property by about three feet, six inches. And from the beginning of the design process, Pablo gave the direction that he wanted the neighbor to be able to keep their driveway and that we would design around it. So we sort of set our project boundary along the east-west running line of their driveway, as you can see here. And we were very intentional about creating a buffer between our project or between our building and the neighboring parcels and went through you know careful site design process with our landscape architect ground inc and through consultation with the urban design commission and city planning staff to create in the side lot lines it&#39;s an entirely permeable paved or planted area John Potter, And i&#39;m also happy to sort of read through our responses to the three criteria that are required if if it pleases the board, or I can turn it over here for questions.</td>

                <td>So thank you. So what we have proposed are planters that run along Pearl Street and Dana Street that would be full of native species that attract pollinators and an attractive buffer along the street that we see as a neighborhood asset. We designed a bench on the Pearl Street side to tie into the stoop culture of Somerville. We&#39;ve wrapped the planter into the site for our side entrance into the lobby. And then these brown pavers that you&#39;re seeing here are all permeable in the window well, which provides light to the bedrooms that are in the lower level that will be stabilized gravel, also permeable. So as I said before, the whole both side yards are are completely permeable. And in the case of the the side yard shared with pearls, the 185 Pearl Street neighbor, there&#39;s also plantings there. So we feel that we&#39;ve designed a kind of buffer, a landscape buffer, although it does not Christopher McConkey, meet the last requirement of the in particular of the the landscape buffer zoning ordinance which states that you cannot have parking. Christopher McConkey, In your landscape buffer and so allowing the neighbor at for data street to keep their parking space violates that. Christopher McConkey, That point of the zoning ordinance and I just would like to quickly read through our responses to the criteria, because I think that. um that is what we&#39;re obligated to to show in order to to receive a hardship variance from this board is that we meet these three criteria and I think that we&#39;ve clearly set out in this narrative um uh how we&#39;re meeting those so if you all bear with me I&#39;ll just quickly read through this so as it relates to point a special circumstances exist relating to the parcel um As we just stated, the neighboring driveway at Fort Dana Street is using part of the property at 181 Pearl Street as a driveway. The driveway encroachment is 3 feet 6 inches wide along the entire northern lot line. Additionally, 181 Pearl Street is a small corner MR3 parcel at 2,024 square feet is less than one-third the size of an average MR3 parcel. It is abutted on each side by NR parcels. A 10-foot side setback is required per SCO for any building in the MR3 district, one to the butts NR. A 12-foot curb setback is required at the primary and secondary fronts of the building. And these proportionally large, keyword being proportionally here to this small site, proportionally large setbacks on all four sides leave a very small developable area. those are the special circumstances point b literal enforcement of the provision of this ordinance for the district with the subject land or structures located would involve substantial hardship financial or otherwise the proposed project allows the neighbor to keep their driveway as a gesture of goodwill seo section 10.3.6.b.8 prohibits surface parking within the landscape buffer literal enforcement of the ordinance would require taking the neighboring property&#39;s driveway back into the possession of 181 pearl street this is likely to create a legal battle which would be a financial hardship and would also create a contentious relationship with the neighbor another hardship and as pablo said he was clear from the beginning that he does not want that kind of contentious relationship uh point c desirable relief could be granted without causing substantial detriment to the public good and without nullifying or substantially derogating from the intent and purpose of a specific district in this ordinance granting relief on the landscape buffers does not cause detriment to the public good the proposed landscape design including plantings and the perimeter brick wall that runs along the west and north lot lines has been thoughtfully designed to provide screening via visual amenity and meet the requirements of the green score John Potter, and to provide a buffer between the site and the abutting neighbors neighbors we believe this design meets the intent of the zoning ordinance and the specific goals of the Mr three district.</td>
