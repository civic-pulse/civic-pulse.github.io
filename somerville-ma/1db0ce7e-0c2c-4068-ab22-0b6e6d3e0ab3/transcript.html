First, pursuant to our rule 32, let it be known that this City Council salutes the flag of the United States of America, and let us recall our oath to uphold the Constitution and the laws of the Commonwealth to the best of our abilities and understanding. Councillor McLaughlin is attending a big family event this evening, and Councillor Mbah is in New York City for UN Climate Week. They both send their regrets and will follow up. I wanted to note that since Councillor Mbah serves as the Vice President, to the extent that I need to step down and speak to any issue, as the next most senior in age, Councillor Scott, according to our rules, would sever the place. So if he steps up, that&#39;s why we&#39;re doing it that way. Good? OK. All right, we begin our meetings with a moment of silence. Are there any councillors wishing to say a few words about members of our community tonight? All right, seeing none, would anyone in the chambers please rise as you are able for a moment of silence? Thank you. All right, Madam Clerk, first item.</td>

                <td> So Mr. President, through you, as I was saying, it is my honor to bring forward this citation. Myself and other, and Councillor Strezo were reached out to by actually, it was a joint effort between the mayor&#39;s office. We all wanted to make sure that the firefighters of Somerville were recognized for the heroics on the day of July 6th. So I&#39;m gonna read a little recap of that day. I&#39;m gonna read the citation and... So let me just begin by saying I was on the scene that day, as was Councillor Wilson, and on that afternoon of Sunday, July 6th, during a severe heat advisory, a devastating fire broke out on the third floor of a triple-decker on Wheatland Street. The blaze spread quickly, and despite the best efforts of tenants and neighbors, soon engulfed much of the building. The fire&#39;s intensity forced the evacuation of not only the triple-decker, but also the adjacent property, leaving a total of 27 Somerville residents displaced. Somerville Fire Department units arrived within minutes of the alarm and immediately went to work under dangerous and exhausting conditions, battling both the blaze and extreme heat. Firefighters acted with speed, precision, and courage, aggressively working to contain the fire and prevent further loss. Their response was supported by multiple companies called to the scene, coordinating seamlessly to protect lives, neighboring homes, and the community as a whole. The incident did draw a large crowd of onlookers, many of whom witnessed firsthand the bravery and professionalism of the Somerville Fire Department. In the face of chaos, our firefighters demonstrated the highest level of dedication to public safety, reminding us of the extraordinary commitment they bring to their work every single day. We honor the men and women of the Sunwell Fire Department not only for their actions on Wheatland Street, but for the tireless service they provide to our city. Thanks to their courage and skill, an even greater tragedy was averted, and our community is deeply grateful. now i just want to add that that was my first in experience like i said this was a joint effort because we had a number of fires around the city including one in ward seven uh who which is why council Strezo wanted to make sure that there was recognition but of course i mean i know we all appreciate the efforts of our fire department and uh there was just it was just a bad fire uh excuse me summer for fires and uh and our uh firefighters responded accordingly every single time making sure that loss was at a minimum, and just putting themselves out there in harm&#39;s way. As I said, I was on the scene of the Wheatland Street Fire, and it was a very chaotic scene. I do want to say that we as a community really didn&#39;t know how to come together. regular citizens, making sure that all the firefighters had water. I mean, this was a community effort, but it was led by the bravery of the men and women of the Somerville Fire Department, making sure that they saved a cat. I mean, there was multiple amazing deeds done that day. So we wanted to make sure that for the summer and just in general, and certainly for the Wheatland Street, Thurston Street, and the town of the housing in Clarendon Hill, that we recognized the firefighters of Somerville for their bravery and their commitment to our community. So that said, I&#39;m gonna read the citation. I don&#39;t, unless, should I let colleagues speak first or should we just go right to the citation? Okay, all right. So, citation reads as follows. Somerville, be it hereby known to all that the City of Somerville, I&#39;m sorry, that the Somerville City Council and the Mayor offer their sincerest commendations to the Somerville firefighters. for the heroic actions in summer 2025 providing swift and life-saving response to protect life and property in large fires on wheatland street powderhouse avenue and thurston street offered this 25th day of september 2025 signed by the entire council and her madam mayor and with that i&#39;d like to present this to the president of the union whoever would like to step forward please and or all of you if you want to</td>

Unfortunately, the mayor is ill today and could not be here, but she wanted to make sure I came up here and said on her behalf, thank you to all the firefighters. Really grateful for the efforts over the course of the summer and the bravery displayed. It&#39;s part of what makes our community so lovely, as the Councillor said. So many people coming together, all of our staff and our wonderful firefighters. So thank you on behalf of Mayor Ballantyne.</td>

So what the traffic patterns, because mobility should be discussing this as well, I believe. So last month, a semi-truck, I mean, this is a CVS semi-truck that was about to make deliveries in Davis Square, took a shortcut through a very, very tiny side street. And along the way, along the side street tiny turn, which a semi truck can&#39;t do on a tiny street, took out an electric pole and the electricity of the neighborhood. And I&#39;m sure you colleagues, you all knew about this, because we&#39;ve all heard about it. And so what we&#39;ve ascertained through all this is that the semi truck was using a different traffic pattern, of course, was going down Broadway. and not going the main street road that you would assume it would take to make a delivery of a semi-truck amount of delivery to Davis Square. And there are numerous impacts on this, including the fact that the residents have to pay out of their own money to get things back in line and back in service and their electricity and things back up, and that&#39;s going to be an ongoing situation for them. So the impact of the neighborhood is still going to happen and I&#39;d like to discuss this to just send it on to committee So public utilities Public Works It&#39;s all right All right.</td>

I&#39;m not saying this is a situation in this in but on my street, one of the garbage trucks that go down my street every single week, all of a sudden, one day, grabbed onto one of the wires. That hadn&#39;t been changed, nothing had happened except I believe the wind had sort of stretched them out just enough that it snagged the truck. So just something for everybody to be mindful of that these wires do, you know, they can, become lowered on their own through wear and tear of wind and other natural forces. But nonetheless, it ripped the pole right off my landlady&#39;s house. And we didn&#39;t lose power luckily, but it&#39;s just one of those things that I feel for those people that we were lucky in that situation, but certainly trucks coming down our streets and low hanging wires are a bad combination. So happy to talk about it in committee. Thank you.</td>

If not, anything that was submitted would expire anyways and we&#39;d need to resubmit something.

                <td>Mr. President, the Finance Committee met on Tuesday, September 23rd with four of five members present. We took up a 23-item agenda over a 55-minute meeting. In addition to the minutes from our September 9th meeting, we recommended that you approve tonight a $50,000 grant for OSE, six pretty small dollar figure prior to your invoice items. two related infrastructure and asset management items, a $4.3 million bond for the Morrison Avenue storage sewer separation project, that&#39;s an important one, the extension of a contract with Eastern Bank for banking services, and four legal items related to 299 Broadway that hopefully pave the way to a start on the work there here this fall. We then talked about the update that we received on two of Councillor Burnley&#39;s items on UASI grants and strings that have been attached to those by the federal government. In a nutshell, we&#39;re still in wait and see mode with the state about some parts of that, but the committee members were united in agreement that our values are not negotiable, and that we should be absolutely clear with the public that any recent approval of UASI grants have come from prior fiscal years, and therefore they did not have any of those problematic requirements attached to them. So we did keep those two items in committee just for further updates since it is still a fluid situation. And finally, we got the requested report from the Director of Finance on stabilization funds, but we kept that order in committee as well just so its originator, Councilor Mabau, could participate in the discussion. So I&#39;ll ask the committee report be accepted as submitted.</td>

                <td>Thank you. I just wanted to go a little bit more in depth on the UASI grant items that I submitted that we discussed. The council received a memo from law regarding where we currently stand on those. Essentially, the federal administration has added new national priorities that potentially could require pending litigation, Illinois v. FEMA. require communities that take these federal grants to put at least 10% of that money toward cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. I wanted to ensure that we were not obligated to do that, which we are not thus far. As I mentioned before, there is federal litigation pending to determine whether that leveraging is legally viable. to if it turns out that it is, there&#39;s a couple of different pathways forward. I mean, there&#39;s three acceptable ways to comply with that, one of which is through information sharing, which through BRIC, the Boston Regional Intelligence Center, which the city is already participating in, potentially could already be, you know, satisfy those requirements kazuntite although you know which is not to say frankly that information sharing through brick is harmless either but i just want to make it very clear that if if these funds are requiring our community to violate our own sanctuary city laws um is that is a conversation that this council should take very seriously um and determine through the ministry with the administration what our strategy for that will be and that&#39;s a conversation that should include the council the administration rjpoc and be holistic about what information sharing we&#39;re already doing and what would be required under these new in positions from the federal administration. So just to be clear, it&#39;s not happening yet. I imagine that we will get an answer on this relatively soon. So just wanna put that out there.</td>

It&#39;s not safe for driving, walking, or cycles. Several years ago, we got close to having quick build. But my understanding, there were just kind of capacity issues of actually getting that implemented. There have been accidents recently, and I think we just really want to light a fire under this. We can&#39;t wait until we&#39;re ready to do the proper final reconfiguration of this. We need to get safety infrastructure in there really as soon as possible.</td>

And I know that my colleagues on the council have also been uh carrying this load along with me is the word three counselor so uh there is now a crossing guard there there are flex posts there is a no left turn coming out of the high school all of those are major improvements and yet it is still really really really dangerous the traffic is just extremely bad in the morning and the and the evening and when school is being let out and i can&#39;t really think of a solution except some kind of light there, whether that&#39;s the thing where people press the button and it blinks yellow, or whether that&#39;s a hawk signal, or whether we could actually get in a button-activated red light that truly stops traffic. It&#39;s just, you know, every day I think there are near misses, and occasionally, as we know, there are also not misses. You know, people have been hit there. So I&#39;d ask that this please go to traffic and parking as well. Okay. Councilor Schezo?</td>

                <td> Thank you. Yes, I believe that I spent over, what, a year talking about trying to get a crossing guard on this very intersection, and I&#39;m very grateful that a crossing guard, yes, is there now. There was a temporary crossing guard, and it looks like there&#39;s a more permanent crossing guard there. One thing that can be helpful if anybody has actually, like, Seen the intersection in primetime when this is happening when school is happening There is bumper-to-bumper traffic all the way up and down Highland Avenue and it is very much like Frogger and Teenagers being teenagers don&#39;t always cross at the crosswalk that is painted they often cross at the part of the other side of vinyl and Going toward the high school that doesn&#39;t have the crosswalk so teenagers are coming from or maybe not just teenagers Pedestrians all pedestrians sometimes are just crossing at both ends of that one thing that I do think would be helpful is lowering the no turning left signs because I&#39;ve heard from constituents that they don&#39;t see the The no turn left sign. So I think affixing the no turn left sign to the actual stop sign could help because visually to the eye There&#39;s about 20 different things that you can look at the same time and in the construction happening with the with the memorial The veteran memorials that with the fenced off area. There&#39;s a lot to view at the same time So I do think lowering the signs will help But it is a bumper-to-bumper traffic area presently. And additionally, I think what could be helpful is at second crosswalk, at least acknowledging that people are still going to come from both sides to cross.</td>

                <td>Councillor Clingan. Thank you, Mr. President, through you. All members were present. of both the school committee and the city council. A number of items were discussed. There were some great memos attached to the agenda. I&#39;ll just go through a few highlights. The items regarding the pool, there was a few, there was three. So Chief of Staff Spencer has been working with Parks and Rec to address the pool issues. Also with the contractor that we use, there was a recommendation that the pool will be closed one day a week, or they&#39;re proposing the pool be closed one day a week to allow for necessary adjustments and maintenance. The day of closure is still being determined to minimize disruption. Director of Operations Yanni Sigridis is exploring options to expand weekend hours to make up for that day. The memo also outlined updates to lifeguard manual, including new procedures for testing pool chemicals, Chief of Staff Spencer also addressed the chemical spill in June caused by human error while refilling a tank of muriatic acid. The Department of Public Works has since installed a shutoff valve on the water hose to reduce the risk of leaks. You know, we had the Director of Emergency Management there who also was able to weigh in, who has really been kind of hands-on on a lot of different types of issues. Of course, that issue, a memo did go, you know, an email did go out to parents saying that there was a essentially a chemical spill which wasn&#39;t totally inaccurate all the necessary precautions were taken to make sure that student safety was put first and foremost so there was no fooling around with oh you know how bad is this or it was handled um very seriously with regards to um you know it being chemicals and all so um the pool is somewhat of a work in progress. There&#39;s a lot of attention being paid to it. Like I said, they may or may not. They&#39;re looking at closing one day and expanding hours on the weekend. The other issue was regarding a contingency plan. If a school building wants to go down, There is a great memo, I mean, it&#39;s a plan. It may not be an awesome plan, but it&#39;s a plan, and the plan would be that the TAB building, all the staff in the TAB building that&#39;s currently there, would be moved out, and that would be made into a school, which it already is set up for as a school. So there you have it. I don&#39;t know if they&#39;d go to, you know, if everybody&#39;s not working from home, or if people would go back to certain areas like the annex, but we asked for an emergency plan, and one was, So that would handle that. A few of the other issues, items we kept in committee had to do with, with a plan to accommodate several public school students to mitigate disruption to students, families, and staff if a school building is unavailable. A lot of those items are being discussed as part of an MOU with the school committee. So we kept those in committee until the MOU is completed. And... That&#39;s it, I ask that this report be accepted as submitted. Actually, I&#39;m sorry, there&#39;s a great update also if anyone watches the video on the MSPA process and where we are and there&#39;s a great timeline attached. The Mayor&#39;s Office did do a great job of putting together a really visual and nicely laid out timeline. I ask that this report be accepted as submitted, thank you.</td>

Or if there&#39;s a timeliness to it being approved, then it&#39;s appropriate for a supplemental item. If not, we don&#39;t want to take any, I&#39;m going to encourage that we don&#39;t take any actions on items that were in the supplemental agenda. In this case, if we&#39;re referring these to committee, then they will be properly noticed on a committee report. The public can see and read them, so no objection there. From my standpoint, assuming that that&#39;s the direction we&#39;ll end up going, then that&#39;s going to be our approach, just as a reminder. I still would like to generally sort of move away from the practice, but certainly with this topic, I would imagine there&#39;s always a degree of urgency. And so, as I said, no objection, but I will recommend that these go to committee just so they can be properly noticed before we dispose of them in one way or the other. We have the attachment up?

Through the Chair, as the first item notes, My goal is for there to be a discussion on these items with the director of Office of Immigrant Affairs, who I have at least briefly discussed this idea with. There&#39;s another one in English of what we&#39;re seeing on the screen as well, but these are images of Know Your Rights mailers that were sent out to every household in Providence, Rhode Island earlier this year, back in June, as an attempt to equip their residents with the necessary knowledge to protect their constitutional rights. Those rights are changing by the day, it seems, and quite... They feel under attack, frankly. I think it&#39;s really important that every member of our community feels equipped with this knowledge, that they know the best practices as to what they&#39;re allowed to do, how they&#39;re allowed to respond if federal agents ask them questions stop them as has been the case in somerville far too often as of late and that they know what their rights are when they see such actions happening in our community these examples from rhode island from providence are In English and in Spanish, they contain some information about people&#39;s rights. They even, if you look in the bottom left-hand corner, contain a portion of the document that can be cut out and slid under a door in case there is someone on the other side of that door who a community member does not want to let into their home or isn&#39;t worried may deprive them of their rights. including their right to due process. I&#39;ve been making some noise about this for a while now. I think it&#39;s really important that we try to make sure that every person in our community is aware of their rights and I think the best way to do that would be through a citywide mailing to every household as was done in Providence. Now the content of that mailing I think is very debatable, what should be in there, what would be most helpful, what information should not be in there. I would love for this council to discuss that with our Office of Immigrant Affairs so that they and some of their, with their legal and personal experience can help advise us on what that would be. And I&#39;ve been told thus far that, you know, could be a good idea. Let&#39;s get communications in here as well. So I want to send this off to committee, want there to be a good conversation about it, but I think it&#39;s important that there is an allocation for this effort within FY26. Thank you.</td>
