<h3 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h3>
<p>The City Council convened a special meeting to address three key financial appropriations. The primary items included funding a collective bargaining agreement for the Somerville Police Superior Officers Association, approving a memorandum of agreement for Service Employees International Union Local 3 school custodians based on a recent wage study, and authorizing payment for prior year arbitration invoices for Human Resources. All three items were approved by a unanimous vote of the councilors present.</p>
<h3 id="agenda-item-71-request-for-appropriation-for-somerville-police-superior-officers-association-collective-bargaining-agreement">Agenda Item 7.1: Request for Appropriation for Somerville Police Superior Officers Association Collective Bargaining Agreement</h3>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> A request from the Mayor for the appropriation of $654,019 from the salary contingency account to various police department personal services accounts. This funding is intended to cover the costs associated with a collective bargaining agreement with the Somerville Police Superior Officers Association.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion:</strong>
*   Matt Sergue, Labor Counsel, presented the item, noting that the agreement is a successor contract for fiscal years 2022 to 2024.
*   The contract mirrors the previously approved patrol contract and includes:
    *   2% Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA) in the first year.
    *   3% COLAs in the second and third years.
    *   2% market adjustments in each year of the contract.
    *   Civilian detail language, which is crucial for implementing the civilian detail program.
    *   A slight increase to hazardous duty pay.
    *   An increase to the detail rate for sworn officers.
*   No questions were raised by the Council.</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong>
*   <strong>Motion:</strong> Councilor Mbah moved for approval.
*   <strong>Outcome:</strong> Approved as part of a consolidated vote (see below).</p>
<h3 id="agenda-item-72-request-for-appropriation-for-service-employees-international-union-local-3-school-custodians-memorandum-of-agreement">Agenda Item 7.2: Request for Appropriation for Service Employees International Union Local 3 School Custodians Memorandum of Agreement</h3>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> A request from the Mayor for the appropriation of $77,400 from the salary contingency account to the Department of Public Works school custodian's salaries account. This funding is for a memorandum of agreement with Service Employees International Union Local 3 school custodians.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion:</strong>
*   Matt Sergue, Labor Counsel, explained that this agreement stems from a wage re-opener provision in the custodians' previous contract (FY23-FY25), which allowed for renegotiation after the completion of the city's wage and compensation study.
*   The wage study indicated that while starting salaries were competitive, there was compression in the salary scale, particularly at the top end.
*   The memorandum of agreement includes:
    *   A 2% market adjustment added to all steps of the salary scale in fiscal year 2025.
    *   An additional 2% market adjustment for Step 10 (the top step) in fiscal year 2025, resulting in a total 4% market adjustment for this step.
    *   A structural adjustment effective June 30, 2025, to recalibrate the wage scale to include 2% steps instead of 1% steps, addressing salary compression and aligning with the Somerville Municipal Employees Union (SMEU) building custodians' scale.
*   No questions were raised by the Council.</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong>
*   <strong>Motion:</strong> Councilor Mbah moved for approval.
*   <strong>Outcome:</strong> Approved as part of a consolidated vote (see below).</p>
<h3 id="agenda-item-73-request-for-approval-to-pay-prior-year-invoices-for-arbitration-services">Agenda Item 7.3: Request for Approval to Pay Prior Year Invoices for Arbitration Services</h3>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> A request from the Mayor for approval to pay prior year invoices totaling $375 using available funds in the Human Resources, Professional and Technical Services account for arbitration services.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion:</strong>
*   Anne Gill, Director of Human Resources, clarified that the invoices were for services rendered in June 2024 but were not received until 2025.
*   The delay was attributed to a transition period between the Human Resources and Law Departments, with the Law Department now responsible for paying these invoices going forward.
*   No questions were raised by the Council.</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong>
*   <strong>Motion:</strong> Councilor Mbah moved for approval.
*   <strong>Outcome:</strong> Approved as part of a consolidated vote (see below).</p>
