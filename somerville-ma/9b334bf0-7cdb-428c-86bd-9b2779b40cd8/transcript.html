I&#39;ll just start by saying for meeting, for calling this special meeting or agreeing to meet during the recess. I know the administration and the affected unions certainly appreciate it. So thank you. So this item is to fund the cost items in the Somerville Police Superior Officers Association memorandum of agreement for a successor contract for fiscal years 2022 to 2024. This contract mirrors the patrol contract that the council approved in May of this year. It has, as its highlights, 2% COLA in the first year and 3% COLAs in the second two years. along with 2% market adjustments in each year of the contract. It also includes the civilian detail language from the police patrol contract, which now gives us kind of the second piece of the puzzle in terms of our bargaining obligations to roll out that program. We&#39;re all excited, I think, to get it in patrol, but we, of course, need it in superiors as well. So we have that now. There&#39;s also a slight bump to hazardous duty and a bump to the detail rate for sworn officers. With that, I will, those are the highlights, and I&#39;m happy to answer any questions that the council has. Okay, thank you. Are there any questions?</td>

                <td> yes thank you again council president through you so this is kind of a more this is a unique contract so in the school custodian&#39;s last contract that was for fiscal years 23 to fiscal year 25 we included a wage re-opener provision because this group was willing to settle that contract with certain colas we negotiated while the wage study was still pending provided we agreed to reopen wage negotiations once the wage study was completed. So now that the city&#39;s wage and compensation study has completed, we went back to this group, shared the results with them, talked about what it revealed, and came up with this memorandum of agreement. what this essentially says what the wage study at a high level suggested was that our um our starting salary was competitive but there was a bit of compression with the salary scale with this group and that the top end uh had some more room for improvement so there&#39;s a two percent uh in fiscal year 25 there&#39;s a two percent uh market adjustment added to all steps of the salary scale And then for the top step, the step 10, there&#39;s an additional 2% added to that, making for a 4% total market adjustment in fiscal year 25 for these folks. As well, structurally, we sought to adjust what the study revealed as well by effective June 30th, 2025. recalibrating the wage scale for this group so that going forward, there&#39;s a permanent adjustment so that there are 2% steps in this scale instead of the 1% steps. And that&#39;s designed to address, again, the point about compression in the scale and there perhaps being the top end of our scale being lower than some of our peers and what was calibrated for the SMEU building custodians. That was our internal comparator there. Yeah. So if there&#39;s any questions, I&#39;m happy to answer them.</td>
