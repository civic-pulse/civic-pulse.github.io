*   <strong>Second:</strong> Zachary Zaremba

<p><strong>2. 8-8A Melvin Street (Continued from July 16, 2025)</strong>
*   <strong>Applicant:</strong> Rob Passione, Architect, and the homeowner.
*   <strong>Background:</strong> The application involves dormer modifications that resulted in three zoning code violations. The Board previously indicated that the original configuration would not be approved.
*   <strong>Proposed Changes:</strong> The applicant proposes shifting the dormer wall by 35 inches, reducing the dormer width from 16 feet to 13 feet 1 inch. This change is believed to bring the dormer ridge length into compliance with the 50% rule.
*   <strong>Remaining Violations:</strong>
    *   Dormer separation (currently 4 feet 10 inches, still over the limit).
    *   Window ratio with the side wall being over 36 inches.
*   <strong>Public Comment:</strong>
    *   <strong>Speaker:</strong> Mr. Porter (name not fully transcribed)
    *   <strong>Summary:</strong> Mr. Porter questioned how the project meets the first condition for a hardship variance, specifically regarding a compelling condition related to the building.
    *   <strong>Direct Quote:</strong> "I'm just curious about how this might meet the first condition for a hardship variance after looking at the analysis in the staff report regarding that as to whether there's some compelling condition relating to the building. And how it could be that it would be necessary to, to construct this in this way."
    *   <strong>Staff Response (Madison Anthony):</strong> Stated that there is nothing about the site that gives it special circumstances to qualify for a hardship.
*   <strong>Board Discussion:</strong>
    *   <strong>Ann Fullerton:</strong> Acknowledged the substantial change in removing one hardship request but continued to struggle with the first criterion for a hardship variance. Noted the Board's past willingness to work with residents making good-faith changes.
    *   <strong>Zachary Zaremba:</strong> Agreed with Ann Fullerton, noting significant changes and the applicant's good faith.
    *   <strong>Susan Fontano:</strong> Expressed concern about the frequency of "oops, we made a mistake" situations and the need for applicants to adhere to rules from the beginning. Suggested the current proposal could be further modified.
    *   <strong>Sisia Daglian:</strong> Found the "unbalanced windows" odd and suggested removing the left-hand window. Questioned why the dormer couldn't be slimmed further, potentially impacting the kitchen island, but noted that extensive work is already underway. Suggested making the windows conforming.
    *   <strong>Brian Cook:</strong> Expressed difficulty in stretching Criterion 1 and Criterion 2 of the hardship variance criteria to fit this situation. Noted that the rationale provided (difficulty in building a market-rate kitchen due to a steep roof slope) is a design problem, not a zoning problem. Agreed that Criterion 3 (no significant detriment) is met, but the other two are problematic.
    *   <strong>Applicant Response (Homeowner):</strong> Explained that construction occurred during COVID-19, making oversight difficult. Stated that they have done everything possible to comply without completely reconfiguring the kitchen. Emphasized the financial hardship of being unable to sell units due to the ongoing situation.
    *   <strong>Applicant Response (Rob Passione):</strong> Clarified that the original design aimed for a "market rate kitchen" in a third-floor unit, which necessitated the dormer size. Acknowledged that site conditions are not typically a hardship justification but presented this as a unique challenge.
    *   <strong>Ann Fullerton:</strong> Asked for pictures of the existing kitchen, specifically the refrigerator wall, to assess potential alternative layouts. Suggested that a 12-foot dormer might be achievable by rearranging the kitchen, even if less generous.
    *   <strong>Zachary Zaremba:</strong> Requested clearer justification from the applicant regarding how the first condition (irregularity of the lot or building) for a hardship variance is satisfied, potentially with more documentation or drawings.
    *   <strong>Susan Fontano:</strong> Recommended providing pictures of both the interior and exterior to illustrate how internal modifications could address external zoning compliance.
    *   <strong>Brian Cook:</strong> Suggested that demonstrating an "unusual nature of the structure" that limits further redesign could help the Board accept the justification for remaining variances.
*   <strong>Applicant Request:</strong> The applicant requested a continuance to further brainstorm and provide additional documentation, including pictures and a clearer justification for the hardship variance criteria. The applicant also inquired about obtaining a Certificate of Occupancy for Unit 2, which the Board clarified is under the purview of Inspectional Services, not the ZBA.
*   <strong>Submission Deadline:</strong> Madison Anthony suggested a submission deadline of noon on September 10 for materials related to the September 17 meeting.
*   <strong>Motion:</strong> Brian Cook moved to approve the request for a continuance to the September 17, 2025, Zoning Board of Appeals meeting in the matter of 8-8A Melvin Street.
*   <strong>Second:</strong> Ann Fullerton
*   <strong>Vote:</strong>
    *   Ann Fullerton: Aye
    *   Brian Cook: Aye
    *   Sisia Daglian: Aye
    *   Zachary Zaremba: Aye
    *   Susan Fontano: Aye
*   <strong>Outcome:</strong> The motion passed unanimously (5-0). The application is continued to September 17, 2025.</p>
