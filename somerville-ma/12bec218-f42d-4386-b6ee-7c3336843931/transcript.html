                <td> Oh, excellent. All right. Thank you so much. So my name is Devon Herrick. I&#39;m a wetland scientist with Weston and Sampson. I&#39;m here today to speak with you about the Draw 7 Park project. We&#39;ve recently undergone quite an extensive permitting process, and this project is underway. I will say that I&#39;m an environmental permitter, so I&#39;m afraid if you have design questions, I may not be able to answer them, but I will certainly do my darndest to answer any questions that you may have. To give you a little orientation, the Draw 7 Park is located right next to Assembly Row and it is adjacent to the Amelia Earhart Dam. If you&#39;re familiar with that, it is located right where my cursor is. Plans to improve this park include updated site amenities, utilities, pedestrian connectivity. The project&#39;s also looking to address some flooding issues with the river systems that are located adjacent. This will include the development of a flood barrier that&#39;s through a natural berm, as well as creation of a living shoreline to mitigate some of the riverbank erosion that&#39;s occurring on that park&#39;s eastern side. And in general, just the project is serving to increase community access with the goal of connection to the Mystic River Reservation Greenway. From an environmental perspective, the site is quite interesting because it is at the confluence of tidal and non-tidal resources. On the downstream side of the dam, we&#39;ve got tidal resources and upstream non-tidal. When it&#39;s completed, so right now what you see in front of you is the existing conditions in the park. So it&#39;s basically wide open space. You may be familiar with the fishing pier that&#39;s present. That will remain. It&#39;s actually going to be improved upon. And there&#39;s a small parking area. So let me see if I can shift. This is what the proposed conditions are due to look like. So we&#39;re looking at a variety of open lawn spaces, flexible seating, accessible pathways, shade structure, improved parking facilities, a very extensive planting plan, which I can show you on this page here. And like I said, those improvements to the shoreline and the fishing pier. So the reason I&#39;m before you here today is the last permit that we have from an environmental perspective is what&#39;s called Chapter 91. For folks that may be not so familiar with this particular permit, Chapter 91 is known as the Public Waterfront Act. It&#39;s one of the oldest pieces of environmental legislation in the country. And they particularly protect, in this case, filled tidelands and flowed tidelands. So the Mystic River adjacent to the site is a flowed tideland, meaning subject to tidal action. And part of this project is seeking to do beach cleanup and beach nourishment. So on the beach right now, there&#39;s debris in the form of bricks, glass, concrete. things along those lines. So what we&#39;re looking to do is get that cleaned up and then come back and augment the entirety of the beach area with a matching grain size material. So it&#39;s beach nourishment. We&#39;re just kind of going to be adding a thin layer of material, maximum of three inches deep, just to make the area smooth and to make sure that it&#39;s accessible for everyone. We&#39;re looking at adding approximately 397 cubic yards of material. So as part of this chapter 91 process, we need both a planning signature and a zoning signature. It&#39;s just kind of part of the standard process, just indicating that you&#39;re aware of the project and understand what&#39;s going on. Planning was kind enough to have us at their latest meeting. And so now I&#39;m here before you and I would be happy to do my darndest to answer any questions that you may have about the project.</td>

So if we are looking here on the left hand side of the screen, as you enter, we&#39;re going to have a newly configured parking area. with some nice wide accessible pathways. There&#39;s gonna be a seating area here with a nice shade structure. Those pathways will continue including pathways along the water to increase waterfront kind of access. And so people can be looking at the really lovely view that you folks have. Improved access up to this fishing pier. The fishing pier will stay the same in the same configuration, but access to the pier will be improved. This giant oval is a large circular lawn space. And it&#39;s surrounded by some of these lighter gray areas that you may be able to see are more like naturalized plantings. A little bit longer grass. It&#39;s supposed to be a bit more natural areas as opposed to manicured lawn, which is more what we&#39;re looking at in this oval. Those pathways continue up to this circular pathway here and another circular pathway here before connecting offsite into that existing pathway that you already have.</td>

                <td>Rob Passione, Alright, so um. Let me share my PDF here so everyone can see that. So just to quickly recap, what we had submitted last time was a dormer at this kitchen area here on the third floor of the building. It&#39;s a 16 foot wide dorm which had three zoning code violations. The feedback we got from the board was that at this configuration would not be approved. So we went back and we discussed it and we had our contractor come down to the site to take a look at it to see what we could do to try to modify it and kind of what the steps would be to make that happen. So what we&#39;re proposing tonight for the board&#39;s consideration is to shift the dormer wall on this side So in the plan, the left side over 35 inches, which would essentially drop the dormer with down to 13 foot one inches from, from 16 foot. Um, or the originally original approved drawings had an 11 foot seven. So it&#39;s one foot six above, above where it was originally approved. Um, so what we would do is essentially slide this wall over. We would have to, you know, basically modify all of these cabinets here, modify the side of the kitchen Island. But we would propose for the board&#39;s consideration to keep the windows where they are. So basically push it over as far as we could to get as close as we could to the existing windows that are in the dormer now. One thing we did note that when we resubmitted the paperwork that the 50% of the dormer ridge, the new dormer is not going over 50% of the total dormer ridge length. We actually believe we meet that requirement now by sliding this over 35 inches. But the other two items that we are still in violation of would be the dormer separation, which went from one foot 11 inches to four foot 10 inches. We&#39;re still over on that one. And then the window ratio with the sod wall being over 36 inches. So we&#39;ve been over on that one as well. But hopefully this improves the situation and happy to answer any questions or hear what you guys think.</td>

We&#39;ve got to figure out how we get the word out there to these people, whether it be a small person that wants to buy something and flip it and do it over, and then we work with the contractors or the architects. And they take things upon themselves or they walk away from something and everybody does their own thing. And then they come back and it&#39;s like, oops, we made a mistake. I always say, we&#39;re not here to say no. We want people to improve their properties and prosper and businesses and for residential or business. But, you know, we&#39;ve got to really start really taking a look at these things, because as we go down the road, it&#39;s not fair to other people who really play by the rules and would never think of doing such a thing like this. They would have done it right from the beginning, not to have to go and hear it out and what have you. So having said that, I would have thought they would have gone try and been smaller. I try to modify it a little better. Anybody else have anything to say? Or does the architect have anything to say?</td>

I think the last time when we were looking at the building sections of the kitchen, you know, it seemed like the fridge could actually tuck under the existing roof. So I&#39;m not sure why the dorm can&#39;t get more can&#39;t slim up even more other than perhaps it&#39;s going to affect the dimension of the island. But you&#39;re already there doing all this work. So I think having the windows be conforming is not, I mean, everything is extra work at this point, but it&#39;s not unreasonable to ask that at least that be conforming.</td>

If you&#39;re there tearing things up, you could make the whole thing conforming. It would have impact to, you know, the kitchen a little bit, or perhaps to the island. But I don&#39;t know.

Since the two hardship variances that remain are for the dormer face width and the dormer separation standards, if more adjustments can&#39;t be made to bring those into further, closer to compliance, I don&#39;t know what to do. As it is, it&#39;s really hard to stretch criterion one and criterion two of the hardship variance criteria to fit a situation like this. I mean, we, you know, we have the discretion. We can do a lot with those criteria, but this is essentially trying to create a justification based on a set of decisions that were made that have nothing to do really with I mean there is some uh there are some remarks in the applicant&#39;s submission to suggest that it was the nature of the building itself that forced the design of the dormers in order to allow there to be a kitchen for there to be a full third floor apartment um I mean I If that then leads to a zoning violation, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s something that we can reasonably respond to. It&#39;s unfortunate that you have a building with a steep slope in the roof and that you have to raise it with the dormer in order to get a third floor apartment in there with a kitchen. um but that&#39;s really a problem of design and not a problem of zoning and if you can&#39;t meet the zoning requirements too we&#39;re stuck I mean we really are faced with this and cystic was all done this is you know this is as built that needs to be some um reconstruction um I&#39;m having a hard time accepting what the findings for the criteria would be. I agree with criteria three that there&#39;s really no significant detriment to the neighborhood, the public good, the zoning ordinance for this. But the other two, I have a hard time finding the language in the findings that will make it palatable to the board&#39;s positive vote.</td>

And it&#39;s definitely I was a novice in this project, I should have done better. And no question about that. But in all good faith, we did go back and work on this. And without totally taking out the kitchen and moving it back to the other side, as in the original plans, we have done everything we can to comply. We, in fact, got one hardship variance removed and we have only two remaining. And even there, the variance we are seeking on the dhamma width has been reduced. The issue has been reduced. I don&#39;t know what more we can do to keep the kitchen where it is and go forward. I&#39;ve been struggling with this. For one year, I&#39;ve been stuck in this situation, not being able to sell unit two or unit three and not being able to make any progress. It is definitely hurting me financially tremendously. That&#39;s all I have to say. And Rob had something else he wanted to share.</td>

                <td>Yeah, so I understand what you guys are saying about the site conditions obviously are not really a factor here. Our way of trying to address that was to say the existing structure, it was difficult to put a kitchen up there. And we had originally designed it where there was the... The headroom issue, so the contractor had took it upon himself to switch it to the other side. And in order to get a, what we would call market rate kitchen in there, that is why they made the dorm room as big as they did. Now we&#39;re obviously shrinking it down. So we need to get a smaller kitchen, but the justification for it was to say, Hey, this is, you know, to meet kind of the standards of the neighborhood of what we would expect in Somerville for a third floor unit. We thought that the dormer needed to be this big. So that was kind of a hardship justification. So I know that&#39;s probably a little more out of the box than you guys are used to hearing. I know state conditions is a common thing that comes up with hardship. But that was kind of what we tried to lay out in our findings.</td>

But that was a decision that the owner and then the original architect, perhaps, and then the contractor made. And you&#39;re asking us to create a justification, which is that there was something wrong with the structure, that justifies the hardship variance. So that&#39;s what we&#39;re wrestling with.

So, PB, Harmon Zuckerman, I I I apologize because this is going to come off as Monday morning quarterbacking, but I do think there is a path that is possible with the existing kitchen where it is, meaning with the sink in its existing place, the dishwasher in its existing place, and the range in its existing place by just eliminating the cabinetry on the refrigerator wall and potentially, as Member Deglan suggested, tucking the refrigerator in into the eve, so it would just have drywall next to it it&#39;s certainly not ideal and you&#39;d have to relocate windows possibly put the the division, the mold division between windows on the Center of the sink to. to make it so you don&#39;t need a variance for the window, reusing those window units so you don&#39;t need a variance for the window dimension over the 12-foot dormer. So I have a hard time supporting the set of hardship variances for all the same reasons everybody&#39;s been talking about. And what&#39;s also happening in the back of my mind is I can imagine a path where you can make a 12-foot dormer work for this kitchen. It&#39;s certainly not as generous as whoever had originally laid it out had envisioned, but I would have a hard time supporting these variances because of that.</td>
