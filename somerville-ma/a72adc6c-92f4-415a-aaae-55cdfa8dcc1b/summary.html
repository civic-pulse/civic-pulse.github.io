<h3 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h3>
<p>The Somerville Zoning Board of Appeals convened remotely to address several agenda items. Key actions included the approval of minutes from the August 20, 2025 meeting and the continuation of the case for 872 Broadway to October 1, 2025. The primary discussion revolved around the continued public hearing for 8 Melvin Street, concerning a hardship variance for dormer face width standards. After extensive deliberation, the Board approved the hardship variance for ZP25-000048, allowing an 11-foot 7-inch dormer face width, despite the maximum allowed being 8 feet 4 inches, citing the unusual character of the existing structure and potential financial hardship. The applicant subsequently withdrew applications ZP25-000047 and ZP25-000049 without prejudice.</p>

<p><strong>Case: 8 Melvin Street (ZP25-000048, ZP25-000047, ZP25-000049)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Background:</strong> This case was continued from the August 20, 2025 meeting. The applicant, represented by Rob Passione from the architectural studio, presented revised plans for a dormer. The discussion centered on a hardship variance for dormer face width standards.</li>
<li><strong>Applicant Presentation (Rob Passione):</strong><ul>
<li>Presented a revised plan with the dormer reduced to 11 feet 7 inches, which the applicant believes meets dormer separation requirements.</li>
<li>Noted that the 11-foot 7-inch dormer configuration still results in a zoning variance violation due to exceeding 36 inches of solid wall width.</li>
<li>Showed a revised kitchen layout for the 11-foot 7-inch dormer, which was described as "not ideal" and "a really tiny kitchen" for an affordable unit.</li>
<li>Expressed a preference to revert to the original 13-foot 1-inch dormer, which would allow for a "considerably larger more useful kitchen" and would result in two hardship variances.</li>
<li>Clarified that the dormer is located on the side of the building, not facing the street.</li>
<li>Krishna (applicant's partner) confirmed that the dormer itself was pre-existing, but the window within it was changed to a casement window of the same size.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Board Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Brian Cook:</strong> Expressed confusion regarding the applicant's request, noting that the 13-foot 1-inch option would bring back two hardship variances, as discussed at the previous meeting. Emphasized the difficulty in satisfying Criterion 1 (unusual shape of lot or structure) for hardship variances.</li>
<li><strong>Ann Brockleman:</strong> Confirmed the unit is an "officially approved affordable unit." Questioned the presentation of two options, stating the Board was expecting a presentation on the reduced 11-foot 7-inch dormer. Clarified that with the 11-foot 7-inch option, the only remaining variance is for the window (exceeding 36 inches of solid wall surface).</li>
<li><strong>Madison Anthony (Staff):</strong> Confirmed that the 13-foot 1-inch option would indeed require two hardship variances. Also confirmed that the dormer face width standard (ZP25-000048) is still not met with the 11-foot 7-inch dormer.</li>
<li><strong>Cecilia Dagleon:</strong> Indicated support for the 11-foot 7-inch dormer with the single window variance, provided it's the only variance. Inquired about the bathroom window change and if it created new compliance issues; Madison Anthony confirmed ISD found no new issues.</li>
<li><strong>Discussion on Hardship Criteria (Criterion 1 &amp; 2):</strong><ul>
<li>Board members discussed how to articulate findings for Criterion 1 ("unusual shape of a lot or unusual features of the structure") and Criterion 2 (financial hardship).</li>
<li><strong>Ann Brockleman:</strong> Suggested that the "unusual character of the existing structure" is the dormer that was already built in violation, and literal enforcement (requiring removal and full compliance) would be a "huge hardship."</li>
<li><strong>Brian Cook:</strong> Proposed that the "nature of the existing structure" and the "configuration of the roof" made it difficult to create a functional third apartment, and literal enforcement would impose "significant financial hardship."</li>
<li><strong>Consensus:</strong> The Board agreed that the existing structure's configuration and the financial hardship of reconfiguring the dormer to full compliance could satisfy Criterion 1 and 2. Criterion 3 (no detriment to public good) was previously deemed met.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Public Comment:</strong> Kit Lester confirmed no members of the public wished to speak.</li>
<li><strong>Chair's Statement (Susan Fontano):</strong> Expressed strong disapproval of the applicant's initial non-compliance and the burden placed on the Board. Stated that while she would vote in favor to avoid further hardship for the applicant, she was "not happy about it" and hoped the message would reach other contractors and developers about the importance of compliance.</li>
<li><strong>Motion for ZP25-000048:</strong> Brian Cook moved to approve the hardship variance for ZP25-000048 for relief from the Somerville Zoning Ordinance dormer face width standards, allowing a dormer face width of 11 feet 7 inches (when the maximum allowed with newly revised dimensions would be 8 feet 4 inches), based on the hardship criteria findings as discussed and with the conditions set forth in the second supplemental staff memo dated September 11, 2025.</li>
<li><strong>Second:</strong> Cecilia Dagleon</li>
<li><strong>Vote:</strong><ul>
<li>Brian Cook: Aye</li>
<li>Ann Brockleman: Aye</li>
<li>Cecilia Dagleon: Aye</li>
<li>Susan Fontano: Aye</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Outcome:</strong> Motion carried unanimously (4-0).</li>
<li><strong>Withdrawal of Other Applications:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong> Brian Cook raised the need to address ZP25-000047 and ZP25-000049, which were originally presented. Madison Anthony confirmed that withdrawing them without prejudice would be the best protocol. The applicant confirmed their desire to withdraw these applications.</li>
<li><strong>Motion:</strong> Brian Cook moved to approve the request for the withdrawal without prejudice of ZP25-000047 and ZP25-000049.</li>
<li><strong>Second:</strong> Ann Brockleman</li>
