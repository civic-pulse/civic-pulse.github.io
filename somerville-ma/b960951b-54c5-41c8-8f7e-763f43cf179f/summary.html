<ul>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li>DPW Commissioner Jill Latham addressed the order, stating that her team conducted walkthroughs of Magoon Square.</li>
<li>Observations included significant amounts of cigarette butts in tree wells, which have since been cleaned.</li>
<li>Commissioner Latham noted that Magoon Square is cleaned weekly, and trash is dumped daily.</li>
<li>The condition of "Big Belly" trash receptacles was reviewed; some require minor maintenance and will be power washed.</li>
<li>Commissioner Latham emphasized the responsibility of business owners to maintain the areas around their establishments.</li>
<li>Regarding power washing sidewalks, Commissioner Latham stated that this is not a regular practice due to resource limitations (equipment, water trucks) and current focus on plant watering.</li>
<li>Councilor Scott inquired about the maintenance of green infrastructure and stormwater elements, suggesting that additional resources, such as a dedicated three-person crew, might be necessary to manage the growing infrastructure.</li>
<li>Commissioner Latham acknowledged that continued city beautification and growth will necessitate additional resources to meet capacity needs for maintenance.</li>

<li><strong>Outcome:</strong> Work complete.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li>Councilor Clingan noted that a memo from the Director of Traffic and Parking was provided, addressing the issue from a traffic enforcement perspective (e.g., "no truck" signs, app usage for truck routes).</li>
<li>Councilor Clingan shared a personal anecdote about a garbage truck snagging a wire on his street, questioning if wires could sag over time due to factors like wind.</li>
<li>He proposed exploring a "minimum clearance" standard for overhead wires to prevent future incidents.</li>
<li>Commissioner Latham acknowledged the observation and stated she would discuss the feasibility of such a plan with her Lights and Lines crew to determine a manageable and sustainable approach.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Outcome:</strong> Work complete.</li>

Resolution by Councilor Scott that the administration, including the director mobility discussed with this council the process for establishing municipal standards for furnishings at bus stops and shelters.</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li>Intergovernmental Affairs Director Singh represented the administration, as Mobility Director Brad Rawson was unavailable.</li>
<li>Director Singh outlined the city's next steps:<ul>
<li>Review and document existing city standards for street, park, and schoolyard furniture.</li>
<li>Review and document MBTA system-wide standards for bus stop furnishings.</li>
<li>Review and document MBTA bus stop asset inventory in Somerville.</li>
<li>Share this information with relevant city boards and commissions (PTAC, Commission on Persons with Disabilities, Council on Aging) to solicit feedback on bench standards.</li>
<li>Based on feedback, make changes to planning and design processes to establish long-term standards.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Councilor Clingan inquired about the scope of "furnishings" (seating, lighting, covered shelters) and the city's influence over MBTA-funded furnishings.</li>
<li>Director Singh confirmed that the bench prompting this order was funded by participatory budgeting.</li>
<li>Councilor Scott clarified that the order was prompted by "hostile architecture" in new bus shelters on Washington Street, funded by city funds, and the need for uniform standards across all bus stops.</li>
<li>Councilor Scott requested the item remain in committee to allow Director Rawson to provide further details and ensure a comprehensive discussion on future infrastructure improvements.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Outcome:</strong> Held in committee.</li>

<h3 id="4-order-by-councilor-sait-wilson-burnley-that-eversource-explained-the-reason-behind-repeated-power-outages-in-magoon-square-and-share-what-they-have-done-to-address-them-in-the-near-term-and-what-is-being-done-to-prevent-long-term-interference">4. Order by Councilor Sait, Wilson, Burnley, that Eversource explained the reason behind repeated power outages in Magoon Square and share what they have done to address them in the near term and what is being done to prevent long-term interference.</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li>A memo from Jason Wright, Eversource Community Relations Representative (via Bill Fisher, Director of Emergency Management), was provided.</li>
<li><strong>Key passages from the memo:</strong><ul>
<li>"In the timeframe identified, there were 26 unplanned outages in the area, two of two of the distribute distribution circuits that feed Magoon Square, have had a bulk of unplanned outages."</li>
<li>"There is one 4KV circuit that has several equipment failure issues this year in particular."</li>
<li>"Eversource System Planning has identified the 4KV station and circuits, and they will be converted to a 13.8KV in the next 10 years."</li>
<li>"And the circuit that has had outages this year is on the conversion plan. But the conversion primary and secondary cable will be replaced along with the switches and other equipment."</li>
<li>"In the meantime, before the conversion, several sections of cable have been replaced. Additionally, switches have been replaced in order to increase reliability and the ability of operations to pick up load more quickly and reach more customers."</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Councilor Scott expressed concern about the "next 10 years" timeline for the 13.8KV conversion, requesting a more concrete timeline from Eversource.</li>
<li>Councilor Clingan suggested following up with Eversource for a more specific timeline, potentially through another order or direct communication, rather than bringing them to committee again.</li>
<li>Councilor Clingan noted personal interest due to related outages in the Winter Hill area.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Outcome:</strong> Work complete.</li>
</ul>
