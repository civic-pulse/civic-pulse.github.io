<h3 id="4-chapter-91-request-and-presentation-proposed-mystic-river-bicyclepedestrian-bridge">4. Chapter 91 Request and Presentation - Proposed Mystic River Bicycle/Pedestrian Bridge</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Presenters:</strong> Richard Jabra (MassDOT/DCR), Bill Conway (MassDOT), Melissa Lenker (MassDOT), Dick Grotenhaus (AECOM).</li>
<li><strong>Project Overview:</strong><ul>
<li>The proposed project is a bicycle and pedestrian bridge over the Mystic River, connecting DCR Draw 7 Park (Somerville side) to the Encore Casino area (Everett side).</li>
<li>MassDOT is managing the project and permitting, with DCR as the future owner and operator.</li>
<li>The project requires a Chapter 91 signature from the Planning Board, as mandated by DEP waterways.</li>
<li>The bridge will be supported by five piers, three of which will be in the river.</li>
<li>The design includes a steel arch over the center span, similar to a previously approved project by the Conservation Commission, but now wider (18 feet clear, up from 12 feet).</li>
<li><strong>Compliance:</strong> The project aims to promote public access and waterfront features, maintain navigable waterways, comply with fill and structure requirements, and preserve water-related public rights.</li>
<li><strong>Timeline:</strong><ul>
<li>25% design complete.</li>
<li>Permitting completion: March 2026.</li>
<li>Design-build RFP: March 2026.</li>
<li>Construction start: Fall 2026.</li>
<li>Construction end: Spring 2029.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Lynn Richards</strong> questioned the Planning Board's specific role and jurisdiction in reviewing Chapter 91 projects, particularly regarding design details and how the project aligns with Somerville's broader goals, given the significant infrastructure expenditure. She noted the limited information on conceptual drawings despite the 25% design stage.</li>
<li><strong>Richard Jabra</strong> clarified that the Planning Board had an opportunity to provide comments during the public comment period (June 11th - July 11th) for the Chapter 91 application. He also stated that the project has detailed engineered drawings and has undergone review by MassDOT and DEP. He mentioned that the Somerville Planning Board previously went through a similar process for the Draw 7 Park Chapter 91 license.</li>
<li><strong>William Conroy (MassDOT Project Manager)</strong> announced a 25% design public hearing scheduled for October 21st, which will be a virtual meeting to gather public feedback. He emphasized that MassDOT takes public comments seriously and works with Somerville, Everett, and DCR on the design, including safety and ADA compliance.</li>
<li><strong>Michael Capuano</strong> acknowledged the novelty of this type of application for both the Planning Board and MassDOT. He requested clarification from the city's legal department regarding the Planning Board's specific role and scope of review for Chapter 91 projects.</li>
<li><strong>Dirk Grotenhaus (AECOM)</strong> reiterated that the Planning Board has the option to solicit comments and make recommendations to DEP waterways.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Action:</strong> The Board decided to seek an opinion from the city's legal department to clarify the Planning Board's role in Chapter 91 projects.</li>
<li><strong>Motion:</strong> The Chair moved to continue this agenda item to September 18th.</li>
<li><strong>Second:</strong> Jahan Habib.</li>
<li><strong>Vote:</strong><ul>
<li>Jahan Habib: Aye</li>
<li>Lynn Richards: Aye</li>
<li>Luke Schuster: Aye</li>
<li>Michael Capuano: Aye</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Outcome:</strong> The continuance was approved unanimously (4-0).</li>

<h3 id="5-major-amendment-3-craigie-street-675-somerville-llc">5. Major Amendment - 3 Craigie Street (675 Somerville LLC)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Applicant:</strong> 675 Somerville LLC</li>
<li><strong>Representatives:</strong> Adam Dash (Attorney), Alexander Varelis (675 Somerville LLC), Sylvia Ilya Sheldahl (BOS Urban Architecture), Paxton Sheldahl (BOS Urban Architecture), Christian Humania (Offshoots - Landscape Architects), Krista Lucas (Howardstein Hudson - Traffic Engineer).</li>
<li><strong>Project Description:</strong> Proposed redevelopment of 675 Somerville Avenue and 3 Craigie Street (former gas station and auto shop) into a new three-story, 14-unit rental building with commercial space on the first floor in the MR3 zoning district, with no parking.</li>
<li><strong>Revisions and Responses to Previous Concerns:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Commercial Deliveries:</strong> All commercial deliveries will be made via the front entrance on Somerville Avenue, not the egress alley.</li>
<li><strong>Egress Alley Gate:</strong> The proposed gate in the egress alley will have a soft-close feature to reduce noise.</li>
<li><strong>Trash Handling:</strong><ul>
<li>The proposed solution involves fully enclosed trash within the building and a fully fenced recycling area in the back of the egress corridor, adjacent to the abutter's parking lot.</li>
<li>Adding a two cubic yard dumpster room, as suggested by abutters, would reduce commercial space and residential lobbies below zoning compliance.</li>
<li>The transformer area in the back is the only viable location for Eversource.</li>
<li>The proposed system is considered less impactful than the current situation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Fencing:</strong> The proposed fencing along the building's length has been removed to ensure unobstructed use of the fire escape and allow for proper maintenance and access. Fencing will be along the backyard property line, on top of the drainage barrier, not interfering with safety or access.</li>
<li><strong>Water Runoff:</strong> A continuous curb will prevent water runoff, and a drain at the landing will address water, directing it towards the property.</li>
<li><strong>Egress Corridor Planting:</strong> A living wall is not recommended for the egress path due to insufficient sunlight and the need to keep the path clear for emergency egress.</li>
<li><strong>Curb Cuts &amp; Traffic:</strong><ul>
<li>Three curb cuts (two on Somerville Ave, one on Craigie Street) will be closed.</li>
<li>A Transportation Access Plan (TAP) has been submitted, outlining access for walking, rolling, biking, and driving (though no driving on-site).</li>
<li><strong>Good News:</strong> The City of Somerville's Mobility Division is implementing a "quick build" project on Somerville Avenue to create protected bike lanes by swapping parking and bike lane locations. This will address double parking concerns and will be constructed before this project's completion.</li>
<li>All regulations and the TAP will go to the Traffic Commission for approval.</li>
<li>The project will continue to coordinate with the Mobility Division for final curbside restrictions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Unit Mix (Three-Bedroom Units):</strong> The applicant is not proposing three-bedroom units, as the current unit mix (smaller households) aligns with the intent of the MR3 zone (Zoning Ordinance 4.1.3.D). The building is relatively small (under 15,000 sq ft, 14 units).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Public Comment:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Lynn Richards</strong> reiterated her concern about the city's proactive role in facilitating non-solo car travel, particularly regarding designated drop-off zones for services like Uber/Lyft and deliveries. She suggested that for projects with more than 3-5 units, the city should institutionalize 15-minute parking drop-off spaces.</li>
<li><strong>Luke Schuster</strong> expressed strong support for the project, noting that the applicant thoughtfully addressed previous questions and concerns.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Outcome:</strong> The Board expressed satisfaction with the applicant's responses and the project's overall improvements.</li>
<li><strong>Motion 1 (Site Plan Approval):</strong> Following public testimony, review of submitted materials, and deliberation of required considerations outlined by the zoning ordinance, the Chair moved to approve, with the conditions outlined in the staff memorandum, the site plan approval to develop a general building in the district.</li>
<li><strong>Second:</strong> Jahan Habib.</li>
<li><strong>Vote:</strong><ul>
<li>Jahan Habib: Aye</li>
<li>Lynn Richards: Aye</li>
<li>Luke Schuster: Aye</li>
<li>Michael Capuano: Aye</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Outcome:</strong> The site plan approval was approved unanimously (4-0).</li>
<li><strong>Motion 2 (Special Permit):</strong> Following public testimony, review of submitted materials, and deliberation of required considerations and findings outlined by the ordinance, the Chair moved to approve, with the conditions outlined in the staff memorandum, the request to establish a residential housing use in the zoning district.</li>
<li><strong>Second:</strong> Jahan Habib.</li>
<li><strong>Vote:</strong><ul>
<li>Jahan Habib: Aye</li>
<li>Lynn Richards: Aye</li>
<li>Luke Schuster: Aye</li>
<li>Michael Capuano: Aye</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Outcome:</strong> The special permit was approved unanimously (4-0).</li>

<h3 id="6-major-amendment-59-bow-street-59-61-bow-street-llc">6. Major Amendment - 59 Bow Street (59-61 Bow Street LLC)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Clerk's Reading of Notice of Public Hearing:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>59 Bow Street:</strong> 59-61 Bow Street LLC seeks a major amendment to the previously issued Site Plan Approval PNZ21-017 in the MR5 zoning district, ZP24-000099.</li>
<li><strong>59-61 Bow Street:</strong> 59-61 Bow Street LLC seeks a major amendment to a previously issued Special Permit PNC 21-017 in the MR5 zoning district, ZP24-000098.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Applicant:</strong> 59-61 Bow Street LLC</li>
<li><strong>Representatives:</strong> Anne Vigorito (Attorney), Tanya Carrier (CULSA Design), Noria Spalas (CULSA Design), Ilan Sassoon (Developer).</li>
<li><strong>Project Description:</strong> Seeking a major amendment to a previously approved project (March 2024).</li>
<li><strong>Key Revisions:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Basement Elimination:</strong> The originally proposed basement became infeasible due to high groundwater levels and shoring difficulties.</li>
<li><strong>Bike Storage &amp; Mechanical:</strong> Moved from the basement to grade level for easier access.</li>
<li><strong>Unit Count &amp; Type Mix:</strong><ul>
<li>Total units decreased from 15 to 13.</li>
<li>Two ground floor units eliminated due to basement changes.</li>
<li>Fifth-story unit changed from a two-bedroom to a one-bedroom.</li>
<li>Affordable units: Mathematically, 2.6 units, requiring a fractional share payment to the city.</li>
<li>Original: 3 two-bedroom, 9 one-bedroom, 3 studio.</li>
<li>Proposed: 2 two-bedroom, 9 one-bedroom, 2 studio.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Floor Plans:</strong> Reconfigured to accommodate the elimination of the basement and relocation of bike storage/mechanical areas. Commercial area slightly increased.</li>
<li><strong>Building Exterior &amp; Design:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Balconies:</strong> Six balconies eliminated on the Bow Street Place side due to proximity to electrical wires (Eversource clearance requirements). The remaining three balconies will be kept.</li>
<li><strong>Roof Decks:</strong> Two common roof decks added on the fifth story to replace eliminated balconies and provide outdoor amenity space. A new common lounge area was also added.</li>
<li><strong>Bow Street Side Material:</strong> Minor change to the material of that area (wrapped brick where massing breaks, changed to a cementitious panel).</li>
<li><strong>Restaurant Entry Door:</strong> Minor change to the commercial entry door, with brick detailing accent.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Eversource Transformer Vault:</strong> A work order number and approved design plan from Eversource were provided for the transformer vault on Bow Street Place.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Michael Capuano</strong> confirmed that the revisions primarily stemmed from the infeasibility of the basement and balcony issues, leading to outdoor space reconfiguration.</li>
<li><strong>Eversource Confirmation:</strong> The Board requested staff (Madison) to review the provided Eversource documentation to ensure it meets the city's requirements for approval.</li>
<li><strong>Public Comment:</strong> No public comments were received in support or opposition.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Action:</strong> The written comment period will remain open until September 12th at 9:00 AM (planningboard@somervillema.gov) to allow staff to review the Eversource documentation and for any additional public input.</li>
<li><strong>Motion:</strong> The Chair moved to continue this agenda item to September 18th.</li>
<li><strong>Second:</strong> Jahan Habib.</li>
<li><strong>Vote:</strong><ul>
<li>Jahan Habib: Aye</li>
<li>Lynn Richards: Aye</li>
<li>Luke Schuster: Aye</li>
