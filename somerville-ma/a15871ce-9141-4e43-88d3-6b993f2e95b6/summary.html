<ul>
<li><strong>Presenters:</strong> Richard Jarba (MassDOT/DCR), William Conroy (MassDOT), Melissa Lenker (MassDOT), Dick Grotenhaus (AECOM).</li>

<li><strong>Key Details:</strong><ul>
<li>MassDOT is managing the project and permitting; DCR will own and operate the bridge.</li>
<li>The bridge will be supported by five piers, three of which will be in the river.</li>
<li>The design includes a navigation channel for vessels.</li>
<li>The bridge design has been modified from an original 12-foot clear width to an 18-foot clear width.</li>

</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Chapter 91 Compliance:</strong> The project is located in filled tidelands and flow tidelands, requiring Chapter 91 compliance. It aims to promote public access and waterfront features, maintain navigable waterways, comply with fill and structure requirements, and preserve water-related public rights.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Board Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li>Lynn Richards raised concerns about the Planning Board's specific role in reviewing Chapter 91 projects, particularly regarding design details, ADA access, and overall alignment with Somerville's goals, given the significant infrastructure expenditure.</li>
<li>William Conroy (MassDOT) clarified that a 25% design public hearing is scheduled for October 21st, 2025, where public feedback on design specifics will be solicited. He also noted this is the first time MassDOT has presented a Chapter 91 license request to a local planning board.</li>

<h3 id="5-major-amendment-to-site-plan-approval-and-special-permit-3-craigie-street-zp24-000099-zp24-000098">5. Major Amendment to Site Plan Approval and Special Permit - 3 Craigie Street (ZP24-000099 &amp; ZP24-000098)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Applicant:</strong> 675 Somerville LLC</li>
<li><strong>Representatives:</strong> Adam Dash (Attorney), Alexander Varelis (675 Somerville LLC), Sylvia Ilya Sheldahl (BOS Urban Architecture), Paxton Sheldahl (BOS Urban Architecture), Christian Humania (Offshoots - Landscape Architects), Krista Lucas (Howardstein Hudson - Traffic Engineer).</li>
<li><strong>Project Description:</strong> Proposed redevelopment of 675 Somerville Avenue and 3 Craigie Street (former gas station and auto shop) into a new three-story, 14-unit rental building with ground-floor commercial space in the MR3 zoning district, with no parking.</li>
<li><strong>Updates and Responses to Previous Concerns:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Commercial Deliveries:</strong> Confirmed that all commercial deliveries will be made via the front entrance on Somerville Avenue, not the egress alley.</li>
<li><strong>Gate Noise:</strong> Agreed to implement a soft-close feature on the egress alley gate to reduce noise.</li>
<li><strong>Trash Handling:</strong><ul>
<li>The applicant reviewed suggestions for a two-cubic-yard dumpster but stated it would reduce commercial/residential lobby space below zoning requirements.</li>
<li>Proposed an enclosed trash area within the building and a fully fenced recycling area adjacent to the abutter's parking lot, away from windows.</li>
<li>Sylvia Sheldahl: "The recycling area is in the back of the egress corridor adjacent to the batter's parking lot and their own trash recycling area. So this is, we believe, 100% compatible with the current use and it is far away from the existing windows of the unit."</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Fencing and Runoff:</strong><ul>
<li>Revised fencing along the backyard property line to be set back, not interfering with the abutter's fire escape landing.</li>
<li>A continuous curb and a drain at the egress landing will address water runoff, directing it towards the applicant's property.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Egress Path Planting:</strong><ul>
<li>The applicant does not recommend a living wall due to lack of sunlight and the need to keep the path clear for emergency egress.</li>
<li>The 10-foot wide egress corridor maintains distance for existing non-fire-rated construction and unprotected openings on the abutter's property.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Curbside Uses/Traffic:</strong><ul>
<li>Krista Lucas (Howardstein Hudson) reported coordination with the Mobility Division.</li>
<li>The project will close three existing curb cuts (two on Somerville Ave, one on Craigie Street).</li>
<li>A designated loading zone is proposed for typical deliveries.</li>
<li><strong>Good News:</strong> The City of Somerville has a "quick build" project planned for Somerville Avenue to create protected bike lanes by swapping parking and bike lane locations, which will address double-parking concerns before this project's completion.</li>
<li>The Traffic Commission will approve all regulations, and the applicant will continue to coordinate with the Mobility Division for final curbside restrictions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Unit Mix (Three-Bedroom Units):</strong><ul>
<li>Adam Dash stated the applicant is not proposing three-bedroom units.</li>
<li>This aligns with the intent of the MR3 zone (Zoning Ordinance 4.1.3.D) to create dwelling unit types for smaller households.</li>
<li>The project is a relatively small building (under 15,000 sq ft, 14 units).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Public Comment:</strong> No members of the public spoke in support or opposition.</li>
<li><strong>Board Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li>Lynn Richards commended the applicant for addressing concerns, particularly regarding traffic. She emphasized the city's responsibility to proactively create drop-off zones for deliveries and ride-shares in new developments to facilitate non-single-occupancy vehicle travel.</li>
<li>Luc Schuster expressed support for the project, noting the thoughtful responses to previous questions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Motion 1 (Site Plan Approval):</strong> Following public testimony, review of submitted materials, and deliberation of required considerations outlined by the zoning ordinance, the Chair moved to approve, with the conditions outlined in the staff memorandum, the site plan approval to develop a general building in the MR3 district.</li>
<li><strong>Second:</strong> Jahan Habib.</li>
<li><strong>Vote (Roll Call):</strong><ul>
<li>Jahan Habib: Aye</li>
<li>Lynn Richards: Aye</li>
<li>Luc Schuster: Aye</li>
<li>Michael Capuano: Aye</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Outcome:</strong> The site plan approval for 3 Craigie Street was approved (4-0).</li>
<li><strong>Motion 2 (Special Permit):</strong> Following public testimony, review of submitted materials, and deliberation of required considerations and findings outlined by the ordinance, the Chair moved to approve, with the conditions outlined in the staff memorandum, the request to establish a residential housing use in the MR3 zoning district.</li>
<li><strong>Second:</strong> Jahan Habib.</li>
<li><strong>Vote (Roll Call):</strong><ul>
<li>Jahan Habib: Aye</li>
<li>Lynn Richards: Aye</li>
<li>Luc Schuster: Aye</li>
<li>Michael Capuano: Aye</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Outcome:</strong> The special permit for 3 Craigie Street was approved (4-0).</li>
