<h3 id="2-grant-acceptance-and-expansion-fossil-fuel-free-ordinance-study">2. Grant Acceptance and Expansion - Fossil Fuel Free Ordinance Study</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Agenda Item ID:</strong> 25-1295</li>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> Request by the Mayor for approval to accept and expand a $50,000 grant with no new match required from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs to the Office of Sustainability and Environment for a study investigating possible zoning incentives to increase compliance with the fossil fuel-free ordinance.</li>
<li><strong>Key Discussion Points:</strong><ul>
<li>Christine Blaise, Director of the Mayor's Office of Sustainability and Environment, explained that the city was awarded $50,000, down from an initial application of $75,000.</li>
<li>The grant will fund a study by VHB and Autocase to develop zoning amendment recommendations and financial analyses to encourage compliance with the fossil fuel-free ordinance (passed November 2023).</li>
<li>The study aims to reduce variance requests by focusing on solutions like oversizing transformers in new developments and creating community benefits for electrification projects.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Decision:</strong> Laid on the table to recommend approval.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-police-department-items-items-3-6">3. Police Department Items (Items 3-6)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong> Director Wisdom was unable to attend.</li>
<li><strong>Decision:</strong> Items 3-6 were left in committee for discussion at the next meeting.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-small-dollar-figure-prior-invoices-items-7-12">4. Small Dollar Figure Prior Invoices (Items 7-12)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Agenda Item IDs:</strong> 7-12</li>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> Batch approval of several small dollar figure prior invoices.</li>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong> No specific questions were raised by committee members after a brief pause for review.</li>
<li><strong>Decision:</strong> Laid on the table to recommend approval.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-prior-invoices-and-fund-transfer-department-of-infrastructure-and-asset-management-iam">5. Prior Invoices and Fund Transfer - Department of Infrastructure and Asset Management (IAM)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Agenda Item ID:</strong> 25-1410 (Item 13)</li>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> Request from the Mayor requesting approval to pay prior invoices totaling $10,452.22 using available funds in the Department of Infrastructure and Asset Management, Ordinary Maintenance Professional and Technical Account for Strategic Asset Management Plan.</li>
<li><strong>Agenda Item ID:</strong> 25-1412 (Item 14)</li>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> Mayor's request for approval of a transfer of $350,048 from the Department of Infrastructure and Asset Management (IAM), Ordinary Maintenance Professional and Technical Services account to the IAM Capital Outlay Professional and Technical Services account.</li>
<li><strong>Key Discussion Points:</strong><ul>
<li>Michael Richards, Director of Finance and Administration for IAM, explained that the $10,452.22 invoice was for the Strategic Asset Management program, part of an ongoing project.</li>
<li>The transfer of $350,048 is to reclassify funds from an Ordinary Maintenance (OM) line, intended for fiscal year purchases, to a Capital Outlay line. This change is necessary because the Strategic Asset Management program is a longitudinal study spanning multiple fiscal years, similar to capital projects.</li>
<li>An oversight in the initial setup of the IAM department led to the use of an OM line for this multi-year project, resulting in the loss of approximately $70,000-$80,000 from the line at the end of the previous fiscal year as funds could not be moved to a stabilization fund.</li>
<li>The reclassification will allow for greater flexibility in managing multi-year projects and moving remaining balances into a stabilization fund.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Decision:</strong> Laid on the table to recommend approval.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="6-bond-authorization-morrison-avenue-linear-storage-sewer-separation-project">6. Bond Authorization - Morrison Avenue Linear Storage Sewer Separation Project</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Agenda Item ID:</strong> 25-1411 (Item 15)</li>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> The Mayor requesting authorization to borrow $4,300,000 in a bond and to appropriate the same amount for the design of the Morrison Avenue Linear Storage Sewer Separation Project.</li>
<li><strong>Key Discussion Points:</strong><ul>
<li>Director Michael Richards stated this is a Phase 2 authorization for the project, following a $2 million bond approved two years prior for initial design.</li>
<li>The $4.3 million is for 30% through final design and bid administration, with $3.8 million for design and $500,000 for contingency.</li>
<li>Director Brian Postlethwaite clarified that "linear storage" refers to using a large-diameter pipe along Morrison Avenue (from Cedar Street to Grove Street) to store stormwater, minimizing flooding in Davis Square.</li>
<li>Councilor Burnley inquired about the "linear" aspect, and Director Postlethwaite explained it's a long pipe acting as a tank.</li>
<li>Councilor Scott noted the project's importance due to significant flooding in the area.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Decision:</strong> Laid on the table to recommend approval.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="8-299-broadway-related-items-items-17-20">8. 299 Broadway Related Items (Items 17-20)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Agenda Item IDs:</strong> 25-1385 (Item 17), 25-1386 (Item 18), 25-1387 (Item 19), 25-1388 (Item 20)</li>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> Four related items concerning the 299 Broadway development (old Star Market site).<ul>
<li><strong>Item 17:</strong> Discontinuance of a portion of Sewell Court.</li>
<li><strong>Item 19:</strong> Termination of an easement related to the discontinued portion of Sewell Court.</li>
<li><strong>Item 20:</strong> Order of taking for Lot 3 at 299 Broadway for a municipal parking lot and access driveway.</li>
<li><strong>Item 18:</strong> Granting of temporary and permanent easements for construction and maintenance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Key Discussion Points:</strong><ul>
<li>Director Brian Postlethwaite explained that a vestigial private way (Sewell Court) and an old utility easement extended into the Star Market parking lot. Discontinuing the unused portion of Sewell Court and terminating the easement is necessary to "clean up" deeds for the 40B affordable housing project.</li>
<li>Councilor Clingan inquired about the visual impact and property lines, which were clarified using a map. The discontinued portion effectively becomes part of the 299 Broadway property.</li>
<li>Attorney Salkert addressed Items 18 and 20. Lot 3 is being taken for a municipal parking lot and access driveway.</li>
<li>A temporary easement will be granted for construction purposes, remaining until the completion of buildings A and B or improvements on Lot 3, whichever is later.</li>
<li>A permanent maintenance easement will require the owners of Lot 1 and Lot 2 to maintain, repair, or replace improvements on Lot 3.</li>
<li>Councilor Scott noted a scrivener's error in the taking document regarding the gender of the City Council President, which Attorney Salkert acknowledged as not having legal ramifications.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Decision:</strong> Laid on the table to recommend approval for all four items (17-20).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="9-ice-cooperation-requirements-in-federal-grants">9. ICE Cooperation Requirements in Federal Grants</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Agenda Item ID:</strong> 25-1445 (Item 21)</li>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> Order by Councilor Burnley that the City Solicitor update this Council on the new Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) cooperation requirements attached to the forthcoming Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI) grants.</li>
<li><strong>Agenda Item ID:</strong> 25-1446 (Item 22)</li>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> Order by Councilor Burnley that the Chief of Police or the Metro Boston Homeland Security Region representative update this Council on the strategy for applying for Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI) or any other federal grants that require Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) cooperation.</li>
<li><strong>Key Discussion Points:</strong><ul>
<li>Councilor Burnley expressed concern about new UASI grant conditions requiring recipients to allocate at least 10% of funds to "supporting border crisis response and enforcement." Examples include authorizing state/local officers to perform immigration functions, cooperating with ICE detainers, or supporting activities like officer training and information sharing.</li>
<li>Councilor Burnley highlighted the conflict with Somerville's sanctuary city status, particularly regarding ICE detainers. He also questioned information sharing through the Boston Regional Intelligence Center (BRIC).</li>
<li>Director Singh clarified that the state, as the applicant, has reserved its right to review terms and conditions, and applying for the grant does not automatically mean accepting these new conditions. The city intends to pursue the funding for public safety equipment and initiatives.</li>
<li>Councilor Clingan thanked Councilor Burnley for raising the issue, expressing concern but hoping for a way to "thread the needle" to secure funding without compromising city values.</li>
<li>Councilor Scott emphasized that the state has the first opportunity to decline conditions, and if the grants reach the city, the Mayor and City Council would have further opportunities to decline if conditions are unacceptable. He stated he would not vote to approve grants with such conditions.</li>
<li>Councilor Burnley reiterated that current UASI grants do not contain this language, but future rounds might. He noted that the state's position on not agreeing to the language is premised on ongoing litigation (Illinois v. FEMA), and if that case is decided differently, the federal government might be able to impose these requirements.</li>
<li>Councilor Burnley asked Director Singh about the timeline for the next funding round. Director Singh did not have the exact timeline but would follow up with Chief Benford.</li>
<li>Councilor Burnley stressed the importance of monitoring these developments and ensuring the city's sanctuary city values are upheld.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Decision:</strong> Both items (21 and 22) were left in committee for further discussion and updates.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="10-accounting-of-unspent-stabilization-accounts">10. Accounting of Unspent Stabilization Accounts</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Agenda Item ID:</strong> 25-1344 (Item 23)</li>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> Order by Councilor Mbah that the Director of Finance provide a comprehensive accounting of all stabilization accounts that have remained unspent for three or more fiscal years and provide a report for each fund.</li>
<li><strong>Key Discussion Points:</strong><ul>
<li>The committee received three documents related to this request, including balances and explanations.</li>
<li>Chair Wilson noted Councilor Mbah's absence and suggested holding the item in committee to allow him to participate in the discussion.</li>
<li>Councilor Burnley thanked Councilor Mbah for the request, stating the document provides valuable insight into city funds, including "rainy day funds" and grants. He emphasized the importance of transparency and the potential to use these funds to serve public needs, while acknowledging that different funds have different purposes and restrictions.</li>
<li>Councilor Clingan agreed, expressing a desire for more explanation on the purpose and origin of each fund, noting that some are designated for specific neighborhood improvements.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Decision:</strong> Left in committee to allow Councilor Mbah to be present for the discussion.</li>
</ul>
