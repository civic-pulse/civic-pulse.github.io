<h3 id="41-order-by-councillor-strezo-somerville-special-education-parents-advisory-council-cpac-report">4.1 Order by Councillor Strezo: Somerville Special Education Parents Advisory Council (CPAC) Report</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Item:</strong> Order by Councillor Strezo that this council discuss the Somerville Special Education Parents Advisory Council report sent to the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE) in response to the upcoming DESE District Review of Somerville Public Schools for the 2025-2026 school year.</li>
<li><strong>Councillor Strezo</strong> recused herself due to an immediate family member working in a school with out-of-district placements. Vice President Mbah presided over this item.</li>
<li><strong>Councillor Strezo</strong> (speaking before recusal):<ul>
<li>Expressed concern that special needs families and children, including the AIM program for autistic children at Winter Hill Innovation School, were not adequately included in discussions by the Construction Advisory Committee regarding the potential consolidation of Winter Hill and Brown Schools into a 900-student school.</li>
<li>Highlighted an example of a kindergartner at Healy School with undiagnosed autism whose sensory needs were triggered by the cafeteria environment, leading to behavioral issues.</li>
<li>Emphasized that school decisions are not just financial but impact families and the future of Somerville.</li>
<li>Introduced Liz Eldridge, Chair of Somerville CPAC, to speak on their report.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Liz Eldridge</strong>, Chair of Somerville CPAC:<ul>
<li>CPAC is a legally required organization in Massachusetts districts, serving an advisory and participatory role.</li>
<li>DESE notified Somerville in late February of a district review to analyze systems for closing achievement gaps and providing high-quality education.</li>
<li>CPAC submitted a 25-page report to DESE, based on district data, public records, and testimony from families and educators, to ensure their voices were heard.</li>
<li><strong>Key points from the report:</strong><ol>
<li>In early May, Somerville Special Education was designated "needs assistance" by DESE due to noncompliance issues and MCAS scores, requiring improvement activities.</li>
<li>A significant gap exists between the district's stated vision of equity and inclusion and the lived reality of students with disabilities, who often miss legally required services, face delayed evaluations, and have IEPs written based on staffing shortages rather than student needs.</li>
<li>Students with disabilities comprise over one-fifth (1,070 students) of the student population. 2024 MCAS data shows only 12% of students with disabilities (grades 3-8) were proficient in English Language Arts (compared to 46% of general education peers) and 10% in Math (compared to 39%).</li>
<li>Root causes are structural: understaffing, lack of training, inconsistent school-level planning, communication challenges, a weak multi-tiered system of support, and budgets that fail to prioritize legally mandated services.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Recommendations for change:</strong><ul>
<li>Ensure every student receives legally entitled education and support under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and Massachusetts regulations.</li>
<li>Address the "dual system" where aspirational plans differ from operational realities.</li>
<li>Implement IEPs based on student needs, requiring adequate funding, qualified staff, timely evaluations, and service delivery.</li>
<li>Create inclusive classrooms and buildings, staff co-teachers, provide paraprofessionals and specialist support, and train general education teachers in inclusive practices.</li>
<li>Meaningfully engage families and CPAC, and foster a culture of accountability, transparency, and inclusion.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Emphasized that the issue is systemic, not individual teachers or families, and requires urgent structural change.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Councillor Strezo</strong> requested the item be placed on file and urged colleagues to review the report.</li>
<li><strong>Outcome:</strong> Placed on file.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="6c-report-of-the-committee-on-legislative-matters-september-8th-2025">6C. Report of the Committee on Legislative Matters (September 8th, 2025)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Councillor Scott</strong> presented the report.</li>
<li>The committee met on Monday, September 8th, for 1 hour and 15 minutes, with four out of five members present.</li>
<li><strong>Item 1: Acceptance of Mass General Law Chapter 138, Section 12D</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> Allows current wine and malt beverage license holders to convert to an all-forms license.</li>
<li><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Approved by a 4-0-1 vote.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Item 2: Order from Councillor Mbah regarding Mass General Laws Chapter 53, Section 18B</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> Requires the city to send an informational packet to voters explaining ballot measures, including summaries and pro/con arguments.</li>
<li><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Discharged without a recommendation due to limited committee attendance and the desire for full council consideration.</li>
<li><strong>Discussion points from committee:</strong><ul>
<li>Concern from Mayor's staff and Elections Department about an estimated $40,000 cost for mailing.</li>
<li>Deadline issues: only one of three potential ballot measures (Palestine voter petition) was certified; the charter adoption and four-year mayoral term items awaited State House approval, with a deadline around September 19th or 30th, creating a bind for mailing timelines.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Motion:</strong> To accept the committee report as submitted.</li>
<li><strong>Outcome:</strong> Approved.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="25-1317-acceptance-of-mass-general-laws-chapter-138-section-12d">25-1317: Acceptance of Mass General Laws Chapter 138, Section 12D</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Item:</strong> That the City of Somerville hereby accepts the provisions of Chapter 53, Section 18B of the Massachusetts General Laws.</li>

<li>Explained that this state law enables cities to spend money on mailers to inform residents about ballot questions, which is otherwise prohibited.</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Councillor Ewen-Campen:</strong><ul>
<li>Supported the idea of informing voters but expressed concern that it was too late for the current election cycle due to logistical and timeline issues presented by the Elections Department.</li>
<li>Suggested acting on this for future years, potentially with a later start date.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Councillor Mbah:</strong><ul>
<li>As the maker of the motion, acknowledged that the omission of this provision during the charter review process was an oversight.</li>
<li>Thanked Harriet Randvig for bringing it to his attention and Beverly Schultz for her work on the city charter.</li>
<li>Read the text of Section 18B, emphasizing its purpose to provide full text, fair summaries, and pro/con arguments for ballot questions.</li>
<li>Requested <strong>Harriet Randvig</strong> (5 Leicester Terrace) to speak.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Harriet Randvig:</strong><ul>
<li>Acknowledged legal implications but suggested creative ways to make information available, such as printed copies in public places (libraries, City Hall).</li>
<li>Stated that the city website is not fully accessible to her as a blind computer user.</li>
<li>Emphasized the need for plain language to make the charter accessible to all citizens.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Councillor McLaughlin:</strong><ul>
<li>Clarified that the charter passed the Senate today and awaits the Governor's signature.</li>
<li>Corrected the notion of a "mistake" regarding the charter, stating that incorporating this law directly into the charter would not make sense; the current method is appropriate.</li>
<li>Expressed concern about rushing the decision, potentially leading to more mistakes and impacting other ballot questions.</li>
<li>Supported sending it back to committee for more discussion.</li>
<li>Noted the new charter is written in plain language and information is available at SomervilleMA.gov/charterreview.</li>
<li><strong>Sponsored Bev Schwartz</strong> to speak.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Bev Schwartz:</strong><ul>
<li>Stated that five charter committee members are volunteering to do outreach.</li>
<li>Suggested that the city could at least robo-call or email a link to the actual language of the charter, which is neutral information.</li>
<li>Emphasized the extensive work put into the charter and the need to reach new residents.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Councillor Wilson:</strong><ul>
<li>Agreed on the importance of transparency and informing voters.</li>
<li>Expressed concern about feasibility and logistics, fearing a rushed or incorrect implementation.</li>
<li>Supported the idea of a later start date for the provision.</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Motion:</strong> To refer the item back to committee.</li>
