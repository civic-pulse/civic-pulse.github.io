It&#39;s just a short presentation, but if there&#39;s questions that they may need answered, that would be the reasons for addressing them. Great. Richard Jabba, So again, it&#39;s this is for the proposed bicycle pedestrian bridge over mystic river again i&#39;m Richard Java been working on the project for the past eight years for tetra tech. On the permitting side, MassDOT is managing the project and the permitting with the applicants and the designer, and they&#39;ll be also working on the construction side. And then once the construction of the bridge is over, they&#39;ll turn it over to DCF for operation and maintenance. So I&#39;ll go over a few things that we got on the bridge in Chapter 91. Again, this was originally for a Chapter 91 signature for a planning form that the DEP waterways requires we obtain from each of the communities along the river. Again, as I mentioned, the master will be doing the contracting and the permitting for this. DCI will be the owner and operator. I&#39;m not sure how familiar you are with the project, but if you have any questions during this short presentation, let me know. So the project&#39;s located over the Mystic River and will land in both the DCI Draw 7 Park and on the Semmelville side and then on this Everett side land next to the Encore Casino. This is a view looking at it.</td>

                <td>All right, so I&#39;ll just leave in this view. So again, just showing the location of it. This is the only slide that I had shown that was different. This is the location of it crossing over the Mystic River between Dry 7 Park and the Encore site on the Everett side. Again, an aerial showing the existing MBTA bridge and where the proposed bridge is going to be located, extended on the north side from Everett to Draw 7 Park on the south side. Just a view of the landing in Somerville. It&#39;s currently under construction, but this is the landing area where the bridge will go underneath the existing MBTA bridge and land further on the right side into the proposed DCR park. And then again, just a view on the landing of the area on the Everett side, where it will be lined up parallel to the existing MBTA bridge. This is an elevation of the proposed bridge, Somerville being on the left side. It will be supported by five piers, Four of them will be, three of them will be in the river. The red area represents the passageway for the pedestrian walkway and DCR across Seven Park. And the red area on the center of the bridge is the navigation channel where most vessels will be passing through. The design, again, is supported by these piers and some V arches, and there&#39;ll be a steel arch over the center span. This is very similar to the project that was actually in front of the, approved by the Conservation Commission, you know, several years ago. It&#39;s slightly modified design, which is now a much wider bridge. It originally was 12 feet wide clear, and now it&#39;s 18 feet wide clear. Dave Kuntz, This is a profile again showing it. Dave Kuntz, Looking at it should be plan view showing it can where it lands and. Dave Kuntz, Draw seven park and its connections to propose pathways. Dave Kuntz, A couple views of the proposed bridge you looking from that some of those side towards the side on the left side in the right side of view of the arch. Dave Kuntz, Again, a couple other views showing what we anticipate look like. Dave Kuntz, Both. Dave Kuntz, perspective of any pedestrians a bicyclist and then cross section of the bridge show in the separation of the areas. Dave Kuntz, And this is a view of the rendering of the proposed. John Potter, draw seven park in the landing area where the bridge will land and then connect to various paths in the dry seven park. John Potter, Now we got in Chapter 91. John Potter, purpose of this of us getting a chapter 91 is because it isn&#39;t filled Thailand and flow tight lens and it must be compliant with the regulations for chapter 91. John Potter, The yellow line here on the left side is the historic high watermark so everything. A seaward of that is in Chapter 91 jurisdiction. So I&#39;ll just go over some of the Chapter 91 compliance and benefits. The key thing about this bridge is that it will definitely promote public access and waterfront features. mainly with the connecting walkways, some of which are still under construction, such as the Northern Strand on the north side, the DCR Draw 7 Park on the south side, and two existing pathways, such as a connection to Gateway Park and a boardwalk along the Encore Boston Harbor Resort. Some of the other key compliance for CHEP 91 is that it maintains a navigable waterway. It does comply with all the fill and structure requirements and standards. It does promote and preserve water-related public rights, including access to the waterfront, as well as water-dependent uses. And it will comply with all the engineering standards. Just a little background. The project site is currently in a 25% design. MassDOT is working with the engineering firm AECOM on this, and they are advancing the design now beyond that. So that&#39;s explained in this schedule where we&#39;re, you know, we currently finished a 25% design. By this March, we hope to complete all the permitting for the project. And then starting in March, they&#39;re going to be sending out design build requests for proposals and working with whoever they decide to contract with the project starting in the fall of next year. And then hopefully construction would end in the spring of 2029. So that&#39;s brief presentation on the project. Questions?</td>

And they represent a significant amount of infrastructure expenditures and because of that, from my perspective in terms of ensuring that. that Somerville maintains and increases its vibrancy, the design of the bridge and how it connects to the park, the ADA access, a whole number of different design issues, which we didn&#39;t really look at. I mean, it&#39;s a small little picture where we kind of saw a sketch drawing. If we&#39;re at 25% design, that that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s designed to cost and but we haven&#39;t really seen like conceptual drawings of the of the like the details on the bridges i&#39;ve done a lot of work on pedestrian bridges and this feels like a very very little information but maybe that&#39;s where i started with my first question maybe it&#39;s because the limited realm of our review michael is we can only really look at this aspect of it at which point i&#39;ll uh shove all my comments down and just look at that one aspect so if somebody could elucidate me i&#39;d really appreciate it i&#39;ll let steve start and i can continue with my understanding of the planning board&#39;s role here which is failing i i then i would say my um understanding is it&#39;s very limited as well i understand it&#39;s a</td>

First one is your last one, is that we did notice the summer planning board several actually in early June with the chapter 91 application and its public comment period. So there was an allowance to provide comments back in June. I think it was June 11th through July 11th. for the planning board then. And then put the project in context. We have previously approved by the Conservation Commission for the earlier design, which was pretty well detailed. We have since submitted a notice of intent to the Conservation Commission for the revised design. So it is actually quite detailed now in terms of what&#39;s being proposed. There are engineered drawings available they have been certainly vetted by Massport and others excuse me MassDOT and others and those are currently going through review and approval now along with other submittals to DEP for its water quality certification waterways through the Army Corps they&#39;re reviewing it now so it is at higher level than a typical 25% design. And those are the permits that we are seeking at this time.</td>

I have no doubt that this bridge meets the regulatory requirements. My question is whether or not this bridge is probably going to be hundreds of millions of dollars.

I work in major projects. I think to answer Lynn&#39;s quick question is that we&#39;re going to have a 25% design public hearing. October was technically, it&#39;s scheduled right now for October 21st, next month. So it&#39;ll be a virtual meeting. We&#39;ll get all comments weighed in from the general public. Right now we&#39;re at 25% design. And that&#39;s a design public hearing that&#39;s a requirement for MassDOT with our projects. And we look for any feedback from the public and we take those quite seriously. And then we take those comments and we address those comments to the public. So I think that would ease everybody, the panelists. In other words, we&#39;re not running around here designing something in a shoe box and then just putting it out there. We have a lot of eyes on this. We&#39;re not only working with Somerville, we&#39;re working with Everett and we&#39;re working with others outside of the community as well. So, um, as specific and specifically working with DCR and draw seven park. And I know when you mentioned some stuff with, as far as safety and 88 compliance, and those are the things we&#39;re strongly considering with the bridge like this, from the type of speeds from cyclists. the mode share and everything else on the bridge itself. So all those things are being considered. So at that meeting, when we present the 25% design at the virtual public hearing, which will be held on the 21st, you&#39;ll see all those particulars and be able to weigh in and have your thoughts and your concerns heard. And we take those under consideration in return feedback to those comments. Does that help you?</td>

I think there is a little bit of confusion as to exactly what the planning boards role is in this type of an application, because we haven&#39;t really seen it before and you haven&#39;t done it before.

John Potter, The planning board still has opportunity to make comment, but it just doesn&#39;t have the presentation part of it so it&#39;s a matter of a comment that goes to dp and then gets included or gets looked at as a part of the review that he&#39;s doing that&#39;s.

Done before for for any municipality in the commonwealth. I think we just want some, some, some clarity on exactly what kind of comments we ought to be making and what sort of. Hello that we can that we can give to your project as opposed to generally. I like the, you know. I like the bridge. Yeah, my comment is, I like the bridge. I like the concept of bridge. I think the question that we&#39;re going to have for for the next time that we all convene is how much more than I generally like the bridge. Is appropriate for us to be giving, um. Yeah, so. So, Steve, what I will ask of you is to. Make a request of of the law department to get us a little bit of clarity on exactly what it is that we need to. To do here, just because this is kind of new to new to us and new to the presenters in this specific context. Certainly, because I don&#39;t want to go either above what the planning board is required or expected to do or below. So, if the answer is. We want a formal endorsement of I like the bridge. I&#39;m happy to give it. But if what Lynn, I think is looking at is giving maybe some more detailed advice or questions. I&#39;d like to know if that&#39;s also something that is appropriate and expected in the circumstance.</td>

Sylvia Ilya Sheldahl and Paxton Sheldahl from BOS Urban Architecture. We should also have with us Christian Humania from Offshoots, the landscape architects, and Krista Lucas, who&#39;s the senior engineer from Howardstein Hudson, our traffic engineer. We were last before you on August 21st for this project. I just want to give you a brief Rundown, so in case you don&#39;t remember, that this is regarding the proposed redevelopment of the property known as 675 Somerville Avenue and 3 Craigie Street at that corner. It&#39;s the gas station and auto shop which sits at the corner, and it&#39;s been in the Varelas family for generations. And the proposal is to demolish the existing automotive structures and build a new three-story, 14-unit rental building with commercial space on the first floor in the MR3 with no parking. So at the last hearing, we had several matters that were raised by public comment and by members of the board, we want to just quickly run through those. And then, obviously, we&#39;re here to answer any questions you may have. First up, the abutter to our right on Ibbotson, facing also Somerville Avenue, asked about landscaping and trash and recycling, and we had some discussion about it, but we have some more detail about it now. We did file a slightly updated landscape plan since the last meeting, which PSUF has looked at and said is compliant. Uh, so, uh, Paxton Sylvia and Christian probably can go through that if you want to give them the Sylvia, the opportunity to share her screen, Mr. Carey.</td>

                <td> let me put up my slides and can you confirm that you are seeing a full-size screen please yeah you&#39;re good awesome excellent so pass the baton to paxton for the mouse so he can point and and uh so we go to the next site so we just well first of all good night um Thank you for having us. We are coming back to just clarify a few items and some comments. First item we want to clarify and what we heard from our abutter is a requirement that all commercial deliveries be made by the front entrance on Somerville Avenue rather than through the Egress Alley. We can confirm that that is the intent. The main commercial access and deliveries are going to be off Somerville Avenue. other comment was to ensure that the proposed gate uh in the egress alley has a soft close or a similar feature to reduce noise of entering pedestrians and cyclists and we agree 100 with that comment we&#39;re gonna implement that next um second moving on to trash um the comment was to reconsider the the trash handling plan basically because of the The concern of the barrels, uh, in close proximity to windows and creating disturbances. So we, uh, they want us to, uh, continue to propose the answer solution on. Uh, allowing pick up at the legal address of the residential unit. This is the comment and we have reviewed this with careful consideration in terms of their suggestions. The current residential lobby. with is at a minimum based on Somerville zoning code. The commercial depth is at a minimum based on Somerville zoning code. So any addition of a room, as shown here in red, space to accommodate a two yard, a two cubic yard dumpster, as suggested, would reduce the commercial space of residential lobbies such that it would no longer comply to the zoning demands. So we also Looked at, located where the transformer area, you know, in the back. And we really don&#39;t have the luxury of losing that space for the transformer in our discussions with Eversource. This is really the only place that the transformer can go. And we&#39;re getting power from Craigie. So it can only go on this location. So we contend that placing the trash inside our building away from the abutters property is a viable and sensitive solution. We are not lining up the trash and the recyclables outside of the, you know, in the view of the windows, the recyclables and the trash are going to be fenced and enclosed. So the recycling area is in the back of the egress corridor adjacent to the batter&#39;s parking lot and their own trash recycling area. So this is, we believe, 100% compatible with the current use and it is far away from the existing windows of the unit. So I&#39;m going to now show a little bit more clarity So again, just to clarify again, where the fully enclosed within the building trash area is and where the fully fenced recycling area is. And now we&#39;re going to show some images of what that looks like. So what you see here on the left side is the abutter&#39;s property with the fire escape. You see the limits of our fence that has a soft close. gate and the background behind the bicycles you will see panels those panels are doors that open to basically conceal the trash okay so this is within the building an opaque self-closing door constructed with materials that are compatible with the building next we have a view that shows the approach from Somerville Lab towards our amenities area. And we see the location of the recycling area. And this recycling area is fully fenced with a six feet tall fence that has a self-closing access door and is constructed with materials that are compatible with the building. And then we have another side view of it. Next, you&#39;re going to see it now walking towards the alley. So it&#39;s pretty, pretty concealed, right? Next, we have a view of the conditions, right, adjacent to that recycling area on the property and it&#39;s not to point out other than we&#39;re right next to that. And so we&#39;re kind of in a compatible zone with the way that the trash and the recycling is being handled on their side. And I just want to point out that what we&#39;re doing is less impactful on the abutters than the current situation on the property. Here we just want to, we heard also to remove the proposed fencing that spans the length of our building to ensure unobstructed use of the fire escape and allow for proper maintenance and access and that we should allow fencing along the backyard property line and that&#39;s going to sit on top of the drainage barrier where it does not interfere with safety or access. We agree, we have PB, Lupita D Montoya- You know, we&#39;re going to clarify that our that was an older plan that probably we&#39;re looking at, but that this is the proposed. PB, Lupita D Montoya- expense of that fence, which is pushed back so that it does not interfere with the landing of the fire escape and that is no barrier there. And then, furthermore, there were other comments about runoff, water runoff, so we want to just make sure that there is a continuous curve to prevent water runoff and that at the landing there will be a drain to address any kind of water there that will go towards Alex&#39;s property. So this is a view of the alley. And we just want to clarify a couple of things here. The 10 foot wide egress corridor serves two purposes. First, the distance This distance, the 10 feet, allows the existing non-fire rated construction of the abutter to remain as is. There&#39;s no additional fire risks based on the building code to that adjacent property, but maintaining distance for distance. In addition, the unprotected openings, windows, are allowed to remain as is because of this distance. So second, this serves as an egress corridor, obviously. Any reduction of width would have to be limited to the minimum egress width allowed. and approved by the Santa Barbara Fire Department for planting in the egress path. So there was a comment about providing planting along the egress path and over the brick wall. So we would not recommend installing a living wall here because it is just simply too dark. There&#39;s not a lot of sunlight on that wall. We need to keep it clear for the abutters emergency egress as much as we can. And of course, during off seasons. And then to clarify that we&#39;re kind of pointing out that red rectangle over there, that trench linear drain right at the property bank will take any water that reaches that threshold inward towards Alex property. This is the point where the curb is the shallowest because it is the landing for the egress. Okay. And now I think Krista, if you can talk about your findings with the curb cut.</td>

                <td> Oh, thank you, Sylvia. Krista Crane-Lucas with Howardstein-Hudson. I&#39;m the senior transportation engineer working on this project. The project coordinated curbside uses and restrictions with the mobility division. So as we discussed last time, we&#39;re closing the three curb cuts, two on Somerville Ave, one on Craigie Street. As part of this project, the project submitted a transportation access plan, or TAP, The TAP consists of narrative and plans that get submitted to the city to review and illustrate access to the building by people walking, rolling, biking, and driving. There is no more driving here. And so we also identify any transportation and streetscape improvements associated with the project. So the designated loading zone is proposed to serve typical deliveries like USPS, FedEx and UPS. And the project recognizes, though, the board&#39;s concerns for double parking in the Somerville bike lane. So we followed up with Justin Schreiber and the Mobility Division and have good news. The Mobility Division, actually, the city of Somerville has a quick build project on Somerville Avenue. that they&#39;re working to install. They&#39;re going to create protected bike lanes in both directions on Somerville Avenue by moving the bike lanes next to the sidewalk curb and adding new buffered areas with barriers between vehicles or parking lanes. So they&#39;re going to swap the parking and the bike lane is how it sounds. So these improvements will address the double parking concern because it&#39;s going to swap where the bikes and the parking are and will also be constructed before this project is complete. So that&#39;s some good news for the Board. Also, all regulations, including what we currently proposed in the TAP, will need to go to the Traffic Commission for approval. So, though I know the Board was hoping to have kind of an Uber-Lyft drop-off area, we will continue to work with the Mobility Division for the final curbside restrictions along these curbs because Because things may change between the time of approval and when the property actually goes in. So again, we&#39;re happy to continue to coordinate with Mobility on what they want and what the Traffic Commission wants in this area, making sure that everything works out for everyone, keeps things safe. And I believe that a condition has been included within that that includes such language to which I refer to Adam.</td>

                <td> Justin Cappos- Thanks, Krista. Yeah, I mean mobility basically suggested that we condition this issue, and there is a condition requiring us to coordinate with mobility, which we, of course, will do. Justin Cappos- I think the last issue that came up, because I think we&#39;ve addressed all the other ones that came up last time, came from the planning board, a member about whether we could include a three-bedroom unit. I would note that we are not proposing that. It would put the applicant in the position of not meeting the various criteria for the special site plan approval and the special permit, namely meeting the intent and purpose of the MR3 zone per zoning ordinance 4.1.3.D. The purpose is to create dwelling unit type sizes and bedroom counts for smaller households and general buildings, which is what we have. So we are not proposing three bedroom units because that&#39;s I think the point of what we&#39;re trying to do here I would note this is a relatively small building of under 15,000 square feet and actually of that Only it&#39;s about 12,000 is residential. The rest is commercial So there&#39;s only 14 units in a relatively small three-story building if we were had an 80 unit building in the mr6 We&#39;d have a very different conversation, but that&#39;s not what we have in front of us today. I so this project meets all of the site plan approval and special permit criteria and is a major improvement over the fully paved existing automotive use as can be seen from the 16 written comments you&#39;ve since received in favor in addition to the favorable comments at the last planning board meeting it is fully dimensionally compliant it is sustainable it is complementary to the neighborhood and it is transit oriented The applicant hopes the planning board would graciously grant us an approval of the relief requested this evening. Thank you.</td>

I think this project is fantastic and I think it&#39;s going to be um a real asset towards the the kind of the re-envisioning of somerville f interestingly i was on somerville on my bike uh and at cambria hotel there was um two ubers parked in the bike lane forcing me out into the into the traffic and i was like see this is exactly what i was saying um but i guess my comment isn&#39;t directed towards the applicant team but rather to the city Stephen, I don&#39;t know, I just want to go on the record on this, in that we as a city are trying to shift how people move from having their own personal cars to bike, walk, transit, etc. And and Michael, a great example of this is, you know, this is conditioned with, you know, they&#39;re not going to be able to a residents not to have parking permits. I believe then very strongly that it&#39;s incumbent upon the city. That it&#39;s the city&#39;s responsibility, not the applicant&#39;s responsibility to ensure. that we are doing what we need to be doing to help facilitate that kind of non solo car travel. So we talk about UPS and Lyft and whatnot. There&#39;s six houses on my street. My desk looks out over it. and just six houses, not 14, but just six units. And you see the steady stream of Amazon, FedEx, the mail delivery, Uber, et cetera, for six units. So having, and again, this we, and I love that we, Adam, that you said that you&#39;ll continue to coordinate with mobility, but I would, I want to go on the record saying that I think the city needs to be proactive. And when we&#39;re having, Something more than, say, 3 or 5 units built that we build in that 1 or 2 parking spaces will be allocated for 15 minute parking drop off. Like, what can we do to help facilitate non single single use vehicle use? So. I, Krista, I saw that report article that&#39;s coming out on the rebuild of Elm, Craigie and Somerville. You summarized it perfectly. So in this particular case, I think we&#39;re where we need to be. I just think moving forward, the city probably needs to institutionalize where we can have these drop off zones. So it&#39;s more of a partnership kind of going into it that you&#39;re not stuck at a board meeting with me saying, what about the bikes? Thank you. So, less of a question more of a statement.</td>

Oh, goodness. 2 and a half years ago back in March of 2024 and some things have occurred along the way is we&#39;re used to this 4th key. uh elements for this evening number one a revision to the unit count and unit type mix uh revisions to the floor plans the building exterior and design revisions as well as the bicycle parking uh this was originally going to be 15 units it is now 13. so Mathematically, that would have been 3 affordable units that now goes to 2.6. So the applicant will have to pay a fractional share to the city. As it&#39;s not an even number, but I just thought I would bring that out. I&#39;m going to ask now that Tanya. Carrier has put together a slide show. I think it&#39;s best we go through that and then we can discuss questions and concerns from the board. Thank you.</td>

                <td> Good evening. Tanya Carrier from CULSA Design. Just confirming you can see my screen. Yes. Okay. All right. So I&#39;ll give a short presentation. I have some before and afters just to show exactly what changed or what we are proposing to change this evening. So here&#39;s a brief summary. The main change that we faced was that the basement that was formerly proposed became infeasible. unfeasible, the groundwater levels were shown to be too high and shoring the foundation was going to be quite difficult, given the proximity to the existing buildings adjacent to the site. So our change is to eliminate the basement level. Originally, the bike storage and mechanical area was in that level. So this would allow us to bring the bike storage room up to grade level, providing easier access for using the bikes. And with that change is where our unit count change. Basically, the two ground floor units would be eliminated for those changes. Additional changes are to the fifth story. We changed a two-bedroom unit to a one-bedroom unit, and this was in order to provide a new common lounge area for the resident use, with also two roof decks to provide some outdoor amenity space for a common area in the building. And these roof decks are also intended to replace six eliminated balconies. The electrical wires were quite close to the building on Bow Street Place side. So Eversource has asked us to eliminate those balconies on that side to provide the proper clearance. And then on the exterior design, the balconies is the main change, replacing those with the shared roof deck. And then we have a minor change to the restaurant entry door um which you&#39;ll see in a moment and on the bow street side a minor change to the material of that area so let&#39;s just get right into the plans um so above is our previously approved basement plan at the top and then first floor so you can see our basement had the bike parking and mechanical area with eliminating the basement from the scope of work we would now move the bike room up to grade level have a mechanical at the end of the building And also have our our trash room reconfigured so that our vestibule could remain in the Center with this change, we were able to slightly increase the commercial area, providing a more usable space that might be easier to lease in that sit vacant and that was kind of the main change for the first floor. On the fifth floor. Karen Hollweg, Previously approved, we had one large unit large two bedroom unit that took up the whole floor and had three private decks what we&#39;ve changed is we&#39;ve made that into a smaller unit, which is more fitting. Karen Hollweg, To the building and comparable to the other units in the building and we have a common residential area which has two common decks where residents in any unit can go out to enjoy the the green roof and kind of the fifth floor area. OSBT-Karen Hollweg- Now on both street place elevation above is our previously approved, where you see, we had nine total balconies. OSBT-Karen Hollweg- What we are proposing now is to keep the three that are not too close to the power lines. OSBT-Karen Hollweg- Just to the left of the page and eliminate the other six balconies. OSBT-Karen Hollweg- On both streets side. OSBT-Karen Hollweg- This side of the building is adjacent to the existing yellow. HAB-Juliette Boone, Two and a half story building here and then adjacent to that there&#39;s even a taller building so it&#39;s going to have very low visibility, so what we did was we wrapped the brick. HAB-Juliette Boone, In our new proposal, instead of having break the entire length we wrapped it to where the massing breaks, providing a nice visual break and change that to a semanticious panel. HAB-Juliette Boone, And this is a very minor change to the. commercial space. This rendering was very schematic. Once we got into structural design with the engineer, we&#39;re needing supporting posts here. So we thought we would frame this out with a nice brick detailing accent at the commercial area, and it really highlights the entry. And for our summary of original unit count and bedroom counts and proposed, Originally we had 15 proposed total units. Now we have 13. And two bedrooms, we had three. Now we have two. One bedroom stayed the same at nine, and studios decreased from three to two. And that&#39;s our presentation. We&#39;d like to turn it over in case HAB-Juliette Boone, Oh, I do have one additional it&#39;s not in the slideshow but today was added that the ever so it was added to the staff memo last minute that ever source needs to provide. HAB-Juliette Boone, approval of the location before the before the planning board could consider approving the project, so I did pull that up, we have worked with every source and on this design for the transformer vault on both street place and receive that work order number. So, that is all set there as well. So, I&#39;ll turn it over. So we have time for questions.</td>

                <td>Okay, thank you very much. So. Tanya and team, it seems to me the way you were describing it is a lot of the revisions were derived from that that that basement level that is is going to flood and the. Balcony space that isn&#39;t necessarily going to be feasible to build the way you thought it was. So that required some reconfiguration of of the outdoor space of the building. Do I do I have that? Right? That&#39;s that&#39;s how I think I understood your presentation. I just want to make sure I&#39;m thinking about it in the right way.</td>
