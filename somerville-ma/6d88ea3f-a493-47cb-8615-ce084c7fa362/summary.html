<h3 id="4-chapter-91-request-and-presentation-mystic-river-bridge">4. Chapter 91 Request and Presentation - Mystic River Bridge</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Presenters:</strong><ul>
<li>Richard Jarba, MassDOT and DCR</li>
<li>William Conroy, MassDOT Project Manager</li>
<li>Melissa Lenker, MassDOT</li>
<li>Dick Grotenhaus, AECOM (Designer)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Project Description:</strong> Proposed bicycle-pedestrian bridge over the Mystic River, connecting DCR Draw 7 Park (Somerville side) and the Encore Casino area (Everett side).<ul>
<li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To provide public benefits and access to communities along the Mystic River.</li>
<li><strong>Ownership/Operation:</strong> MassDOT will manage contracting and permitting; DCR will own and operate the bridge.</li>
<li><strong>Design:</strong> Supported by five piers (three in the river), V-arches, and a steel arch over the center span. The bridge will be 18 feet wide clear (increased from an original 12 feet).</li>
<li><strong>Location:</strong> Crosses the Mystic River between Draw 7 Park and the Encore site.</li>
<li><strong>Compliance:</strong> Chapter 91 compliance is required due to its location in filled tidelands and flow tidelands. The project aims to promote public access, maintain navigable waterways, comply with fill and structure requirements, and preserve water-related public rights.</li>
<li><strong>Schedule:</strong><ul>
<li>25% design completed.</li>
<li>Permitting completion: March 2026.</li>
<li>Design-build RFP issuance: March 2026.</li>
<li>Construction start: Fall 2026.</li>
<li>Construction end: Spring 2029.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Lynn Richards</strong> questioned the Planning Board's role, particularly regarding design review, given the project's scale and potential impact on Somerville's vibrancy. She noted the limited design information presented.</li>
<li><strong>Steve Carey</strong> and <strong>Michael Capuano</strong> acknowledged the limited role of the Planning Board, primarily for endorsement of compliance with state regulations.</li>
<li><strong>Richard Jarba</strong> clarified that the Chapter 91 application and public comment period were initiated in June, and detailed engineered drawings are available and under review by DEP and the Army Corps. He also noted that the Somerville Planning Board previously went through a similar process for the Draw 7 Park Chapter 91 license.</li>
<li><strong>William Conroy (MassDOT)</strong> stated that a 25% design public hearing is scheduled for October 21st, 2025, where the public can provide feedback on the design, including ADA compliance and safety for cyclists. He also noted this is the first time MassDOT has sought a Chapter 91 sign-off from a planning board.</li>
<li><strong>Dirk Grotenhaus (AECOM)</strong> clarified that the Planning Board has the option to solicit comments for DEP waterways.</li>
<li><strong>Michael Capuano</strong> requested clarification from the city's legal department regarding the specific role and scope of comments the Planning Board should provide for a Chapter 91 project, given its novelty for both the Board and MassDOT.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Motion:</strong> Michael Capuano moved to continue this agenda item to September 18th, 2025, pending legal clarification of the Planning Board's role.</li>

<h3 id="5-major-amendment-request-675-somerville-avenue-and-3-craigie-street-zp24-000099-zp24-000098">5. Major Amendment Request - 675 Somerville Avenue and 3 Craigie Street (ZP24-000099 &amp; ZP24-000098)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Applicant:</strong> 675 Somerville LLC</li>
<li><strong>Representatives:</strong><ul>
<li>Adam Dash, Attorney, 48 Grove Street, Somerville</li>
<li>Alexander Varelis, 675 Somerville LLC</li>
<li>Sylvia Ilya Sheldahl, BOS Urban Architecture</li>
<li>Paxton Sheldahl, BOS Urban Architecture</li>
<li>Christian Humania, Offshoots (Landscape Architects)</li>
<li>Krista Lucas, Howardstein Hudson (Traffic Engineer)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Project Description:</strong> Proposed redevelopment of the property at 675 Somerville Avenue and 3 Craigie Street. Demolition of existing gas station and auto shop to construct a new three-story, 14-unit rental building with commercial space on the first floor in the MR3 zoning district, with no parking.</li>
<li><strong>Previous Meeting:</strong> August 21st, 2025.</li>
<li><strong>Key Revisions/Responses to Previous Comments:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Commercial Deliveries:</strong> All commercial deliveries will be made via the Somerville Avenue front entrance, not the egress alley.</li>
<li><strong>Egress Alley Gate:</strong> The proposed gate in the egress alley will have a soft-close feature to reduce noise.</li>
<li><strong>Trash Handling:</strong><ul>
<li>The applicant reviewed suggestions for a two-cubic-yard dumpster but found it infeasible due to zoning requirements for commercial and residential lobby sizes.</li>
<li>The transformer location in the back is fixed due to Eversource requirements and power source from Craigie Street.</li>
<li>Proposed solution: Fully enclosed trash area within the building and a fully fenced recycling area in the back of the egress corridor, adjacent to the abutter's parking lot. This is deemed compatible and less impactful than the current situation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Fencing:</strong> The proposed fencing along the building's length has been removed to ensure unobstructed use and maintenance of the fire escape. Fencing will be along the backyard property line on top of the drainage barrier, not interfering with safety or access.</li>
<li><strong>Water Runoff:</strong> A continuous curb will prevent water runoff, and a drain at the egress landing will direct water towards the property.</li>
<li><strong>Egress Path Planting:</strong> A living wall is not recommended due to insufficient sunlight and the need to keep the path clear for emergency egress.</li>
<li><strong>Curb Cuts &amp; Loading Zone:</strong><ul>
<li>Three curb cuts (two on Somerville Ave, one on Craigie Street) will be closed.</li>
<li>A designated loading zone is proposed for typical deliveries (USPS, FedEx, UPS).</li>
<li><strong>Krista Lucas</strong> reported that the Mobility Division is implementing a "quick build" project on Somerville Avenue to create protected bike lanes by swapping parking and bike lane locations, which will address double-parking concerns before this project's completion.</li>
<li>All regulations and the Transportation Access Plan (TAP) will go to the Traffic Commission for approval.</li>
<li>The project will continue to coordinate with the Mobility Division for final curbside restrictions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Unit Mix:</strong> The applicant is not proposing three-bedroom units, as the current mix aligns with the MR3 zone's purpose for smaller households (Zoning Ordinance 4.1.3.D).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Planning Board Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Lynn Richards</strong> commended the detailed response to concerns, particularly regarding traffic. She emphasized the city's responsibility to proactively facilitate non-solo car travel, suggesting institutionalizing drop-off zones for developments with more than 3-5 units.</li>
<li><strong>Luc Schuster</strong> expressed support for the project, noting the thoughtful responses to previous questions.</li>
<li><strong>Michael Capuano</strong> thanked the applicant for the presentation and addressing concerns, calling it a "really good project" and a "great improvement to the neighborhood and city."</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Motions:</strong><ol>
<li><strong>Motion:</strong> Michael Capuano moved to approve, with the conditions outlined in the staff memorandum, the site plan approval to develop a general building in the district.<ul>
<li><strong>Second:</strong> Jahan Habib</li>
<li><strong>Vote:</strong><ul>
<li>Jahan Habib: Aye</li>
<li>Lynn Richards: Aye</li>
<li>Luc Schuster: Aye</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Outcome:</strong> The site plan approval was <strong>approved</strong> (4-0-0).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Motion:</strong> Michael Capuano moved to approve, with the conditions outlined in the staff memorandum, the request to establish a residential housing use in the zoning district.<ul>

<li><strong>Michael Capuano</strong> requested that staff (Madison) review the Eversource confirmation to ensure it meets the city's requirements.</li>
<li><strong>Ilan Sassoon</strong> clarified that the provided work order number with an engineering stamp is Eversource's standard confirmation of an approved design plan.</li>
