Is there any discussion? I see no discussion. Let&#39;s table that. We&#39;ll lay that on the table to take up at the end of the meeting, along with the anticipated motion to adjourn. And then we had a request from the administration to take item three on the agenda out of order. Kirk, if you could scroll up to item three so folks can see that. If there&#39;s no objection, we will take item three out of order. Seeing none, item three is 25-0989. that the Commissioner of Public Works appear before the Special Committee on School Building Facilities and Maintenance to discuss the recent break-in at the Winter Hill School Building and the measures being taken to secure the building. Chair Baton, do you want any background or, I mean, this is somewhat self-explanatory, but before we turn it over to the administration for their update report on this, anything you want to...</td>

                <td> Yeah. Contacts you want to share? Thank you, Chair Davis. This item appeared all over the news. Suffice it to say, last month, I believe it was, emergency crews reported to the Winter Hill at Sycamore Street, the old building that is now closed and is unoccupied and to which access is presumably precluded. The emergency responders were responding to reports of smoke and several small fires apparently had been set off by people inside the building. So that is obviously a concern not only for the welfare of the people who may have entered inappropriately, but also for the for the safety of the neighborhood and for those emergency responders. So, you know, I don&#39;t know anything beyond what has been reported by the city and in the media. So I&#39;m certainly looking forward to any additional information that can be provided. In addition, I think it raises some serious questions about how we are ensuring that people can stay safely away from the building because it is not supposed to be occupied for various safety concerns. So that is the reason the school building is closed now. The students are relocated to the Edgerly building. And we want to be able to use that site in the future and not have additional problems happening there. So that&#39;s the only background I have. Turn it back over to you, Chair Davis.</td>

                <td> Yes, Commissioner Jill Lathan. Thank you for this opportunity, committee and Mr. Chair. And thank you for the opportunity to present some facts of the situation. This is going to be a factual account, not based on injunction or reception. So actually what happened was there was a malfunctioning door alarm, malfunction communication error on the 9th of May for that building. It was a door alarm. So that required us to put in an IT help ticket for them to come to try and resolve this communication error to the door alarms for that building. Since IT was going to have to contact and reach out to Verizon and get this kind of set up and fixed, DPW decided that we would go in frequently every single day until that door alarm was actually to make sure that that building was safe and secure. So it was because of our daily checks and our frequent checks because of the door alarm communication error, that&#39;s how we actually found these smothering fires. If it was not for DPW doing these checks, frequent checks because of a communication error for the door alarm, this could have been a much larger and significantly worse off situation for not only the building, but the neighborhood. So I want to thank my DPW custodians and crews for doing their due diligence and doing these regular checks because of this doing wrong issue. We were there. We smelled smoke. We immediately called the response, the fire department, and they responded. That&#39;s when police fire responded to the scene. I had my custodians in there actually stomping out fires and using fire extinguishers. I was waiting for the fire department to get there. They were smothering kind of little pocket fire, vandalism fires that some folks had set. We immediately following that, you know, make sure that there&#39;s some windows that were open. maybe busted in or cracked open. We&#39;ve worked with the school department. Food service goes in there regularly in the mornings. We&#39;ve worked with them about making sure that doors aren&#39;t propped up and open while they&#39;re in there to make sure that the building&#39;s soon secure. IT has, you know, then the IT came and finally had gotten fixed the door lock systems. And then as of the 13th, the security was, the door locks were fully functional again as of May 13th. So just to wrap it up, May 9th, there was a communication error with the door alarm. We mainly notified IT, which we had to get Verizon involved. So that was on Thursday, I believe. So Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, we were doing regular checks on the building. Monday the 12th was when we were doing our regular checks. That&#39;s when we noticed the actual smoke in the building and notified the proper authorities. The next day on the 13th, IT was able to fix that system and the door launched and fully functioned as of the 13th. So that&#39;s kind of the factual events of what happened. Again, thank you to DPW for being able to clearly take care of what they need to do and be in that building and actually see the smoke.</td>

I guess two really, you said that there was a door alarm And so your DPW folks were going in regularly, which I appreciate and certainly sounds like that may have been a significant factor in avoiding something worse. So was the door alarm issue such that the door wouldn&#39;t then lock? Do I understand that correctly?</td>

                <td>Mr. Chair, it was because the door alarm, if the door was forced open or if something was, the door alarm wouldn&#39;t have triggered. So somehow they forced the entry into that building so that the door alarm didn&#39;t get triggered. So anytime you try and force a door open, you&#39;ll have an alarm go off. Notice that there&#39;s children trying to enter the building or they&#39;re in the building. That happens with all of our buildings and school buildings. If you go to one of our buildings and try and get into that building, the alarm will sound. And that&#39;s how we get notified immediately that there&#39;s someone either in the building or trying to get into the building.</td>

This is what I was told. So basically, they are using that part of the cafeteria. And I haven&#39;t been told how we thought... the individuals got in, I think it was still thought that it was a window. So I really, I felt really good about things. But now it just seems like there&#39;s even more confusion. And I&#39;m just but, but, you know, the fact that we, I believe we have motion sensors in the building that happened to be down for for a technical reason. allowed for these kids to mess around the building. They threw paint all around and lit a couple pieces of paper on fire. But definitely don&#39;t want to see that happening, continue to happen. So I&#39;ve been in contact with DPW, and it seems like the building is secure. That&#39;s all.</td>

And so for that reason, there is limited storage that is used at the Winter Hill and the spaces of the building that are safe for people to continue to access. But if there&#39;s additional information needed, I just don&#39;t want to say anything that&#39;s inaccurate and I can bring that back at another time.</td>

We&#39;re in punch list on that. Everything is operational. We&#39;ve just got a few tidying up to do. That will be complete within the next couple of weeks. Once the students are out, we are actually going to have a formal training session with the food service staff on the new equipment, which is just part of the contract. Frankly, they already know how to use it and have been using it, but it is an item. And it&#39;s my understanding that once we have that and the school year is done, they will move all the remaining items that they will be using over the summer or possibly next year to the Argenziano. And I suspect that they won&#39;t need to access the Sycamore Street building much past late June, early July.</td>

You know, like the old high school building, the 1895 building, I think has a status of like nobody&#39;s allowed in there. The Cummings has this curious status, which I don&#39;t always quite understand where we&#39;re using it and not using it at some capacity. So in any way that we can just at least formally articulate what the status of a building is, what that means and who has access to it, I think would just be helpful in general. But it&#39;s not something I need to have answered in detail right now.</td>

                <td>Sure, to the chair. It can be confusing because we do have various different statuses. The 1895 cannot be occupied by anyone because it doesn&#39;t have any life safety items. It doesn&#39;t have heating, cooling. It only has partial electric. It doesn&#39;t have plumbing. And frankly, there&#39;s a lot of dangerous conditions in the building. So there&#39;s a prohibition on sort of occupancy of that building. The Cummings has very limited use for construction personnel who are safety trained. It does have heat. It never had cooling. It does have heat. It has a lot of code deficiencies that would preclude it from serving as a school at this point. So were we to reoccupy it as a school, inspectional services would require a large number of code updates to use it for that purpose. The Sycamore Street building has life safety and It&#39;s fine, particularly in the area where food services have been in and out in storage. There are no issues around that occupation there. from a code perspective, I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s anything that would preclude us from using it. However, from a condition perspective, once we moved the students out of that building, we continued doing our testing in advance of the assessment of the building reconstruction. And at that point, honestly, we didn&#39;t care what condition we left it in. We did a lot of destructive testing. And then there were some issues with some water damage that required some remediation. So the building is not pleasant to be in. There would be a lot of work that would need to be done to reoccupy the building, but it is not an unsafe building from sort of a life safety perspective. So again, we don&#39;t currently have any projected uses for it. Were we to try to reoccupy it, there&#39;s a lot of, i don&#39;t want to call it cosmetic but you know just work that would need to be done in terms of walls and things like that um so that&#39;s really not on on the table right now but it&#39;s not an unsafe building as opposed to the the 1895 which is an unsafe building right now miss baton further questions thank you just a follow-up thank you for that clarification</td>

I doubt your staff, Commissioner Lathan, are going in to that building on a regular basis. And I could be wrong, but how do we assure and how frequently do we check that people are not entering, that there are not people residing in the buildings or getting in there when they shouldn&#39;t be?</td>

                <td> Yeah, so the chair, that&#39;s a great question. So 1895 is a different sort of category. We&#39;re not, that&#39;s, I am kind of working with that building. But we do have buildings that are closed, that are sometimes used, like non-school buildings. For example, we have 19 Walnut Street that is not used, occupied, it&#39;s used for storage, for parks and recreation. It is alarmed with both the door alarms and motion sensors. So, you know, if anything would get triggered, we&#39;d be meeting to go over there. But we do do you know, random checks in our buildings. We try and do it, you know, frequently, depending on the location, especially, you know, with that 19 Walnut Street, just for an example, you know, how that&#39;s located. We have to kind of frequently check that at least, you know, nightly or every other night, depending on the weather conditions to make sure that that&#39;s, you know, airtight and secure. There&#39;s no one that&#39;s broken in to try and to live there and things like that. So there&#39;s not a lot of buildings that we have that are like this, but That&#39;s just one of our examples. Some buildings that are not occupied by anything, because as Mitch said, they can&#39;t be, those may not be checked as frequently because the systems aren&#39;t in place to kind of trigger something. But, you know, I have nighttime custodians and nighttime supervisors that go and kind of look at all of our buildings throughout the night.</td>

The door thing broke, which then broke the motion sensors, which happened to be the same night that some kids maybe went through the window. All the windows have been secured. Everything&#39;s buttoned up. There&#39;s been wood put over where there was a broken window. But these motion sensors will go off if anybody moves around the building. So, you know, like I said, I feel safe. I feel secure that the, I feel good that the building is secure and I do appreciate the DBW going in that building because, you know, when a building&#39;s not in use, you know, they, they, you know, they break down things that, you know, or, or some, or nobody&#39;s there to notice like a leak or something like that.

I did get some concerns from different individuals asking me why didn&#39;t the fire alarm system notify us? And that&#39;s a great question. The fire alarm system was functioning. However, the system that&#39;s in the school is protected by heat detectors, not smoke detectors. So the fires that were set in the building did not create the amount of heat that would have been required to set those detectors off. So the system is functioning. However, the size of the fires in the building did not rise to the level to trip the alarm. If they were not discovered by the DPW when they were, they no doubt would have grown to the point where they would have eventually tripped the fire alarm system.</td>

                <td>Yeah, absolutely. I&#39;ll take chief any day. That sounds good. So this is a longstanding request from students and educators at the Healy School. the the cafetorium uh combination cafeteria auditorium uh is a large space in the healy school and the walls as i understand it are concrete and when you pack a ton of kids into a concrete box and everyone starts know socializing that room can get extremely loud and some of our students especially those with sensory issues find that space to be very difficult to be in And so the request has been to install soundproofing materials on the walls to ensure that more students, I&#39;m not going to say every student will be able to be in there, because as I said, lunchrooms are, you know, hectic places, but at least to be a more welcoming environment for most of our students. So this is something that we&#39;re trying to do. PTAs and administration advocated for for many years under Superintendent Mary Skipper and then Interim Superintendent Jeff Curley and again, it&#39;s something that popped up on the has popped up on the list to be addressed in the current administration and so I believe at some point it had been agreed to, although I don&#39;t have the history on that. And yet this is still something that I think, you know, I don&#39;t know what the cost would be, but I think improving the conditions for our kids in this building, putting up fabric tiles in this space to make the acoustics more welcoming would be very much in our interest to better serve the kids in that school. So that is the request. And certainly happy to hear any updates that administration has on that.</td>

So at the beginning of each school year, the mayor&#39;s office, along with SPS administration, DPW, IAM, and SPS principals do walkthroughs of each school building. The last walkthrough would have been in September, and it resulted in a list of priorities. An example of the top three were a new classroom at the Argenziano, the new commercial kitchen at the Argenziano, and the science room at the Healy School, which I think this committee has already heard a lot about under different items. The soundproofing of the cafetorium was not identified during the walkthrough. If at this point it is being identified as a priority, we will work through our typical channels to get a better sense of the ask and propose solutions.</td>

So I appreciate you all bringing it to my attention so I can help advocate as well. We&#39;re not privy to those walkthroughs, but happy to help advocate. I actually, when I saw this order, I thought you meant in between the cafetorium and the gymnasium, because if you&#39;ve ever had a meeting at nighttime in the cafetorium, the sneakers squeaking and all the stuff happening can be pretty disruptive to whatever meeting or activities going on. But yeah, no, I am full and full support and happy to help in any way I can. And thanks for bringing this to my attention.</td>

I do think that this is a priority for the Healy. It has been for many years. I also don&#39;t think this scales at the same level as perhaps building a classroom or, you know, the production kitchen, these sorts of things that are our major infrastructure projects at a school. And, you know, I understand we need to learn a little more about this, but what I&#39;m envisioning for this and Director Raish can slap me over the head if I&#39;m wrong, but is that it&#39;s simply, you know, installing soundproofing tiles in an existing space. Oh, there he is, raised his hand to slap me. But yeah, I mean, so in my mind, this is not raised to be a major infrastructure project. In my mind, it&#39;s a more medium or minor infrastructure project, but I&#39;m happy to be corrected. Mr. Raich, if you&#39;d like to speak, I welcome the input.</td>

                <td>Yeah. Thank you for bringing this to our attention, Chair Baton. And you articulated very well the impacts of those loud noises in confined spaces with children. As you might recall, last summer, we did acoustic treatments throughout the Edgerly for the active use of the Winter Hill there. And I&#39;ve had several comments from parents, teachers, and the administrative staff at Winter Hill at Edgerly at what a huge difference that has made in it. Um, so I think this is a, it&#39;s a, it&#39;s a great item. Um, it&#39;s unfortunate that it was not brought to our attention, um, at the beginning of this school year when we walked, you know, uh, Commissioner Latham and I walked every school and including the, the Healy with the principal and Chief of Staff Anna Soke. Um, but it&#39;s, it&#39;s in the pipeline now. We&#39;ve got it on our spreadsheet. Um, and, uh, it&#39;s, it&#39;s, I think you&#39;re, you&#39;re right. You know, the, the acoustic treatment, um, and, and for, uh, to clear up, uh, councilor Clingan&#39;s confusion, the, the, um, more appropriate term is acoustic treatment rather than soundproofing. Um, soundproofing would be like a resilient wall between the gym and the acoustic treatments are more like what you see behind me.</td>

                <td>Thank you, through you. I appreciate and I&#39;m glad Mr. Petone is going to follow up with administration because obviously it has to be deemed a priority in that perspective, although we may have constituents bringing it up and I hope that has an impact on the priority decision. I don&#39;t think it should be directed from this group. I will, I did kind of do a little searching online and I did see that in the Healy 2021 school improvement plan, there was something stated that there had been a commitment to do soundproofing in the following year. So it was definitely something that I knew was on the agenda at one point. Clearly, we didn&#39;t hold ourselves accountable to it. Could have been because of other really pressing items that happened with the edgerly and the Winter Hill. So we all recognize that maybe this is something that got dropped down on the list. So I don&#39;t think anything here is a critique. I appreciate that it&#39;s going to be vetted through the administration, both the city and the schools. And I do think as a parent who had both of our kids at the Healy, it is... a really difficult experience to have any kind of event of any kind in the cafetorium, including lunch. It is very loud and it&#39;s very uncomfortable. And there are populations of students who don&#39;t eat lunch in the cafeteria. I mean, the city would have a better assessment on whether or not this cafeteria in particular is much louder than the other ones. But other ones, they do have sound baffling and different things. So any kind of acoustic treatment that can be done would be very much appreciated. And I hope that we invest in the long run in this space better. That generation of buildings are wonderful. I know there&#39;s some real, we&#39;ve really benefited from the design of those buildings, but the sound in particular has been problematic. So I just wanted to chime in that I did see reference to the fact that it was supposed to happen and it was referenced in the 21 school improvement plan that there was a commitment to do this work. Thank you.</td>

It was a big issue and concern. in kind of the first generation of this meeting when former city councilor Beatriz Gomez and I were the co-chairs and there was a great deal of progress made on this and there was work done on creating kind of a detailed database and that was demonstrated with this committee. The person who designed that database has since left the district. I understand. I mean, the city, I could be wrong, but this is my understanding. And I thought it was a good time to sort of check in because it doesn&#39;t seem like we&#39;ve come up with a way to figure out how to put the highest level information. We recognize that not every sensor, not every... Changing of whatever we do on these buildings has to be public, unless obviously if somebody puts a request for information, but creating a celebrating the work that we&#39;re doing and then being public about that as a celebration, but also continuing to build the confidence in the city, the city community. resonance that we know this work is being done. So I thought it was good timing to sort of say, let&#39;s check in what&#39;s happened with that work. What are the thoughts about being more public about this information and the progress? And if we don&#39;t have a full report, I get it, but I&#39;m just curious what the status of that is.</td>

So it could track actions that have been taken to address a system. So let&#39;s say the boiler And when was the boiler serviced? When is the next planned boiler date? Different components of the boiler. So the burners in the boiler or the pipe fittings, when had each been checked? So each item, they had kind of parent-child relationships in this database. And I&#39;m now reaching the limits of my understanding of what had been built, but it looked like a fairly robust product. And to Ms. Pitone&#39;s point, this product doesn&#39;t, we haven&#39;t heard anything more about that great work that had happened. And so just to sort of separate that from the 311, very valuable 311 collaboration that&#39;s happening between the city and the school department, this I think is looking a little more proactively about what the planning is. So just as a matter of clarification, and I&#39;m happy to share the recording that Ms. Patone had forwarded to me to anyone who would like to review that. I see Mr. Raich has come on screen, Mr. Raich.</td>

And the software then takes it to the next level and allows us to program in automated work orders based on what your preventative maintenance schedule will be. It will also interface with the 311 queue alert system. The idea is that QAlert and 311 is very well established for a broad range of things in the city and will continue to be managed by constituent services. And 311 is part of constituent services. But the two software programs will interface and give us a lot more ability to perform preventive maintenance, react to 311 requests, and then also report out on them. I guess the good news is that we had a lot of interest on our request for proposals. We had 22 submissions. The bad news is that we have 22 submissions to review. We are in the process of doing that and we&#39;ll be narrowing it down. We hope to narrow it down to a manageable number. I&#39;m hoping around three to bring in four interviews and it&#39;ll be kind of two stage interview. One talking with sort of the DPW staff as well as the water and sewer staff and the engineering on sort of the backend work order. management and then also talk with Steve Craig and 311 on the interface with how well it can be integrated for public reporting. So all of that is in process. It will likely move at a pace that none of us will enjoy. It will take a while both to select the software and then stand it up and integrate it with all that. But we have the commitment to continue doing that. The IAM budget this year includes the cost of the software and it includes professional technical services to help that integration and commitment of staff time to it. So it remains a priority of the administration to lean into this heavily in fiscal 26th.</td>

I just must, you know, I&#39;m only bringing I sound like a crank tonight, but when I&#39;m listening to this conversation and I want to just do a reset on this whole thing where it&#39;s like this was post-COVID or during COVID when there was a lot of issues with the filtration in the school systems. And this committee was formed out of a lot of that frustration and breakdown between school side, city side. And the part that gets me frustrated, this isn&#39;t a knock on anybody or digging about it. It&#39;s just one counselor&#39;s perspective is that we like hire these positions. Like I thought we hired somebody on the school side that was going to talk. And then we hired somebody on the city side or there&#39;s somebody in DPW that owns buildings to some degree. Like I just, where are we with, and then Rich is now talking about it as engineering, but it&#39;s like who on the day to day is like, managing these buildings. And again, I&#39;m not picking on anybody. I just don&#39;t, I feel like we&#39;re all kind of still feeling like who really has their hands on this. The system sounds great when it comes online at some point. But in the meantime, you know, if we go back to sleep, we could end up in another situation like we found ourselves in. We had a bunch of mechanical problems and, you know, once we got Honeywell in, things were good. But before that, we were getting ripped off or something. What&#39;s, is there any update in that area? Councilor Latham, can I see your hand up?</td>

We have a preventative maintenance manager. We put those positions in the budget years ago, as you guys know, to do this exact kind of work as far as identifying our systems and our buildings and kind of striking making categories about that. So we have a DPW system that really just categorizes our preventive maintenance and our systems and our boilers and HVAC and things like that. That&#39;s an internal DPW system. We are working with IM and Rich&#39;s team to take that information to make it to a broader system that&#39;s going to be more, you know, available like Rich was talking about. So we are managing our buildings. We are on top of what our system, both my PM manager and my building systems manager are phenomenal. They are in our buildings daily, looking at our systems, HVACs and boilers, which is why we have been doing some replacements and repairs to some systems and boilers that, you know, because of these positions that we put in place years ago. So just to answer your question, we are managing the buildings, and we do know what systems we have in place and what they&#39;re doing and what needs to happen in the future and X, Y, and Z. We are supporting Rich&#39;s team. What he needs to do is broader for the city and all of our buildings and facilities and that kind of thing. But BPW does have an internal system that we have categorized our HVAC systems and our bullish systems. And we have, we&#39;re very on top of when is needed, when, and we&#39;re trying to advocate to get those replaced and make sure funding&#39;s secure for those reasons.</td>

First, I would like to thank Committee Member Pitone for bringing this up again and for her advocacy years ago with my, along with my predecessor and for having us have this conversation today. I&#39;m just trying to understand because back in the fall we had this conversation and this committee was the first meeting we had in September of 2024 and shortly after that an infrastructure and asset management work to benefit some of the public schools summer 2024 presentation was shared with both the school committee and The city council, I was from August 3rd, 2024. And this was just shared by email. I think after that request was made and remember very specifically making the request. And I followed up with you, Mr. Raich, and you have mentioned two positions. So I&#39;m trying to understand how does this relate to the two positions? So one is hiring a construction liaison position to focus on planning and design phases of infrastructure improvement projects. And the other one is a construction liaison position So where are these positions filled and will these staff members be assigned the task of working on a reporting dashboard? Yeah, let&#39;s start there.</td>

And so she&#39;s actively involved in that big school replacement project. We just had a coffee hour with Winter Hill parents last week. We&#39;re going to have one with Brown parents later this week or next week. She works on things like that. This sort of... you know, day-to-day preventative maintenance is not the sort of thing that that position is envisioned to work on. As I say, from IAM&#39;s involvement, we&#39;re standing up a software system and interdepartmental system for reporting. And we do have a dedicated senior project manager to that project. But, you know, I&#39;m Apologies if there&#39;s any confusion. That&#39;s not sort of the function of that liaison position to actually communicate out what, you know, at this moment, you know, DPW is managing.</td>

That was, I think, the first one in September, is to have a project website. So it&#39;s for updates on school building facilities. As committee member Pitone was saying, it&#39;s to just get progress on the things we&#39;re doing in school buildings and have that transparency, which is something that parents have been asking for over and over. So what you&#39;ve mentioned earlier about software, Is that to do the work on having this project website? I just want to understand because there&#39;s a lot of different conversations about a project website, now this software. And again, the goal is just transparency and that we are showing progress on all this work. So again, I&#39;m making this ask and what&#39;s the update, if any.</td>

And that is, we&#39;re keeping that up to date. I think we just pushed some updates to it this week. In terms of the sort of broader building maintenance and improvements, we have yet to stand that up. And again, I think that getting the software in place is sort of a precursor to that. So it&#39;s still on the horizon, but we&#39;ve got a few steps. before we can get there. Certainly any other individual capital projects that happen in the meantime will have their own website. So we&#39;ve got project pages, for example, for the work that&#39;s happening on City Hall right now with regular posting and updates on the work that we&#39;re doing on City Hall. The next school project in our pipeline will be the replacement of the chiller at the west and the roof at the west. Design on that is advancing right now. Once that becomes a construction project, we&#39;ll have a project page for that with updates. And the next one after that in the queue is the boiler for the Healy. That&#39;s maybe about six months to a year behind the West. And again, we&#39;ll have a project page for that when that moves into construction.</td>

I know we can&#39;t necessarily commit to when this is going to be complete, but one would be a good estimation of when we could check in and see the status of this based on so that, you know, we might close this item out, but that everybody has it on their radar that we should check in in the spring, check in next fall. When is a good time to hear, you know, what&#39;s going on? What would the timeline look like? And then I think the thing that is most concerning from my perspective is sort of the scope of public information. What are you imagining and envisioning what that might look like?</td>

And the scope of the public interaction is actually going to be one of our selection criterion for the software. You know, as I say, we&#39;ve got 22 right now. We&#39;ve got to narrow it down to three or four to interview. And a big portion of that, perhaps as much as half, will be the interaction with the 311 and QAlert. And Steve Craig is on our selection committee. And, you know, I really want to get Steve&#39;s and, you know, frankly, Denise Taylor&#39;s input on that on that side of the house.</td>

So when you said, I really appreciate hearing like, all right, the chiller at the west and the roof on the west are the next things happening. And then the Healy boiler. And I know you have a list. It&#39;s not just those three things. I know you have a list of like 15 things. And then we also know that in so many years, those things are going to come up again. And it&#39;s almost like, I&#39;d love to at least capture that level of detail so that we don&#39;t have to bring you back in all the time to ask these questions or like, oh my gosh, I just saw a temporary chiller over at the X. Having an idea of what the master overview plan for the big items would be helpful. Maybe it&#39;s already there and I just don&#39;t know where it is. So I apologize if I&#39;m asking for something that exists, but that&#39;s the kind of detail I think that creates confidence in the community that we understand how the city is now really putting the energy and the money and the time to invest in these buildings in a way we have not.

Like you said, there&#39;s a life cycle on some of these systems too. So, I mean, that doesn&#39;t seem like it should be that heavy of a lift, Director Raish, just to get this stuff up on a website.

DPW is a process, just so you guys know, of revamping our websites. That&#39;s going to be very interactive and public-facing and have very interactive, popping kind of website, people&#39;s little website and DENISE GLUHAN- was going to be like a commissioners corner and we have talked about X, Y and Z, but we&#39;re going to have videos we&#39;re going to have updates and kind of showing next. DENISE GLUHAN- So there you know we are going to intend to have a section on our new website that&#39;s going to have. DENISE GLUHAN- public facing they can click on this button, this is where we are with this, and so we can definitely incorporate some of what you&#39;re asking into that and this DP W scale so that&#39;s something that once we get through budget season. Chair Merrilees, You know, we can work on with my building systems manager and I&#39;ve been a maintenance manager, just to give some updates of our dpw maintenance projects that are going to be school related and I think will be helpful and kind of lead to that transparency, we asked him for.</td>

I think even my colleagues had no idea. The city council, you just, if I&#39;m correct, allocated like half a million dollars for this boiler. at the brand, which is a significant chunk of change. And I feel like our constituents really need to understand the extent of all that money. So anything we can do until the system is built to just get the word out about how much money we are actually putting into our schools for preventative maintenance, whether that&#39;s through regular reports, however it is, I just really encourage us all to do that.</td>

Since there&#39;s a lot of work that happens over the summer, and as Commissioner Lathan mentioned, just the presentation we received from DPW, September 3rd, 2024, I was thrilled to see it. Just like, work is happening. Here&#39;s someone trying to keep track of all of this and share it with the school committee and the city council. So just something like that, and these are just slides, was very helpful for me as a counselor. And that&#39;s what I use to share with my constituents, the parents who are asking, what are we doing about this? What are we doing about that? So I think this will save time to all of us and again, will help that piece of transparency and just again, be public about the progress we&#39;re making because we know we are invest in money we are doing the work it&#39;s just again we&#39;re constantly having you here like this committee this time we&#39;re here is the only time we get to discuss these things and it&#39;s the only time for the public to get to learn about this progress we&#39;re making. So again, I encourage the administration to do that. And ideally start the school year with celebrating these things, right? September. Here&#39;s a report of what we&#39;ve done over the summer. And here&#39;s, um, here&#39;s the list of things that we&#39;ll be doing that we&#39;re anticipating to do, um, like the school year, something as simple as that, instead of waiting. Because again, it&#39;s been over a year since we made the initial, since I made the request and few years since my colleagues on the school committee have started this conversation.

We often, I don&#39;t know if we&#39;ve gotten it this year, but we often will get one in June about what&#39;s planned. And I can make the request that city councillors are copied on that. There&#39;s no reason that I don&#39;t think you can, because it usually comes in a memo format that you couldn&#39;t receive that memo if that&#39;s going to be helpful for you in communicating with constituents and then of course eventually move to the point where that information is more easily accessible to the public. Obviously if it&#39;s in our minutes that people can get at it but it&#39;s not on a website.</td>

Um, all right. Uh, so thank you for that. Um, we can mark this one work complete unless there&#39;s any objection to that. Um, and I see, so see, and now that&#39;ll be marked as work complete. The next item is item number five. So the next, the next two items are similar, but different enough that I thought it was appropriate to take them up separately. Um, certainly there&#39;s a bit of overlap or perhaps there&#39;s a bit of overlap, but, um, We can hit the specifics of these last two items each on their own. Item five is 25-0587, that the administration worked with the Director of Infrastructure and Asset Management and Commissioner of Public Works to accelerate maintenance schedules, invest in preventative repairs, and develop a clear contingency plan for school displacement. So this was submitted by Councillor Bayh. It&#39;s similar to an item that we had discussed previously, but Chair Bertone, you had suggested that it might be appropriate to come back to this discussion using this item as the means to do so. Any context or additional color you wanna bring to the discussion before we launch into it?</td>

But I think perhaps this can serve as an appetizer to that larger discussion at a later date.

But I did want to share that our city solicitor is working or has been working with their following up with the Somerville Public Schools legal team to follow up on that MOU for the coming school that was requested by the school committee in the subchapter. So I just wanted to provide that update. It&#39;s still in the works, so I don&#39;t have any more detail than that, except that they are working on it, and it&#39;s based off of some of the information that was in the resolution that was passed by the school team.

We made this motion that this MOU would be created and signed before the warming center was open. And so it&#39;s kind of shocking to me that we are just drafting it now. Putting a pin in that the district has emergency plans that we don&#39;t make public for what happens in a range of emergencies. I think what we&#39;re asking the city to provide is what is the emergency plan for if we have to close a building during a given school year? And I would expect that the city would want to update that regularly as things change. So can we get an update on when we can get a sense from the city on, because this is the issue, right? We&#39;ve had it happen in the past. Multiple times that a school has gone down in the middle of the school year and we need to move all those kids somewhere. And where we move them changes every time we have to do it. It&#39;s really important to us that we know from the beginning of the school year what the plan for that year is. So we&#39;ve got the summer now. And I guess I&#39;m wondering, can the city commit to get a plan in place if we have to close the school building in the 25-26 school year before we open it?</td>

We are working, again, like we&#39;ve mentioned throughout this meeting, on investments that are being made for preventative maintenance and repair so that we don&#39;t get to a place where we would need to relocate a school. When that has happened in the past, this administration has pulled together every department and resource to make sure that we are able to relocate an entire school. And at the same time, make sure that we do everything we can to mitigate the impact of that relocation on teachers, students, and staff. Unfortunately, there is no straightforward, simple solution to having a swing space, but we are working in collaboration with city departments and SPS administration to come up with a plan.</td>

So I look forward to hearing it. It is unfortunate that it&#39;s happening after the fact, but yeah, I still would like to see that information. The second piece is around coming up with contingency plans and I guess the answer I haven&#39;t, I appreciate Ms. Radassi&#39;s feedback that they are working on a plan. Is there a time when we might get the plan or an idea of a plan, which I know is not our favorite term, but I know that there could be multiple contingencies, but having some of that work already done in advance and research hopefully will help the whole city and the school in the unfortunate event if this does happen to turn something around a lot quicker then we have been able to.</td>

                <td>Yes, thank you, Chair Davis. This item came out of a discussion we had in school committee when our career and technical education program lead came before us and discussed a number of equipment-related maintenance items that he was concerned about in a larger package of funding needs for the CTE program. But in particular, items like air compressors, ovens, and other large pieces of equipment that happen to be housed in the CTE program in the Somerville High School are apparently part of the school budget for maintenance. Whereas if any of these equipment might have been in a different building, they would sit firmly in, you know, the maintenance for that would be the responsibility of DPW or I assume DPW. I&#39;m not going to assume I&#39;m not going to say I&#39;m an expert in how the city&#39;s budget is put together. But needless to say, you know, this raised a lot of questions in school committee about why schools are paying for this because it happens to be equipment in a school or as part of a particular program. So I think the request here is that public works and just pointing largely at quote unquote, the administration work to budget these items out of the city budget rather than out of the school&#39;s budget because I think the sense among school committee members was that these items do not belong in our budget. We&#39;re not facilities experts and the expertise and also efficiencies that come out of the city side of oversight of Again, these maintenance of these large items seems more appropriate on the city side. So that was the genesis of this, and I&#39;m happy to hear from Liaison or DASI or others in response to that.</td>

I think there&#39;s efficiencies of scale that we can only get by linking our equipment maintenance to the city&#39;s equipment maintenance. And so the more we can develop contracts where You know, part of maintaining the vents in CTE is whoever is maintaining the vents elsewhere in the city. So I just want to encourage us. It&#39;s not just who owns the equipment and therefore is responsible for paying for it. But what efficiencies of scale can we get by including this equipment in whatever maintenance contracts we have elsewhere for similar equipment?</td>

Are we expecting a decision before July 1st?</td>

And so my understanding is the conversation is focusing on how we can sustainably fund the funding. sustainably fund, sorry, I&#39;m mixing up these words, sustainably fund future equipment maintenance needs.</td>

                <td> Thank you through you chair. I&#39;m glad this is an item. I just want to give a little context. I think Councilor Clingan is right. It&#39;s a really good question of what we&#39;ve done. What have we done for the last four years when we&#39;ve been offering CTE education? I do believe that we have newer equipment. We have more complex equipment. Our enrollment has increased dramatically. And I think that has all led to greater cost for maintenance. And I think also with the new building, there&#39;s a greater expectation. in the quality of how our built equipment is maintained. So yes, I think we have been doing it some way in the past. I don&#39;t know if some of the maintenance was done by the teacher, who knows, because some of that equipment wasn&#39;t necessarily all computerized. It might&#39;ve been a mechanical lathe and that person knew how it operated and did the work to maintain it. So I just think that we&#39;re in a different space. The quality and the technology and the equipment is much more advanced and unfortunately, everybody was kind of surprised by, hey, you know, there&#39;s like over $100,000 of maintenance that needs to be done for next year. And my understanding, at least, and I apologize if you&#39;ve covered this, we&#39;ve taken some funds, some contingency, not contingency, but efficiency dollars from our current budget to prepay some of this out of the current school committee budget. But we don&#39;t want to be in the position where The school district is absorbing these costs every year, and they&#39;re not in the budget explicitly. And whether or not that dollar amount exists on the school budget side or exists on the city, it needs to be a new bucket, as opposed to the cost being absorbed by the old buckets that weren&#39;t planned to allocate that. So again, thrilled that the city and the district are working together on this, and I&#39;m looking forward to hearing wherever it goes. As long as we&#39;re funding it, I&#39;m pleased. So thank you.</td>

So, yeah, no, I mean, the idea that, you know, systems being broken maybe for multi years and kids missing out. Um, although I will say, I hope that kids will be extra responsible with this stuff too, because, you know, it&#39;s like, that&#39;s kind of, um, sometimes goofing around can, can end up costing us a lot of money. Um, so there&#39;s, there&#39;s a lot of, uh, there&#39;s gotta be some accountability too, um, with some of these things, but certainly if a system goes down, we shouldn&#39;t, have to wait until the school department&#39;s able to scrape up the funds to get something fixed we should be able to to help with that so hopefully we&#39;ll see where where we end up with this</td>

                <td> Okay, thank you, Councillor Clingan. I appreciate this discussion and thank you, Ms. Paton for your comments. I completely agree. It wouldn&#39;t surprise me at all if to some extent, not only the educators, but also some of the kids may have been helping with some of the maintenance as part of these incredibly valuable programs that we have. But I just, I want to kind of add to the conversation a much, you know, sort of a higher level, excuse me, yeah, higher level kind of filter for, you know, through you, Leah Zamardazzi, and Ms. Anasike, and Director Raish, and anyone else who is listening. you know, this committee and these joint meetings of these two committees were created pretty much exactly for these types of things, because in the past, you know, we&#39;ve seen that, you know, folks that came before us for the most part, weren&#39;t keeping up on maintenance of buildings and facilities. And that was a very, very specific driver of the creation of this body, of these subcommittees, so that we didn&#39;t fall into that situation going forward and that we make sure that we keep a focus and a spotlight on areas where ongoing preventative maintenance and any other kind of maintenance needs to happen so that we don&#39;t end up in a much worse situation for having failed to do that. And so I think many of those conversations were in relation to the buildings themselves and the conditions of the buildings and the You know, the primary systems, life safety systems that service those buildings. But to me, this is no different, right? As it was noted, we&#39;ve invested an incredible amount of money as a community in this high school facility. It&#39;s wonderful. You know, I think it&#39;s entirely likely that the increased enrollment and participation in these programs that was mentioned is because these facilities are so good. So, you know, let&#39;s make sure we take care of them and protect those investments with smaller dollars now so that they don&#39;t become bigger costs and headaches later. I just want to add my voice to that, to this, and I appreciate that that sounds like that conversation is already happening. I certainly look forward to hearing how we will approach that. Chair Baton, your hand up as well as Chief of Staff Anosike, I&#39;ll pass it back to you, Chair Baton, and to lead the conversation.</td>

Without their phenomenal leadership and attention to these matters, we wouldn&#39;t have this individual item before us. Because of their efforts, CTE has grown tremendously in recent years. And I think it&#39;s a testament not only to the facilities that we have been able to build and are continuing to maintain through partnership with the city, but also the school leadership. So just would be remiss with not also calling out their contributions. Ms. Anosike, did you want to add something?</td>
