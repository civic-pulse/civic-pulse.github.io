<h3 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h3>
<p>The Land Use Committee convened to discuss potential zoning ordinance amendments, specifically focusing on transit-oriented height and density bonuses for affordable housing and community benefits in the Gilman Square area. The committee reviewed a proposal from the Gilman Square Neighborhood Council, discussed the alignment of upzoning with city planning goals, and identified key considerations such as tax implications, shadow studies, and the impact of mass timber construction. The committee requested further information from the Assessor's Office regarding tax impacts and from the Inspectional Services Department (ISD) regarding readiness for mass timber construction.</p>

<h3 id="4-discussion-transit-oriented-height-and-density-bonuses-for-additional-affordable-housing-and-other-enumerated-community-benefits-agenda-item-725-0085">4. Discussion: Transit-Oriented Height and Density Bonuses for Additional Affordable Housing and Other Enumerated Community Benefits (Agenda Item 725-0085)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Originators:</strong> Councilor McLaughlin, Councilor Davis, Councilor Wilson</li>
<li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To direct the Director of Planning, Preservation, and Zoning to draft an amendment to the zoning ordinances for transit-oriented height and density bonuses for additional affordable housing and other enumerated community benefits.</li>
<li><strong>Presentation by Samantha Carr, Land Use Analyst:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Focus:</strong> Upzoning in Gilman Square as a starting point for transit-oriented development.</li>
<li><strong>Current Zoning:</strong> Primarily Mid-Rise 4 (MR4) along Medford and Pearl Street, with adjacent Broadway Street largely Mid-Rise 5 (MR5) and Mid-Rise 6 (MR6).</li>
<li><strong>Gilman Square Neighborhood Council Proposal:</strong><ul>
<li>Designation of an additional fabrication district parcel (currently MR4).</li>
<li>Incremental upzoning from MR4 to MR6 along Medford and Pearl Street.</li>
<li>Conversion of the Holman site (currently civic space) to MR6.</li>
<li>Expansion of pedestrian street designation along Medford and Pearl Street.</li>
<li>Proposed setbacks for mid-rise lots abutting neighborhood residential (NR) building types: 10-foot front and side setbacks, 10-20 foot rear setback.</li>
<li>Consideration of High-Rise designation for select parcels adjacent to the transit station.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Alignment with Somerville Vision:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Transform, Enhance, and Conserve Zoning Map:</strong> Enhancing parcels along Medford and Pearl Street directly adjacent to the Gilman Square T stop.</li>
<li><strong>Values Alignment:</strong> Community (neighborhood-by-neighborhood approach), Promoting Growth (resilient economic base, unlocking higher density), Sustainable (varied and affordable housing options).</li>
<li><strong>Implementation Priorities:</strong> Reduce vehicle miles traveled, maximize Green Line infrastructure investment, enable multimodal transportation.</li>
<li><strong>Topic Areas:</strong> Environment (leveraging Green Line extension), Commercial Development (zoning on commercial corridors), Housing (increasing supply to contain costs).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Alignment with Gilman Square Station Area Plan (2014):</strong><ul>
<li>Fill in gaps and encourage redevelopment of underutilized sites.</li>
<li>Promote attainable housing with a percentage of affordable units (20% affordable housing requirement would remain).</li>
<li>Reform zoning regulations to advance goals of enhancing and preserving the square.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Recommendations for Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li>Explore upzoning select parcels adjacent to the train station to a High-Rise designation, potentially drawing on the massing study for the Holman site.</li>
<li>Expand incremental upzoning to other parcels within the quarter-mile transit walk shed, potentially expanding Urban Residential (UR) designation for NR parcels adjacent to mid-rise properties or phasing from MR6 to MR4 along Pearl, Walnut, and Medford Streets.</li>
<li>Judicious approach to expanding pedestrian street designation due to ground-floor commercial requirements and potential for vacant storefronts.</li>
<li>Consider the trade-off between upzoning and potential tax increases on naturally occurring affordable housing units.</li>
<li>Explore mechanisms to incentivize public assets (e.g., public furniture, lighting, pedestrian infrastructure) alongside development.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Committee Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li>Councilor McLaughlin clarified that the discussion was theoretical and any formal proposal would involve public hearings.</li>
<li>The focus on Gilman Square was due to existing appetite for upzoning and ongoing city work on the Broadway corridor.</li>
<li>Councilor Wilson expressed enthusiasm for the proposal, particularly the UR designation next to MR for setback issues, and favored MR6 for density around T stations.</li>
<li>Councilor Wilson requested the Assessor's Office to provide information on the tax implications of upzoning.</li>
<li>Councilor Ewen-Campen noted that the Holman site redevelopment is not solely a zoning issue, as it is city-owned property, and suggested it remain zoned civic.</li>
<li>Councilor Ewen-Campen highlighted that previous upzoning in the area had not led to groundbreaking, suggesting market factors are at play.</li>
<li>Councilor Ewen-Campen expressed concern about potential tax increases for existing NR parcels if upzoned and seconded the request for the Assessor's Office.</li>
<li>Councilor Ewen-Campen suggested considering School Street for UR zoning changes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Requests for Next Steps:</strong><ul>
<li>Keep the Holman site zoned civic space.</li>
<li>Request data and a potential appearance from the Assessor's Office to understand tax implications of upzoning.</li>
<li>Consider School Street for zoning changes.</li>
<li>Begin drafting a formal proposal for upzoning in Gilman Square.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Comments from Dan Bartman, Director of Planning, Preservation, and Zoning:</strong><ul>
<li>Encouraged by the discussion of upzoning neighborhood parcels not directly on main streets, particularly using the UR zoning district to avoid non-conforming issues for existing buildings.</li>
<li>Acknowledged the current economic situation and the need for proposals to be realistic about what can be asked from development to ensure buildings are actually built.</li>
<li>Mentioned upcoming housing needs assessment studies that will provide economic information.</li>
<li>Announced a hybrid community event on September 23rd with Councilor Sait to review the Broadway corridor upzoning study.</li>
<li><strong>Potential Downsides of Upzoning (in response to Councilor Sait):</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Shadowing:</strong> Upzoning, especially along Medford Street, could cause shadows on north-side parcels. Modeling would be needed.</li>
<li><strong>Wind:</strong> High-rise development, particularly on the Holman site, could create unpleasant pedestrian wind conditions, requiring wind tunnel analysis.</li>
<li><strong>Reflectivity:</strong> Exterior materials of buildings near train stations must not cause glare for train operators, as seen with the D2.3 building in Union Square.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Discussion on Pedestrian Street Designation:</strong> No immediate thoughts from committee members; to be reflected upon.</li>
<li><strong>Discussion on Mass Timber Construction (from previous item):</strong><ul>
<li>Councilor Wilson emphasized the need to ensure the city is ready for mass timber (Type 4) construction, which was recently approved and can unlock financial viability for 8-15 story buildings that were previously uneconomical (the "donut hole" between 6-story wood-frame and 20+ story steel/concrete).</li>
<li>Director Bartman confirmed that Type 4 construction could lead to more precision in high-rise zoning districts, allowing for coding for 8, 12, or 15 stories, potentially combined with affordable housing incentives.</li>
<li>Director Bartman offered to share information from an architectural presentation on mass timber.</li>
<li>Councilor Wilson requested a staff memo from ISD confirming readiness for Type 4 construction.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Action:</strong> The liaison will follow up with the Assessor's Office and ISD regarding the requested information.</li>
<li><strong>Outcome:</strong> Discussion concluded; items to remain in committee for further work.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-adjournment">5. Adjournment</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Action:</strong> Councilor Wilson moved to adjourn the meeting.</li>
<li><strong>Vote:</strong><ul>
<li>Councilor Clingan: Yes</li>
<li>Councilor Sait: Yes</li>
<li>Councilor Wilson: Yes</li>
<li>Councilor McLaughlin: Yes</li>
<li>Councilor Ewen-Campen: Absent</li>
