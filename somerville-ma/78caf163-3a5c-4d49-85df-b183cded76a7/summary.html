Efforts to raise awareness for eviction sealing assistance, enabled by recent state legislation, were also detailed. Additionally, the committee received a report on the economic impact of federal immigration policy changes on small businesses and discussed strategies to mitigate construction impacts on local businesses.

<li><strong>Outcome:</strong> Approved.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-order-250133-update-on-condominium-conversion-and-tenant-protection-laws">2. Order 250133: Update on Condominium Conversion and Tenant Protection Laws</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Presenter:</strong> Ellen Schechter, Director of Office of Housing Stability</li>
<li><strong>Key Discussion Points:</strong><ul>
<li>The 2024 Housing Bond Bill introduced policy changes regarding condominium conversions and evictions, primarily affecting buildings with four or more units.</li>
<li>Somerville's existing ordinance, dating back to 1985, already regulates all two, three, and four-family buildings, regardless of owner-occupancy, exceeding the new state law's scope.</li>
<li>The state law now allows regulation of non-owner-occupied two and three-family buildings, a power Somerville already possessed.</li>
<li>The new state law is estimated to regulate an additional 287,200 units statewide, significantly increasing protections.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Ewen-Campen</strong> expressed appreciation for the update and looked forward to further discussions on strengthening the ordinance in legislative affairs.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Strezo</strong> inquired about the possibility of a Somerville resident preference for purchasing units during condo conversions.<ul>
<li><strong>Director Schechter</strong> clarified that tenants already have a right of first purchase in condo conversions.</li>
<li>She noted that a residency preference could be explored for properties where the city provides an exchange (e.g., variance, inclusionary zoning) or for specific programs like inclusionary housing and 100 Homes, where data showed no disadvantage to marginalized communities.</li>
<li>However, a general residency preference for market sales is legally complex due to anti-discrimination and fair housing laws.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Key Discussion Points:</strong><ul>
<li>The Affordable Homes Act included provisions for eviction record sealing, a goal Somerville has pursued for six years.</li>

<li><strong>Non-payment evictions:</strong> Can be immediately sealed upon full payment of judgment and obtaining a "satisfaction of judgment."</li>
<li><strong>Non-payment evictions (unpaid):</strong> Can be sealed after four years with no subsequent eviction action, provided the tenant demonstrates financial hardship.</li>
<li><strong>Fault evictions (e.g., unauthorized occupants, poor housekeeping):</strong> Can be sealed after seven years with no intervening eviction, demonstrating changed behavior.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Outreach Efforts (since May 5th):</strong><ul>
<li>Six regional workshops conducted in partnership with Cambridge, Cambridge and Somerville Legal Services, De Novo Legal Services, and Multi-Service Center.</li>

<li>Multiple presentations to provider and tenant groups.</li>
<li>All Office of Housing Stability staff are trained to assist with eviction sealing.</li>
<li>The Trial Court has developed a user-friendly online walkthrough system for pro se sealing petitions.</li>

Mayor's Request 251005: Approval of the 2025-2026 One-Year Action Plan for Community Development Block Grant (CDBG), Home Investment Partnerships (HOME), and Emergency Solutions Grant (ESG) Programs</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Presenters:</strong> Alan Ignacio, Director of Finance and Community Development, OSPCD; Miranda Rubin, Program Compliance Officer, OSPCD</li>
<li><strong>Key Discussion Points:</strong><ul>
<li>This is an annual item for HUD entitlement programs.</li>
<li>All three programs were relatively level-funded for 2025-2026:<ul>
<li><strong>CDBG:</strong> <strong>$2,477,825</strong> (funds a wide variety of activities).</li>
<li><strong>HOME Investment Partnership:</strong> <strong>$517,544</strong> (focuses on housing activities and new housing development).</li>
<li><strong>ESG (Emergency Solutions Grant):</strong> <strong>$218,817</strong> (focuses on homelessness prevention and support services).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The plan and public hearing presentation were attached to the item.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Strezo</strong> asked about significant changes from the previous year's plan.<ul>
<li><strong>Director Ignacio</strong> highlighted the city's first-time leveraging of the full CDBG program's financing capabilities through a Section 108 borrowing.</li>
<li>This will provide approximately <strong>$10 million</strong> in financing for Phase Two of the Clarendon Hill project.</li>
<li>This will reduce pressure on the city's general fund but will cost the city approximately <strong>$500,000</strong> in annual entitlement payments.</li>
<li>The Clarendon Hill project is considered a much-needed development for the city.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Ewen-Campen</strong> had no further questions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Outcome:</strong> Item moved forward to the full City Council for approval.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="6-order-251200-update-on-efforts-to-mitigate-construction-impacts-on-small-businesses">6. Order 251200: Update on Efforts to Mitigate Construction Impacts on Small Businesses</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Presenter:</strong> Dana Whiteside, Deputy Director of Economic Development</li>
<li><strong>Key Discussion Points:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Limited Funding:</strong> Economic Development has limited financial resources to directly compensate businesses for construction impacts.</li>
<li><strong>Role as Convener:</strong> The division aims to convene relevant city departments and third-party entities to improve communication and mitigation strategies.</li>
<li><strong>Two Categories of Projects:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>City-led projects:</strong> More control over communication and planning.</li>
<li><strong>Non-city-led projects (e.g., Eversource):</strong> Less direct control, but efforts are being made to align and prepare for communication.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Strezo</strong> shared concerns from businesses:<ul>
<li>Lack of advance notice for disruptive construction (e.g., jackhammering), leading to lost business days.</li>
<li>Impact of "snow days" on small businesses due to reduced foot traffic and parking issues.</li>
<li><strong>Concerns about contractors:</strong><ul>
<li>Questioned the city's power to choose contractors who respect the community and small businesses.</li>
<li>Cited examples of contractors driving dangerously and disrespecting residents (e.g., placing porta-potties near children's bedrooms).</li>
<li>Emphasized the need for contractors to consider businesses during projects and for effective communication (e.g., clear signage, flyers).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Ewen-Campen</strong> shared experiences from Spring Hill and Somerville Ave construction projects:<ul>
<li>Acknowledged improvements in city outreach but noted missed opportunities for basic communication.</li>
<li>Suggested large, friendly signs stating "businesses are open, please continue to support."</li>
<li>Recalled initial negative public reaction to a sign indicating three years of disruption for the Somerville Ave project, which caused fear among Union Square businesses.</li>
<li>Emphasized the need for proactive, upfront meetings and better signage (e.g., Somerville Museum's request for "businesses still open" signs during Central Street closure).</li>
<li>Stressed that while construction is inherently disruptive, better communication and visible support can build goodwill.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Deputy Director Whiteside</strong> agreed that there is an opportunity for the city to be more strategic and effective in its communications, regardless of who controls the construction project. He expressed willingness to continue the conversation and seek input from the committee.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Outcome:</strong> Item to remain in committee for further discussion and development of strategies.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="7-resolution-251178-administration-notifying-mobile-square-businesses-of-black-construction-projects">7. Resolution 251178: Administration Notifying Mobile Square Businesses of Black Construction Projects</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Key Discussion Points:</strong><ul>
<li>This resolution is related to the previous item on mitigating construction impacts.</li>
<li><strong>Deputy Director Whiteside</strong> suggested that this item also remain in committee and be integrated with the broader discussion on construction impact mitigation, as it represents a specific instance of the larger issue.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Outcome:</strong> Item to remain in committee.</li>
</ul>
