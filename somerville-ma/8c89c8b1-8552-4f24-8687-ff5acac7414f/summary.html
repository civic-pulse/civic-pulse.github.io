<h3 id="case-142-cross-street-zp-25-000019">Case: 142 Cross Street (ZP-25-000019)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Applicant:</strong> JAC Investments LLC</li>
<li><strong>Request:</strong> Hardship variance from the secondary front facade build-out requirement to construct an apartment building in the Midrise 3 (MR3) zoning district.</li>
<li><strong>Presentation by Applicant (Evan Stallman, Cost of Design and Appropriate; Christopher Alberto, Attorney):</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Location:</strong> 142 Cross Street, at the corner of Cross Street and Alston Street, bound by the Green Line to the north.</li>
<li><strong>Existing Structure:</strong> One-story structure, in poor condition, approved for demolition by the Historic Commission.</li>
<li><strong>Proposed Structure:</strong> Three-story, three-family apartment building.</li>
<li><strong>Variance Request:</strong> Seeking relief for the minimum facade build-out on Alston Street.<ul>
<li><strong>Zoning Requirement:</strong> 65% (approximately 15 feet) of the Alston Street lot line to be built out.</li>
<li><strong>Proposed:</strong> 58.6% (13 feet 6 inches).</li>
<li><strong>Reason for Variance:</strong> Due to specific setback requirements:<ul>
<li>10-foot setback from the adjacent Neighborhood Resident (NR) zone.</li>
<li>12-foot curb setback from both Cross Street and Alston Street.</li>
<li>Meeting the facade build-out would violate either the curb setback on Cross Street or reduce the NR setback to 8 feet 6 inches.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Streetscape Improvements:</strong> Proposed 12-foot curb setback on Alston Street with two new street trees, pervious pavers, long-term bike parking, and a ramp to the rear entrance.</li>
<li><strong>Architectural Design:</strong><ul>
<li>Cast stone at the base, cementitious siding with reglets on the first story, and cementitious siding with alternate colors on upper floors.</li>
<li>Aesthetic aims to be complementary to the neighborhood, surrounded by three and four-story structures.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Hardship Variance Criteria Justification:</strong><ol>
<li><strong>Special Circumstances:</strong> Irregular lot shape (pie-shaped) facing Alston Street. Literal enforcement would prevent development by right.</li>
<li><strong>Substantial Hardship:</strong> Existing structure is in disrepair. Not allowing the variance would be financially detrimental, preventing the development of needed housing in an MR3 zone.</li>
<li><strong>Public Good/Intent of Ordinance:</strong> Development complies with all other zoning regulations and is in keeping with the neighborhood's intent. The proposed building is a simple three-story, three-family structure.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Height:</strong> 32 feet from grade to the top of the roof, with an additional 10 feet for the head house.</li>
<li><strong>Abutting Property:</strong> The owner of the abutting property (to the right) is working with the applicant's firm on an addition to their structure and has no objections to the proposed project. They attended two neighborhood meetings.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Public Comment Period:</strong><ul>
<li>Opened by Susan Fontano.</li>
<li>No members of the public raised their hand to speak.</li>
<li>Closed by Susan Fontano.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Board Discussion and Questions:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Anne Brockleman:</strong> Clarified that the new building would be set back, widening the sidewalk on both sides.</li>
<li><strong>Brian Cook:</strong> Focused on the second hardship criterion.<ul>
<li><strong>Evan Stallman:</strong> Confirmed JAC Investments LLC is the current owner. Explained that the existing structure is vacant and in significant disrepair, requiring substantial repairs. Re-developing the lot would require a variance due to the facade build-out, and without it, the investment would be lost.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Susan Fontano:</strong><ul>
<li>Inquired about the MR3 zoning for this specific parcel, noting it appears to be a standalone MR3 zone. Steve Carey confirmed it is a lone MR3 parcel.</li>
<li>Expressed concern about the size of the building (32 feet plus 10 feet for the head house) and its impact on the adjacent residential property, particularly regarding windows and roof access.</li>
<li><strong>Evan Stallman:</strong> Confirmed the head house is for equipment and provides access to a small roof deck for third-floor residents.</li>
<li><strong>Evan Stallman:</strong> Confirmed one balcony on the second floor and a patio on the first floor (approximately 5x8 feet).</li>
<li><strong>Evan Stallman:</strong> Clarified that two neighborhood meetings were held, and the need for the variance arose after an updated survey showed the curb closer than initially thought.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Motion:</strong> To approve the hardship variance for 142 Cross Street (ZP-25-000019) with the conditions as set forth in the staff memo dated June 12, 2025, finding that all criteria required for issuing a hardship variance have been satisfied.<ul>
<li><strong>Moved by:</strong> Sisia Daglian</li>
<li><strong>Seconded by:</strong> Brian Cook</li>

<li><strong>Vote:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>For:</strong> 4 (Anne Brockleman, Sisia Daglian, Brian Cook, Susan Fontano)</li>
<li><strong>Against:</strong> 0</li>
<li><strong>Abstentions:</strong> 0</li>
