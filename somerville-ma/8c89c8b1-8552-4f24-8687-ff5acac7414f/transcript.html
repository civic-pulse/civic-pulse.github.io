                <td>All right. And if Cindy Larson shows up, the architect, if you could promote her as well. I don&#39;t really need her, but always good to have. So there we go. So you can see my screen that the property here is where the big B is actually on medford street is parcel three here on the city assessors map, and that is this the seat the storefront that they are going to be leasing I will now scroll down here and shrink this because it&#39;s getting a little big, this is. The storefront. attached to a to the two family house at 374 Medford Street. The storefront is 374 A. This was last a pizzeria, but it has been vacant for some time here in Gilman Square. It&#39;s in the neighborhood resident zone and the small business overlay as such, as you know, requires a special permit. There&#39;s not gonna be any other work to this building exterior other than signage and painting. going down to the next tier. And not that it matters all that super much. That&#39;s what the back of it looks like, such as it is. This is more an orientation to Gilman Square. You can see the 374A is right here on the right. And then you can see the center of Gilman Square is right down the road here. So it&#39;s actually pretty close, although it is in the neighborhood resident zone for whatever reason. and this one&#39;s not wanting to populate terribly quickly okay here we go this is uh and this is the map of google map that gives you a better idea this right here is 374a and you can see here&#39;s uh sarma restaurant and the uh the mad oyster studios and all just to give you a uh orientation for it So, there&#39;s going to be obviously as you can see there&#39;s no parking on site, and there is no parking required. The client will be doing interior renovation. I can show you here. A floor plan again not really a zoning matter but just out of curiosity, you might want to see what the interior looks like. Sorry about that. Trying to get it all on screen. There we go. The it is it&#39;s going to be it&#39;s about 600 square feet so it&#39;s pretty small and it&#39;s take out there isn&#39;t any seating in here. So the city&#39;s economic development division has said that. They determined that the proposed improvements will help activate the ground floor spaces and facades and dramatically increase visibility and attractiveness of the former vacant ground floor commercial space, improve the interplay of ground floor space and civic space by enhancing the appearance of the site&#39;s existing ground floor commercial space by repainting the facade, improve the building signage and wayfinding around the site by installing new dedicated commercial signage on the site&#39;s facade, improving the attractiveness of the existing commercial space at the property and improving site access to pedestrian and bicyclists by providing an attractive destination for such users in the form of an attractive ground floor commercial cafe space the economic development division has no objections or conditions to applicants proposal in its current form So the proposed use meets the goals of the Somerville Zoning Ordinance and the Somervision 2040 plan because it fills the long vacant storefront, it serves residents and businesses in the area, provides a unique food option, being the Brazilian cafe, provides additional tax revenue to the city, enhances the businesses near the Gilman Square T Station by giving people who work there somewhere to eat, and promotes a small family-owned business, as you can see the families here. Uh, we held a very positive neighborhood meeting and heard from people who are very excited about this, um, opening and activating that space. Uh, therefore the applicants asked that this board grant the requested special permit for bakery cafe or coffee shop use in the small business overlay. And we&#39;re here for questions and comments as you may see fit.</td>

                <td>So, for the record, my name is Evan Stallman with a business address of 17. I blue streets, 400 Somerville, Massachusetts. Today, we&#39;re looking at the parcel located at 142 cross street. I&#39;ll zoom in on the zoning map here to get a sense of the locus. So it is an MR3 parcel. It is 2 lots in from McGrath highway. So, it&#39;s at the corner cross street and Austin street, and it&#39;s bound by the green line on the north side of the site. So today we&#39;re going, we&#39;re seeking a variance for the minimum facade build out. And I will, I&#39;ll walk you through why we need that when we get into the site plan. But just to orient you with the site, Cross Street&#39;s on the left side of this plan. Alston Street is on the bottom. There&#39;s an existing one story structure that occupies a majority of the site currently. And that structure, it&#39;s not in great condition and it has been approved by the Historic Commission for demolition. This plan is our proposed site plan cross streets on the bottom here. Austin street is on the right side as you can see with this yellow outline. We&#39;re proposing a structure that complies with most of the zoning regulations. If we comply with all the zoning regulations, we want to be here tonight. But we are adjacent to an NR zone on the right side from Cross Street. And lots in an MR3 zone require a 10 foot setback from NR lots. So from the right side from Austin, we&#39;re required to maintain 10 feet here. and then there&#39;s a zoning stipulation that requires a 12-foot curb setback from both fronts. So the building needs to be set back 12 feet from the curb on Alston Street and then 12 feet from the curb on Cross Street. Because of those setback regulations, we&#39;re not able to meet the minimum facade build out on Alston Street. We have 13 foot six facade build out and we&#39;re required to have just under 15 feet facade build out. So zoning requires that 65% of the Alston Street lot line be built out with a structure, which would be that 15 feet, and we&#39;re only able to meet it at 58.6%. I do have another plan. on this sheet showing what a compliance structure would look like if we did meet the facade build out. So in order to do that, we would have to violate either the curb setback on Cross Street, or we would have to reduce the right side setback from Austin Street to about eight foot six inches. So we thought that going for the facade build out was the lesser of the two evils. That way we would maintain compliance with the intent of the zoning code. with regards to setbacks. We are proposing some pretty intensive streetscape updates as part of this project. So we have the 12-foot curb setback on Alston Street where we have two new street trees before the bridge begins. We have some pervious pavers as part of the furnishing zone of the sidewalk. And then on the right side, we have a ramp that comes up to grade, some long-term bike parking, and then an entrance into the rear of the building. These are the proposed elevations of the structure. This top elevation here is the elevation from Cross Street. You can see we have a cast stone material at the base of the building, followed by a cementitious siding with some reglets on the first story as it wraps around to Austin Street. And then the massing at the left side and the upper two floors are clad with cementitious siding. And we use some alternate colors to accentuate the massings there. This bottom elevation is the front elevation from Austin Street. It&#39;s really just this sliver here that is the front elevation. You can see the same materiality wrapping around from Cross Street onto this elevation. And then these two elevations are the right side from Austin Street is this top elevation. You can see that ramp coming up to the rear entrance here. And then this bottom elevation is the left side elevation, which faces the rail right of way to the north of our site. And these are just some proposed perspectives of the structure. As you can see, we&#39;re not deviating from the aesthetic of the neighborhood. We&#39;re surrounded by a series of three and four story structures. So we aim to be complementary to the neighborhood. With regards to the circumstances or the The conditions required to grant a variance for this. The first condition is special circumstances exist relating to the soil conditions, shape or unusual character of an existing structure, but not affecting generally the zoning district in which the lander structure is located. I&#39;d say that we We fall under this because the lot is in irregular shape and due to the pie shape that faces Alston Street, literal enforcement of the zoning code would not allow a structure to be developed by right on this lot. The second one is literal enforcement of the provisions of this ordinance for the district where the subject land or structure is located would involve substantial hardship, financial or otherwise, to the petitioner or appellant due to said circumstances. Kind of going off of what I said previously, the existing structure is not in great condition. We do want to provide some housing on this lot and MR3 zoning is seeking housing in that zone. So we feel that proposing the structure that complies with pretty much all of the other zoning requirements of MR3 zone would be beneficial and not allowing a variance for the facade build out would be detrimental financially for the appellant. then the third condition is desirable relief could be granted without causing substantial detriment to the public good and without nullifying or substantially derogating from the intent and purpose of a specific district in this ordinance or the ordinance in general. As I had mentioned, the development is compliant with all of their zoning regulations, and we are in keeping with the intent of the neighborhood we are not proposing anything uh really far-fetched here we&#39;re just uh trying to do a simple three-story three-family structure on this lot um i think that&#39;s everything that we have unless chris you wanted to add anything no i think you covered it very well okay thank you is there anyone here sorry</td>

But what&#39;s sort of within the scope of the board&#39;s review tonight isn&#39;t the story height or height of the building because that&#39;s compliant. That&#39;s You know that that that complies with the zoning ordinance what they are asking for relief from is from the secondary facade build out. And actually, the reason they&#39;re not able to make that secondary facade build out is because they&#39;re respecting the 10 foot requirement. From nr which is you know, intended to reduce the impact of Mr three sized buildings on neighborhood residents district, so they are they are you know. trying to abide by that. And just the scale and the height of the building they&#39;re proposing is compliant with the zoning ordinance.</td>
