<h3 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h3>
<p>The Finance Committee convened to address a 14-item agenda. Key discussions included the withdrawal of a $38,500 grant request for the Police Department's Special Response Team equipment, and the approval to dispose of 78 abandoned bicycles to the YMCA for community distribution. The committee also considered a 10-year contract for the Blue Bikes program, a lease renewal for the Grove Street parking lot, and a time extension for a training program with Franklin Cummings Institute. Significant debate occurred regarding the Urban Center Housing Tax Increment Financing (UCTIF) agreement for the 299 Broadway project, specifically concerning public park hours and the inclusion of "hostile architecture" provisions, leading to the withdrawal and planned resubmission of two related agenda items for further amendment.</p>

<li>The City Council conditionally agreed to a 100% exemption for 20 years in 2023. The project will create 319 housing units (136 affordable), retail space, and public civic spaces.</li>
<li>An independent real estate consultant, Abramson &amp; Associates, confirmed the full exemption is still needed for a reasonable return on investment. The agreement reflects updated project financials and an increase in unit count approved by the ZBA.</li>
<li>Councilor Burnley inquired about the $4.3 million figure in the agreement. Attorney Kathy Lester Salkert clarified that this refers to the base, unimproved value, and the UCTIF applies to the increment in value, which is deferred for 20 years.</li>
<li>Councilor Mbah sought clarification on the different financing mechanisms (TIF, DIF, UCTIF).

<h4 id="agenda-items-13-14-id-25-1163-id-25-1164-mayors-requests-for-easements-for-299-broadway-project">Agenda Items 13 &amp; 14: ID 25-1163 &amp; ID 25-1164 - Mayor's Requests for Easements for 299 Broadway Project</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Description:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>ID 25-1163:</strong> Mayor requests approval of a public access and maintenance access easement for 299 Broadway Property Owner, LLC.</li>
<li><strong>ID 25-1164:</strong> Mayor requests approval of a maintenance, access, easement, and landscape management and maintenance plan for 299 Broadway Property Owner LLC for the future Sewell Park at the 299 Broadway development facility. (Note: A replacement item for 1164 was on the agenda for Thursday night).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li>Attorney Kathy Lester Salkert explained these easements are being executed in advance to provide predictability for financers. The agreements cover the Broadway Pocket Park and Sewell Park, connected by a pedestrian "Muse." A single landscape maintenance and management plan covers all three areas.</li>
<li>Sewell Park will be purchased with MassWorks grant money, held by the SRA, and then conveyed to the city. This explains the substitute item for 1164.</li>
<li>Councilor Wilson summarized the agreements: 24/7 public access to the Muse and Temple Street Passageway, 8 AM to sunset access to Broadway Park and Plaza. The property owner is responsible for maintenance and repairs of civic spaces and pedestrian access areas, and any changes require city approval. Sewell Park will be transferred to the city in perpetuity, with the property owner responsible for its maintenance.</li>
<li>Councilor Scott raised concerns about "hostile architecture" in the park design, noting the detailed nature of the documents regarding plant species and pest management but the absence of specific prohibitions against such architecture.<ul>
<li>Brett McDonald, attorney for the developer, clarified that Condition 83 of the comprehensive permit requires PSOP approval for all landscape construction plans and details, including outdoor furniture, addressing Councilor Scott's concern.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Councilor Wilson questioned the "sunset" closing time for the Broadway Park and Plaza, noting that sunset can be as early as 4:15 PM in winter. He suggested aligning with the city's standard park hours (10 PM to 8 AM).<ul>
<li>Attorney Salkert initially stated it was based on a city ordinance for general park hours.</li>
<li>Councilor Burnley cited Somerville's Code of Ordinances, Article 3, Section 12-48, which states parks and playgrounds are closed between 10 PM and 8 AM.</li>
<li>Scott Lombardi from Mark Development stated the intent was to follow city ordinances and expressed willingness to change the language to reflect the 10 PM closing time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The committee agreed to request changes to the easement language to reflect the 10 PM closing time for the park.</li>
<li>Legislative Liaison Kimberly Hutter requested to withdraw both items 13 and 14 to allow for the necessary amendments and resubmission of new items for Thursday's agenda.</li>
<li>Councilor Mbah requested clean, updated documents for review by tomorrow, not Thursday.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Action:</strong> Items 13 and 14 marked as withdrawn. New items will be submitted for Thursday's agenda, with one replacement item (for 1164) already posted and a supplemental item (for 1163) to be posted tomorrow, incorporating the agreed-upon changes to park hours.</li>
</ul>
