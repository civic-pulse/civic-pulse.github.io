<h3 id="6a-report-of-the-committee-on-finance-meeting-as-a-committee-of-the-whole-on-june-3rd-2025">6A Report of the Committee on Finance, Meeting as a Committee of the Whole on June 3rd, 2025</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Mayor Ballantyne</strong> presented the FY26 budget, totaling <strong>$380.1 million</strong> (including a <strong>$112.3 million</strong> school budget).<ul>
<li>Highlighted a <strong>7.4% increase in school funding</strong>, totaling a <strong>34% increase</strong> since she took office.</li>
<li><strong>$1.5 million</strong> was set aside for the new Somerville Educators Union contract, contributing to the school budget increase and settling a three-year contract with salary increases for teachers, paraprofessionals, liaisons, and administrators.</li>
<li>Emphasized preserving core city services and advancing initiatives like an emergency vehicle preemption system, permanent supportive housing, 77 climate-forward strategies, 974 affordable housing units in the pipeline, a compost pilot for 1,000 households, cross-training DPW workers, and establishing the Armory as a publicly owned arts center.</li>
<li>Noted the city's AAA bond rating for the third consecutive year.</li>
<li>Expressed "significant concern" regarding a vote on Tuesday night to cut a salary line in her office, arguing it was an unjust action against an individual, undermining staff morale and the city's ability to attract talent. She stated the position was supported in the Charter reform proposal.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Wilson</strong> moved to sever <strong>Item 6E13 (25-1189)</strong>, an order by Councilor Scott to reduce the Executive Office Administration personal services salaries line by <strong>$186,744</strong> in the FY26 budget, for a separate vote.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Davis</strong> expressed disappointment with the Mayor's statement, arguing the cut was about the position's necessity, not the individual. He stated the Council's power to cut funds and that the Charter-created position is distinct from the current one.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Ewen-Campen</strong> acknowledged the Council's power to cut but criticized the lack of deliberation on the motion, noting the psychological impact on staff.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Clingan</strong> agreed with the ability to cut positions and the distinction of the Charter position but was "offended" by the Mayor's statement. He intended to switch his vote to support the position.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Wilson</strong> urged colleagues to set aside emotions and consider the impact on the Charter Home Rule petition at the State House.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Mbah</strong> expressed frustration with the lack of communication from the administration regarding the position's role but would switch his vote to support the position for the sake of the Charter's passage.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor McLaughlin</strong> stated he would vote against the cut, as his previous reasons for supporting it (lack of communication, union negotiation, Charter status) had been addressed. He criticized the lack of an "open door policy" from the administration.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Scott</strong> emphasized the Council's role as a deliberative body and criticized the Mayor's statement as "corrosive" and disrespectful to the legislative branch.</li>
<li><strong>President Pineda-Newfeld</strong> shared her experience as a city contractor during COVID-19, highlighting the anxiety city staff face during budget season. She argued the cut felt personal and that the Council should focus on broader constituent needs.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Clingan</strong> defended the Council's role in accountability and expressed offense at the implication that councilors don't understand city operations.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Davis</strong> reiterated that city staff are overworked and that the cut was about resource allocation, not a personal attack.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Vote on Item 6E13 (25-1189) - Reduce Executive Office Administration Personal Services Salaries by $186,744:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Outcome:</strong> Not approved.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Councilor Davis</strong> acknowledged extensive community communication. He emphasized the overlay district as key, providing comfort that the zoning change is part of a long community process with ongoing oversight from the Planning Board and Urban Design Commission. He reiterated that the community benefits agreement (CBA) vote did not influence his zoning decision.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Ewen-Campen</strong> stated he would vote yes, calling it a "tough vote." He detailed the process, starting with the developer's withdrawn proposal in 2023, leading to city-led planning. He highlighted:<ul>
<li>Minimization of traffic issues (low parking ratio, free shuttles, aggressive mobility management plan with stop points after each phase).</li>
<li>Amendment to require a residential component.</li>
<li>Community Benefits Agreement (CBA) negotiated by the Union Square Neighborhood Council (USNC), including a Project Labor Agreement (PLA), 1,000 sq ft of art space, a youth community center, financial contributions to nonprofits, and independent oversight of traffic issues.</li>
<li>Defended the USNC from "unfair shade," stating criticism should be directed at elected officials.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Wilson</strong> reiterated his support, acknowledging neighbor concerns but trusting the changes made to the zoning and the developer's incentive to minimize construction and traffic impacts.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Mbah</strong> thanked the Land Use Committee and supported the overlay zoning, calling it "the best of what community-driven planning can look like." He cited the unanimous committee support, the CBA, and PLA as creating opportunities for local jobs, youth pipelines, art space, and a climate tech cluster. He also supported an independent oversight committee.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Scott</strong> praised the Land Use Committee's work and the decade-long organizing effort. He called the CBA and PLA "absolute wins" and the best development review process yet, setting a new standard for community engagement.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor McLaughlin</strong> supported the item, crediting the ward councilors and neighborhood council for their work. He stated the community vote did not impact his decision, as he evaluates deals independently. He highlighted the new standard set for developers to meet community standards, unlike past projects in Assembly Square and Union Square.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Clingan</strong> supported the item, agreeing with previous comments and praising the Land Use Committee's thoroughness and the community's role in negotiations.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Sait</strong> supported the item, citing traffic mitigation plans (including a four-phase parking spot build-out with Planning Board oversight), the CBA, PLA, and the amendment requiring residential housing.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Burnley</strong> recalled his initial stance three years ago: "get the community on your side, and you'll have my support." He honored that promise, supporting the agreement forged by the community.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Strezo</strong> supported the project, emphasizing the community-driven process, the CBA, and the PLA. She confirmed with Director Galgani that the proposed shuttles would be available to all Somerville residents.</li>
