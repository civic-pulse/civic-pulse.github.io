<p><strong>Executive Summary:</strong>
The Somerville Zoning Board of Appeals convened remotely to address several zoning matters. Key actions included the continuation of three variance cases for 379 Somerville Avenue and two special permit cases for 14 McGrath Highway. The Board also approved the minutes from two previous meetings. A significant portion of the meeting was dedicated to a 40B change request for the Clarendon Hill project, which was deemed insubstantial and approved. Additionally, an extension for a special permit at 56 Webster Avenue was approved with modified conditions. A hardship variance for 103 Gilman Street was approved to address public safety concerns related to an existing non-conforming structure. Finally, a hardship variance for 181 Pearl Street was approved, allowing for a landscape buffer modification due to an encroaching driveway, with support from the affected neighbor.</p>

<h3 id="6-clarendon-hill-project-40b-change-request">6. Clarendon Hill Project - 40B Change Request</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Case Number:</strong> 40B-2020-001-R3</li>
<li><strong>Applicant:</strong> Preservation of Affordable Housing (POAH), represented by John Springfield (Senior Project Manager) and Tim Sinan (Icon Architecture).</li>
<li><strong>Project Summary:</strong> Redevelopment of existing obsolete state public housing at Clarendon Hill and West Somerville with newly constructed permanently affordable housing, adding new affordable and unrestricted apartments. Phase 1 is nearing completion.</li>
<li><strong>Proposed Modifications:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Phasing:</strong> The updated phasing proposes two POA-led phases to advance first, with the market-rate building (originally led by Red Gate Residential) becoming part of a third phase due to market conditions.</li>
<li><strong>Thoroughfare Design (Stevenson Aamon Way):</strong> Modifications based on city staff feedback.<ul>
<li>Shifted "Woonerf" (enhanced wide crosswalk) to prioritize pedestrian access to Central Park. The finished condition will be completed with Phase 2 to prevent damage.</li>
<li>Shifted pedestrian crossings and reduced crossing length at several points.</li>
<li>Adjusted location of street trees and some bicycle facilities due to other changes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Board Questions/Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Councilor Ann Brockleman:</strong> Inquired about the "slightly shifted" dimensions, clarified that shifts were within approximately 5 feet. Discussed street tree spacing (35-45 feet apart) and coordination with utilities.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Brian Cook:</strong> Asked staff (Steve Carey) about the definition of "substantial" vs. "insubstantial" changes for 40B permits. Steve Carey confirmed that changes in building height, massing, unit count, or housing tenure are primary categories for substantial changes, while landscape design and mobility access are generally considered insubstantial.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Public Comment:</strong> No members of the public raised their hand to speak.</li>
<li><strong>Motion:</strong> Ann Fullerton moved to find the changes for 40B-2020-001-R3 Clarendon Hill as insubstantial and to approve them based on the changes to the findings, conditions of approval, and one waiver from the original approval as outlined in the July 10, 2025, Zoning Board of Appeals staff memo.</li>
<li><strong>Second:</strong> Ann Brockleman.</li>
<li><strong>Vote:</strong><ul>
<li>Cecilia Daglian: Aye</li>
<li>Zach Zaremba: Aye</li>
<li>Ann Brockleman: Aye</li>
<li>Ann Fullerton: Aye</li>
<li>Ursula Susan Fontano: Aye</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Outcome:</strong> Motion passed unanimously (5-0). The changes were deemed insubstantial and approved.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="7-56-webster-avenue-special-permit-extension">7. 56 Webster Avenue - Special Permit Extension</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong> This case was previously opened and continued from May 14, 2025.</li>
<li><strong>Applicant:</strong> Jennifer (representing the applicant) and Catherine (representing the city).</li>
<li><strong>Proposed Action:</strong> Extend the special permit as requested, recognizing two years from the State Permit Extension Act, plus the exercise of the first extension, and providing for two additional one-year extensions upon conditions.</li>
<li><strong>Key Conditions:</strong> Reporting requirements at six-month intervals, with the first report due at the end of March 2026, tied to an updated timeline for moving the laundry.</li>
<li><strong>Board Questions/Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Councilor Brian Cook:</strong> Inquired if a six-month reporting period was sufficient given the long horizon. Jennifer confirmed comfort with the period, noting that the reports would track progress even if market conditions delayed significant changes.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Zach Zaremba:</strong> Emphasized the need for substantive reports, not just "nothing's changed," to detail activities undertaken.</li>
<li><strong>Enforcement:</strong> Steve Carey confirmed that Inspectional Services Department (ISD) would enforce reporting requirements, and failure to report would be a violation of the special permit.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Public Comment:</strong> No members of the public raised their hand to speak.</li>
<li><strong>Motion:</strong> Ann Fullerton moved to approve the extension of the special permit timeline and modifications to the conditions as noted in the Somerville Zoning Board of Appeals staff memo dated July 9, 2025, including a submitted timeline, and to make the findings related to the tolling dates as recommended in the staff memo.</li>
<li><strong>Second:</strong> Ann Brockleman.</li>
<li><strong>Vote:</strong><ul>
<li>Brian Cook: Aye</li>
<li>Zach Zaremba: Aye</li>
<li>Ann Brockleman: Aye</li>
<li>Ann Fullerton: Aye</li>
<li>Ursula Susan Fontano: Aye</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Outcome:</strong> Motion passed unanimously (5-0).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="8-103-gilman-street-hardship-variance">8. 103 Gilman Street - Hardship Variance</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Case Number:</strong> ZP25-000043</li>
<li><strong>Applicant:</strong> Robert Varian (Architect)</li>
<li><strong>Request:</strong> Seeks relief from SCO 14.1.5.c.11 Point B to expand an existing non-conforming structure further into a rear setback, requiring a hardship variance. The expansion is for 8 inches to make egress stairs code compliant.</li>
<li><strong>Background:</strong> The property is a three-family unit with existing egress stairs and rear porches in unsafe condition. To replace them and meet current code, the width of the porch needs to extend 8 inches closer to the rear property setback. The existing setback is approximately 3 feet, while 20 feet is required.</li>
<li><strong>Board Questions/Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Councilor Ann Fullerton:</strong> Noted a discrepancy between the applicant's stated 8-inch extension and the report's 14-inch figure. Kit Luster clarified that drawings show extensions of 5.5 inches (level 1), 4 inches (level 2), and 5.5 inches (level 3). Discussion clarified that the request was for relief for up to 8 inches of further encroachment.</li>
<li><strong>Fire Rating:</strong> Questioned if fire rating requirements would apply given the proximity to the property line (less than 3 feet). Robert Varian stated he would include fire-rated material if necessary.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Brian Cook:</strong> Suggested that the request for 8 inches provides a margin of error, preventing the applicant from needing to return for minor discrepancies.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Ann Fullerton:</strong> Expressed concern about the lack of precise documentation for the relief and suggested tying the approval to the specific dimensions on the architect's framing plans (6 feet 3 inches wide).</li>
<li><strong>Staff (Kit Luster):</strong> Suggested continuing the application to allow for updated plot plans to ensure accuracy, but the Board opted to proceed due to the public safety concern.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Public Comment:</strong> No members of the public raised their hand to speak.</li>
<li><strong>Hardship Criteria Findings (as discussed and adopted by the Board):</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Criterion 1 (Special circumstances):</strong> This is an existing non-conforming structure that already violates the setback. The issue is conforming to current life safety building code for egress.</li>
<li><strong>Criterion 2 (Literal enforcement creates hardship):</strong> Violating life safety is a hardship.</li>
<li><strong>Criterion 3 (Desirable relief without detriment to public good):</strong> The change is minor, rebuilding an existing egress condition, and does not affect the public good.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Motion:</strong> Ann Fullerton moved to approve the hardship variance for 103 Gilman Street, case number ZP25-000043, based on the discussed findings and special circumstances, with the special condition that the permit is granted associated with the architectural drawings dated February 21, 2025, prepared by Robert Varian Architect, specifically plan A-1 where the porch depth is noted, and adopting the criteria discussed in detail.</li>
<li><strong>Second:</strong> Ann Brockleman.</li>
<li><strong>Vote:</strong><ul>
<li>Zach Zaremba: Aye</li>
<li>Ann Brockleman: Aye</li>
<li>Cecilia Daglian: Aye</li>
<li>Ann Fullerton: Aye</li>
<li>Ursula Susan Fontano: Aye</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Outcome:</strong> Motion passed unanimously (5-0).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="9-8-8a-melvin-street-hardship-variances">9. 8-8A Melvin Street - Hardship Variances</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Case Numbers:</strong><ul>
<li>ZP25-000047: Sandy Thilkumar seeks relief from SCO 3.1.13.C regarding total dormer width standards (hardship variance).</li>
<li>ZP25-000048: Sandy Thilkumar seeks relief from SCO 3.1.13.L.1.A regarding dormer face width standards (hardship variance).</li>
<li>ZP25-000049: Sandy Thilkumar seeks relief from SCO 3.1.13.L.1.C regarding dormer separation standards (hardship variance).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Applicant:</strong> Sandy Thilkumar (Owner) and Robert Pachione (Architect).</li>
<li><strong>Background:</strong> The owner purchased the property in 2019 with plans to convert a two-family to a three-family condo. During construction, a contractor moved the third-floor kitchen location without the owner's knowledge, resulting in non-compliant dormers (e.g., dormer separation of 2 feet where 8 feet is required). The owner claims to be an investor, not a builder, and was unaware of the change until seeking a Certificate of Occupancy. Unit 1 has been sold, but COs for Units 2 and 3 are pending due to the dormer issues.</li>
<li><strong>Board Questions/Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Chair Fontano:</strong> Expressed frustration with contractors making unauthorized changes and owners claiming ignorance, emphasizing the importance of due diligence and adherence to regulations.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Zach Zaremba:</strong> Questioned how the owner could miss a 6-foot discrepancy in dormer separation, suggesting a lack of oversight.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Brian Cook:</strong> Raised concern that a professional (architect or contractor) made drawings that were not compliant with zoning, highlighting a systemic issue. Robert Pachione clarified that original drawings were by a designer, not an architect, and the contractor made changes without submitting new plans to the city.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Ann Fullerton:</strong> Expressed difficulty accepting the owner's claim of ignorance, given the multi-month nature of construction and the need for early planning (e.g., plumbing runs). Stated that only financial hardship seemed applicable, not the other hardship criteria.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Ann Brockleman:</strong> Suggested exploring minimum changes needed to bring the dormers into compliance, potentially by adjusting the left-hand dormer to meet separation requirements (50% of massing as gap).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Public Comment:</strong> No members of the public raised their hand to speak.</li>
<li><strong>Applicant Request:</strong> Sandy Thilkumar requested a continuance to allow the architect to work on a compromise solution.</li>
<li><strong>Motion:</strong> Ann Fullerton moved to continue the cases for 8-8A Melvin Street (ZP25-000047, ZP25-000048, ZP25-000049) to August 20, 2025.</li>
<li><strong>Condition for Continuance:</strong> Any revised plans must be submitted a minimum of two weeks before the August 20th hearing (by August 6, 2025) for ISD review.</li>
<li><strong>Second:</strong> Ann Brockleman.</li>
<li><strong>Vote:</strong><ul>
<li>Brian Cook: Aye</li>
<li>Zach Zaremba: Aye</li>
<li>Ann Fullerton: Aye</li>
<li>Ann Brockleman: Aye</li>
<li>Ursula Susan Fontano: Aye</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Outcome:</strong> Motion passed unanimously (5-0). Cases continued to August 20, 2025.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="10-181-pearl-street-hardship-variance">10. 181 Pearl Street - Hardship Variance</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Case Number:</strong> ZP25-000057</li>
<li><strong>Applicant:</strong> 181 Pearl Street LLC, represented by Pablo Picker (Owner/Developer) and Paul Miller (Architect).</li>
<li><strong>Request:</strong> Seeks relief from SCO 10.3.6.A.1 regarding landscape buffer requirements, which prohibits surface parking within the buffer.</li>
<li><strong>Background:</strong> The project involves building three units on a challenging corner lot. The neighbor at 4 Dana Street has a driveway that encroaches approximately 3 feet 6 inches onto the 181 Pearl Street property. The applicant designed the project to accommodate the neighbor's existing driveway as a gesture of goodwill. This encroachment violates the landscape buffer requirement.</li>
<li><strong>Proposed Design:</strong> Planters with native species along Pearl Street and Dana Street, permeable pavers, and a bench on the Pearl Street side. The design aims to provide screening and visual amenity, meeting green score requirements.</li>
<li><strong>Hardship Criteria Findings (as presented by applicant and adopted by the Board):</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Criterion 1 (Special circumstances):</strong> The neighboring driveway at 4 Dana Street encroaches on the property. 181 Pearl Street is a small corner MR3 parcel (2,024 sq ft), less than one-third the average MR3 size, with proportionally large setbacks (10-foot side setback, 12-foot curb setback) on all four sides, leaving a very small developable area.</li>
<li><strong>Criterion 2 (Literal enforcement creates hardship):</strong> Prohibiting surface parking in the buffer would require taking back the neighbor's driveway, likely leading to a legal battle and contentious relationship, which constitutes a financial and relational hardship.</li>
<li><strong>Criterion 3 (Desirable relief without detriment to public good):</strong> Granting relief does not cause detriment to the public good. The proposed landscape design provides screening, visual amenity, meets green score requirements, and buffers the site from neighbors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Public Comment:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Dinesh (Owner of 4 Dana Street):</strong> Spoke in support of the application, emphasizing that his family has used the driveway for 31 years. Removing access would cause financial burden and he is prepared to contest it legally. He implored the Board to grant the hardship.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Board Questions/Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Chair Fontano:</strong> Commended the collaboration between the applicant and neighbor. Inquired about the landscape architect and the suitability of plantings for the McGrath Highway traffic conditions. Paul Miller confirmed Ground Inc. as the landscape architect and that species are suitable.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Brian Cook:</strong> Noted that the renderings provide a good sense of the appearance and found the proposed solution acceptable, especially with the neighbor's support. Found the criteria satisfactory.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Motion:</strong> Ann Fullerton moved to approve the hardship variance for 181 Pearl Street, case number ZP25-000057, considering the findings discussed in the meeting, shared in the applicant report, and the staff memo dated July 10, 2025.</li>
