                <td> Oh, excellent. All right. Thank you so much. So my name is Devon Herrick. I am a wetland scientist with Weston and Sampson. I&#39;m here today to speak with you about the Draw 7 Park project. We&#39;ve recently undergone quite an extensive permitting process, and this project is underway. I will say that I&#39;m an environmental permitter, so I&#39;m afraid if you have design questions, I may not be able to answer them, but I will certainly do my darndest to answer any questions that you may have. um to give you a little orientation the draw seven park is located right next to assembly row and it is adjacent to the amelia earhart dam if you&#39;re familiar with that it is located right where my cursor is Plans to improve this park include updated site amenities, utilities, pedestrian connectivity. The project&#39;s also looking to address some flooding issues with the river systems that are located adjacent. This will include the development of a flood barrier that&#39;s through a natural berm, as well as creation of a living shoreline to mitigate some of the riverbank erosion that&#39;s occurring on that park&#39;s eastern side. and in general just the project is serving to increase community access with the goal of connection to the mystic river reservation greenway from an environmental perspective the site is quite interesting because it is at the confluence of title and non-title resources on the downstream side of the dam we&#39;ve got title resources and upstream non-title uh when it&#39;s completed so right now what you see in front of you is the existing conditions in the park um so it&#39;s basically wide open space you may be familiar with the fishing pier that&#39;s present that will remain it&#39;s actually going to be improved upon and there&#39;s a small parking area So let me see if I can shift. This is what the proposed conditions are due to look like. So we&#39;re looking at a variety of open lawn spaces, flexible seating, accessible pathways, shade structure, improved parking facilities, a very extensive planting plan, which I can show you on this page here. And like I said, those improvements to the shoreline and the fishing pier. So the reason I&#39;m before you here today is the last permit that we have from an environmental perspective is what&#39;s called Chapter 91. For folks that may be not so familiar with this particular permit, Chapter 91 is known as the Public Waterfront Act. It&#39;s one of the oldest pieces of environmental legislation in the country. And they particularly protect, in this case, filled tidelands and flowed tidelands. So the Mystic River adjacent to the site is a flowed tideland, meaning subject to tidal action. And part of this project is seeking to do beach cleanup and beach nourishment. So on the beach right now, there&#39;s debris in the form of bricks, glass, concrete. things along those lines. So what we&#39;re looking to do is get that cleaned up and then come back and augment the entirety of the beach area with a matching grain size material. So it&#39;s beach nourishment. We&#39;re just kind of going to be adding a thin layer of material, maximum of three inches deep, just to make the area smooth and to make sure that it&#39;s accessible for everyone. We&#39;re looking at adding approximately 397 cubic yards of material. So as part of this chapter 91 process, we need both a planning signature and a zoning signature. It&#39;s just kind of part of the standard process, just indicating that you&#39;re aware of the project and understand what&#39;s going on. Planning was kind enough to have us at their latest meeting. And so now I&#39;m here before you and I would be happy to do my darndest to answer any questions that you may have about the project.</td>

So if we are looking here on the left hand side of the screen, as you enter, we&#39;re going to have a newly configured parking area. with some nice wide accessible pathways. There&#39;s gonna be a seating area here with a nice shade structure. Those pathways will continue including pathways along the water to increase waterfront kind of access. And so people can be looking at the really lovely view that you folks have. Improved access up to this fishing pier. The fishing pier will stay the same in the same configuration, but access to the pier will be improved. This giant oval is a large circular lawn space, and it&#39;s surrounded by some of these lighter gray areas that you may be able to see are more like naturalized plantings, a little bit longer grass. It&#39;s supposed to be a bit more natural areas as opposed to manicured lawn, which is more of what we&#39;re looking at in this oval. Those pathways continue up to this circular pathway here and another circular pathway here before connecting offsite into that existing pathway that you already have.</td>

                <td>Rob Passione, Alright, so um. Let me share my PDF here so everyone can see that. So just to quickly recap, What we had submitted last time was a dormer at this kitchen area here on the third floor of the building. It&#39;s a 16 foot wide dorm which had three zoning code violations. The feedback we got from the board was that this configuration would not be approved. So we went back And we discussed it and we had our contractor come down to the site to take a look at it to see what we could do to try to modify it and kind of what the steps would be to make that happen. So what we&#39;re proposing tonight for the board&#39;s consideration is to shift the dormer wall on this side, so in the plan on the left side, over 35 inches, which would essentially drop the dormer width down to 13 foot 1 inches from 16 foot. The original approved drawings had it at 11 foot 7, so it&#39;s 1 foot 6 above where it was originally approved. Hal Hallstein, So what we would do is essentially slide this wall over we&#39;d have to you know basically modify all of these cabinets here modified the side of the kitchen island. Hal Hallstein, But we would propose for the board&#39;s consideration to keep the windows, where they are so basically push it over as far as we could to the to get as close as we could to the existing windows that are in the door now um. One thing we did note that when we resubmitted the paperwork that the 50% of the dormer ridge, the new dormer is not going over 50% of the total dormer ridge length. We actually believe we meet that requirement now by sliding this over 35 inches. But the other two items that we are still in violation of would be the dormer separation, which went from 1 foot 11 inches to 4 foot 10 inches. We&#39;re still over on that one. And then the the window ratio with the solid wall being over 36 inches. So we&#39;re a bit over on that as well. But hopefully, this improves the situation. And happy to answer any questions or hear what you guys think.</td>

They would have done it right from the beginning, not to have to go and hear it out and what have you.

Since the two hardship variances that remain are for the dormer face with and the dormer separation standards, if more adjustments can&#39;t be made to bring those into further, closer to compliance, I don&#39;t know what to do. As it is, it&#39;s really hard to stretch criterion one and criterion two of the hardship variance criteria to fit a situation like this. I mean, we have the discretion. We can do a lot with those. criteria but this is essentially trying to create a justification based on a set of decisions that were made that have nothing to do really with i mean there is some uh there are some remarks in the applicant&#39;s submission to suggest that it was the nature of the building itself that forced the design of the dormers in order to allow there to be a kitchen for there to be a full third floor apartment um i mean i If that then leads to a zoning violation, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s something that we can reasonably respond to. It&#39;s unfortunate that you have a building with a steep slope in the roof and that you have to raise it with the dormer in order to get a third floor apartment in there with a kitchen. um but that&#39;s really a problem of design and not a problem of zoning and if you can&#39;t meet the zoning requirements too we&#39;re stuck I mean we really are faced with this and cystic was all done this is you know this is as built that needs to be some um reconstruction um I&#39;m having a hard time accepting what the cry the findings for the criteria would be I agree with criteria three that there&#39;s really no uh significant detriment to the neighborhood the public good the zoning ordinance for this but the other two I have a hard time finding the language in the findings that will make it</td>

Our way of trying to address that was to say the existing structure, it was difficult to put a kitchen up there. And we had originally designed it where there was the The headroom issue so that the contractor had took it upon himself to switch it to the other side and in order to get a what we would call market rate kitchen in there. That is why they made the dormer as big as they did now we&#39;re obviously shrinking it down. So when you get a small kitchen, but the justification for was to say hey, this is, you know, to meet kind of the standards of the neighborhood of what we would expect in Somerville for a third floor unit. Hal Hallstein, We thought that the dormer needed to be this this this big so that was kind of a hardship justification so. Hal Hallstein, I know that&#39;s probably a little more out of the box and you guys used to hearing you know I know say conditions is a common common thing that comes up with archie but that was kind of what we tried to lay out in our in our findings so.</td>

And you&#39;re asking us to create a justification, which is that there was something wrong with the structure that justifies the hardship variance. So that&#39;s what we&#39;re wrestling with.

                <td>Exactly. So, PB, Harmon Zuckerman, I, I apologize because this is going to come off as Monday morning quarterbacking, but I do think there is a path that is possible. With the existing kitchen where it is, meaning with the sink in its existing place, the dishwasher in its existing place, and the range in its existing place, by just eliminating the cabinetry on the refrigerator wall, and potentially, as member Deglan suggested, tucking the refrigerator into the eave so it would just have drywall next to it. It&#39;s certainly not ideal, and you&#39;d have to relocate windows possibly put the the division the mold division between windows on the center of the sink to to make it so you don&#39;t need uh a um a variance for the window reusing those window units so you don&#39;t need a variance for the window dimension over the 12 foot dormer so I have a hard time supporting the set of hardship variances for all the same reasons everybody&#39;s been talking about. And what&#39;s also happening in the back of my mind is I can imagine a path where you can make a 12-foot dormer work for this kitchen. It&#39;s certainly not as generous as you had in whoever had originally laid it out had envisioned. But I would have a hard time supporting these variances because of that.</td>

This is your case. I don&#39;t know if you can work with them a little bit more, tweak this out, make them understand, especially the new architect. He just came on board at the last meeting. He had nothing to do with this in the past. So maybe you can give him some more direction. And so the next meeting is the 17th. We&#39;re not having one of the third. Can you guys think you have something put together on the 17th? The applicant, Robert?</td>
