<h4 id="8-melvin-street-continued-from-july-16-2025">8 Melvin Street (Continued from July 16, 2025)</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Applicant:</strong> Rob Passione (Architect) and the homeowner.</li>
<li><strong>Background:</strong> The application concerns a dormer at the kitchen area on the third floor, which previously had three zoning code violations. The Board had indicated that the original configuration would not be approved.</li>
<li><strong>Proposed Modifications:</strong><ul>
<li>Shift the dormer wall by 35 inches, reducing the dormer width from 16 feet to 13 feet 1 inch. The original approved drawings had a width of 11 feet 7 inches.</li>
<li>The applicant believes the new dormer meets the 50% of total dormer ridge length requirement.</li>
<li>Two violations remain: dormer separation (increased from 1 foot 11 inches to 4 feet 10 inches) and window ratio (solid wall over 36 inches).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Public Comment:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Speaker:</strong> [Name not provided in transcript], [Address not provided]</li>
<li><strong>Summary:</strong> Questioned how the project meets the first condition for a hardship variance, specifically regarding a compelling condition related to the building.</li>
<li><strong>Direct Quote:</strong> "I'm just curious about how this might meet the first condition for a hardship variance after looking at the analysis in the staff report regarding that as to whether there's some compelling condition relating to the building um and how it could be that um it would be necessary to to um construct this in this way so that's about all I have to say I'm just curious thanks"</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Staff Response (Madison Anthony):</strong> Stated that there is nothing about the site that gives it special circumstances to qualify for a hardship variance.</li>
<li><strong>Board Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Ann Fullerton:</strong> Acknowledged the significant change in removing one hardship request but continued to struggle with the first criterion for a hardship variance. Noted the Board's past willingness to work with residents making changes.</li>
<li><strong>Zach Zaremba:</strong> Agreed with Ann Fullerton, noting the significant changes and the applicant's good faith efforts.</li>
<li><strong>Susan Fontano:</strong> Expressed concern about projects proceeding without proper adherence to regulations, emphasizing the need for fairness to those who follow rules.</li>
<li><strong>Cecilia Daglian:</strong> Expressed concern about the "unbalanced windows" and suggested eliminating the left-hand window. Questioned why the dormer couldn't be slimmed further, noting the impact on the kitchen island. Suggested that the windows could be made conforming.</li>
<li><strong>Brian Cook:</strong> Stated difficulty in stretching Criterion 1 and Criterion 2 of the hardship variance criteria to fit this situation. Highlighted that the issue stems from design decisions, not inherent problems with the building or zoning.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Applicant/Architect Response:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Homeowner:</strong> Explained that construction occurred during COVID-19, making oversight difficult. Stated that they have done everything possible to comply without completely reconfiguring the kitchen. Noted financial hardship due to inability to sell units.</li>
<li><strong>Rob Passione (Architect):</strong> Explained that the original design aimed for a "market rate kitchen" in the third-floor unit, which necessitated the dormer size. Acknowledged that site conditions are not the primary factor but argued that the existing structure made it difficult to put a kitchen there, leading to the contractor's decision to move it.</li>
<li><strong>Brian Cook:</strong> Reiterated that the Board considers unusual structural features for Criterion 1 but was not convinced by the rationale provided.</li>
<li><strong>Ann Fullerton:</strong> Suggested that the refrigerator could potentially be tucked into the eave, and windows could be relocated to make a 12-foot dormer work, making it difficult to support the variances.</li>
<li><strong>Zach Zaremba:</strong> Requested clearer justification from the applicant on why the first condition for a hardship variance should be satisfied, specifically regarding what makes the lot, building, or order irregular.</li>
<li><strong>Board Consensus:</strong> The Board suggested the applicant provide:<ul>
<li>Pictures of the existing exterior and interior (kitchen) to illustrate how modifications inside could address exterior compliance.</li>
<li>Further documentation and brainstorming to demonstrate the "unique or unusual condition" of the structure that necessitated the changes and resulted in zoning violations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Request for Continuance:</strong> The applicant requested a continuance to allow time to gather more documentation and explore further modifications.</li>
<li><strong>Submission Deadline:</strong> For the September 17, 2025, meeting, materials should be submitted by noon on September 10, 2025. Madison Anthony clarified that she cannot perform a full compliance check, which falls under Inspectional Services Department (ISD).</li>
<li><strong>Motion:</strong> To approve the request for a continuance to the September 17, 2025, Zoning Board of Appeals meeting in the matter of 8-8A Melvin Street.</li>
<li><strong>Mover:</strong> Brian Cook</li>
<li><strong>Seconder:</strong> Ann Fullerton</li>
