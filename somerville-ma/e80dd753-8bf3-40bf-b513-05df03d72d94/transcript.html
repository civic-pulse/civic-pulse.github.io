She definitely has an understanding of planning and design practices, as well as public meeting and municipal decision-making processes. And we just think Olivia would be a really valuable addition to the current board. And I&#39;m happy to provide any answers to questions of anything regarding the ZBA if you need it.</td>

                <td>Absolutely, sure. Thank you, Chair. My name&#39;s Olivia Mobayed. I am a Somerville resident of about four and a half years. As Kit mentioned, I have my master&#39;s in city planning from the University of Pennsylvania, and I&#39;ve been a public servant in a few different capacities over the past seven and a half years. I&#39;m currently a senior project manager at the MBTA focusing on infrastructure planning. I&#39;ve worked at the MBTA for about four and a half years now. And as soon as I got the job, I knew that I wanted to live in Somerville. So moved here as soon as I possibly could. I&#39;m a renter, but I have no plans on leaving. I recently moved within the city with the intention to stay as long as I possibly can. I was first kind of involved in City of Somerville as a member of the participatory budgeting board last winter, where I got a taste of, you know, being part of a Somerville board or committee. and found the experience really rewarding and was looking for additional opportunities to be able to use my experience and expertise to better the city. I&#39;m looking forward to any additional questions you have. I will just mention that Something I&#39;m very aware of and I think mentioned pretty clearly in my application and cover letter is, you know, I am aware that there might be some slight opportunities for any kind of discrepancy in terms of, you know, conflicts of interest with my full-time job at the T. I&#39;m happy to talk about that in more detail, but I&#39;ll just mention now that I take the state conflict of interest training every two years. I&#39;m very aware of how these things work and know when to ask questions and to err on the side of caution. So I&#39;m hoping that that is not a concern when you consider my application.</td>

So I remember when the bus network redesign project was happening, there was a lot of concern, particularly on the west side of Somerville. And I think my memory is that Somerville set the record for how many public comments we submitted. Maybe we . So I guess you saw that and said, I want more of this experience. So thank you for stepping up. So actually, on that, I have a question. And then I&#39;m happy to open it up to my colleagues. How do you think about what is your general view around public comment? You know, it can be kind of you&#39;re dealing, of course, with the law. But a lot of the decisions, there&#39;s a public hearing. You hear from neighbors conflicting views. What is your kind of general approach to public comment? How do you think about that?</td>

                <td> That&#39;s a good question. Thank you, counselor. I think public comment is incredibly important in understanding the context in which decisions are being made. As a planning professional, a lot of the time we need to remind ourselves that the people we might be hearing from are not directly representative of everyone in a community, whether that be someone putting their child to bed or working a second shift and being unable to take part in something like a public meeting. But I think it&#39;s incredibly important to take the public comments into consideration when considering things like a hardship variance and understanding what the impact to the public good might be in granting one.</td>

                <td>Thank you, Mr. Chair, through you. Similar question as far as public comment goes, you know, the zoning board, you&#39;re going to get a lot of neighbors, um, both for and against a project that may impact their life directly. Um, I&#39;m curious, like, how will you weigh the desires of community members versus what you may perceive to be the needs of the community? Say someone&#39;s, a lot of people are against a project that they don&#39;t like it, but you may see some value in it or the other way around. You don&#39;t see value in a project that other people want. How will you, what&#39;s your thought process for that, I guess, is my question.</td>

I hope that as a Somerville resident for a long time and someone who understands a lot of how the city works, I can represent a portion of that component. But I think understanding the views from everyone is really important. you know, the reason why this is a board and why there are multiple folks on it means that we have the opportunity to have thoughtful discussion and discuss things together. So I don&#39;t necessarily think that, you know, my my preconceived notions of the benefits of a project should be the reason, you know, I vote yes or no. It requires from hearing from folks and discussing it and understanding. But, you know, I would say that overall, I my goal is to like take the words of the zoning ordinance um as as seriously as i can um and um think you know truthfully about like the the um the substantial hardships of the applicant versus the impact on the greater good thank you thank you counselor counselor clinton</td>

She has a graduate degree in city planning from MIT and years of planning experience in air pollution, climate planning, regulation development, and stakeholder outreach and engagement, most recently as the deputy director for the Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management. a coalition of state air agencies that promotes regional cooperation and action, and before that as a sustainability program lead with the Volpe Center. She served as chair of the Clean Energy Future Committee in Arlington when she was a resident there and has been a member of the Committee on Transportation Energy for the Transportation Research Board. We think she&#39;d bring a regional perspective to the planning board as well as expertise on transportation and climate policy and how that can manifest at the municipal and site scale. Um, with that, um, uh, Coraline, if there&#39;s anything you&#39;d like to say.</td>

And I also, too, assist in implementing Summer Vision 2040, which I think is a tremendous plan with many really great facets to it. So I also lived in Arlington for eight years. Steve mentioned that I was on the Clean Energy Future Committee. So I&#39;ve had experience planning at the municipal level with states and my work at the Northeast State for Coordinated Air-East Management at the federal level as well, and then regionally working with other states, their air pollution programs and their local districts as well.

And that message has gotten through because it is just totally extremely impressive caliber of candidates here tonight and that we&#39;ve seen coming onto the planning board and zoning board for a long time now. And you are no exception. So I guess I&#39;ll ask the same question I just did. How do you think about public comment? How does it kind of influence your decisions?

                <td>Yeah, I mean, public comment is absolutely critical in the formation of policies. And I think also in kind of the effective implementation of policies. So through the comment period, you get a diversity of opinions. And as Olivia pointed out, sometimes you don&#39;t have the diversity that you would like and conducting outreach to try and boost participation and get more comments, I think is really important because if you go into implementing a policy and you haven&#39;t gotten enough input from the community, A, you can run into issues because you haven&#39;t heard enough. You haven&#39;t heard the perspective of the people who are going to live with the policy and you haven&#39;t heard potential issues that might come up. And so you haven&#39;t gathered enough information. So getting that diversity of opinion is especially important. And I would just support the comment that trying to increase participation by offering, you know, online forums or after work, or maybe it&#39;s a Saturday or, you know, different approaches to get those public comments in is really essential. And then in my experience, my work experience, we often had to address every single public comment, even in, you know, federal rule making where there could be, you know, thousands and thousands of comments. And I&#39;d say, even though that process is long and takes time, it really makes the regulators or whoever is going to be working on this policy or implementing it or putting it in place, think a lot about the policy. So that&#39;s an important process.</td>

And this is kind of, I don&#39;t know, maybe open-ended, but what do you think, how do you think about questions about what we call density, right? This is probably one of the things we hear most about as policymakers here on the city council is around the density of new development. And you get really strong opinions anytime that there&#39;s a project that some people consider too dense or other people consider kind of wasted opportunity. It&#39;s a very general, broad question, but can you just walk us through how you think about that question in the context of Somerville?</td>

                </td>
                <td>Yeah. Well, I think that changes in density, again, going back to the public input process, it&#39;s very important to to get community input on any changes, because again, you want the policy to work once it&#39;s implemented. And so I would say that in general, I think that increasing density is a great way, can be a great tool, to increase housing. And it can be done intelligently through inclusionary housing, for example, inclusionary zoning, so that there could be density bonus in certain areas to add more housing or more affordable housing. I think there are a number of tools in the toolbox to think about density. You can kind of put it in certain places like new developments that are, you know, have a lot of height so that you get more affordable housing. So that&#39;s kind of one of the tools to have it in certain places. And so I think that you just need to think about how you&#39;re going to add that density. But in general, I think it can be a really terrific tool to improve housing at a time when we really need it. Thank you for that.</td>

I think you probably touched on it a little bit when you were answering the good councilor of the chair.

So I think that implementing some of the policies that are already on the books, like the bike lane plan, the 80 plus miles of bike lanes, implement that, you know, those kinds of plans that are already on the books will really help kind of knit together the transit oriented development with alternative modes and increase the opportunity for residents to travel without a car. So give, give residents more opportunities. And then, and I think, you know, there&#39;s, I&#39;ve been listening in on, you know, kind of the discussions around some of the bus routes, like 80, 90, what happens to those routes and, We need to make sure that East Somerville has service, and yet some of those routes may need to change. So I think that continuing to be engaged in any planning around bus routes and making sure that Somerville has the access it needs and access to buses and then alternative transit, Again, making the city more walkable, so making, you know, crossing safer as has been done in many places already, but kind of continuing the effort to make walking, biking safer, which increases access to transit and, you know, reducing the danger in areas where crossings make pedestrians and bicyclists especially vulnerable.</td>

I&#39;m always interested in the Planning Board&#39;s response to affordable housing and the role of housing, say, beyond the expectation of what we currently have. How would you look at, I guess in general, a project that comes before the planning board and maybe gives more affordable housing than is required. What would your thought process be when looking at a project like that? Sorry if I&#39;m not making sense, but I basically want to see planning board members be supportive of affordable housing.</td>

All right, colleagues, so we have a number of promotions within the police department now, and I wanted to start with a procedural suggestion. So this is obviously up to the will of the committee. So since I&#39;ve been chairing this committee, we have a process when we&#39;re dealing with promotions within the department for people who have already been serving and are now being promoted to a new role, where for each candidate, we go into executive session so that counselors can review if there have been any complaints against the officer or a candidate. The outcomes of those can hear responses. I think that that&#39;s been, for me, a very important practice. I also have been made aware recently that an alternative way to do it is that outside the context of a meeting, counselors, including myself as chair, can meet with the chief, review, ask questions about these issues to see if there&#39;s any information that might affect my vote. And I can say I have done that for all the candidates that are on the agenda tonight. I&#39;ve reviewed these candidates with the chief. um and i as one counselor am totally comfortable not going into executive session for these candidates because i&#39;ve had all my questions answered And it is 100% up to the will of the committee. It&#39;s in order to move to go into executive session if there are counselors who would like to ask those questions. It is also totally fine for us to have our meeting in open session. And going forward, if other counselors wish to have these conversations as well, they can do it outside of the meeting. And this is really just a kind of time-saving approach. So I&#39;m curious to hear if colleagues are all right with that. Counselor Clingan.</td>

But these can be reviewed in the. outside of a meeting with the chief, with the solicitor. So if going forward, colleagues do have questions, absolutely possible to do that.

I&#39;d like to also recognize the other committee members that are here this evening. We greatly appreciate your time. Cumulatively, all of the candidates tonight represent over 137 years of combined service to the city of Somerville and the Somerville Police Department. In the case of Deputy Levy, he is someone who is serving in an acting capacity now to help the department move forward. I greatly appreciate him stepping up in that space. I&#39;d also like to recognize his continued service over the years in rising through the ranks. I haven&#39;t served at every rank, most recently commanding the Criminal Investigations Division. Deputy Levy is a true partner in the work that we are doing. He has shown an openness and willingness to change as well as look forward thinking. into the 21st century around ways in which we can be innovative with the policing that we do in a way that represents the true value set and tolerance of this community. With that said, Mr. Chair, I do present Richard Levy as a candidate for deputy chief.</td>

                <td> So we&#39;ve been really working hard in the police department to build on police legitimacy and creating trust. Chief Benford, through his leadership, he&#39;s a real forward thinker. I&#39;m happy to be part of his team. We&#39;re gonna try and build out to the extent we can our community policing unit. As you know, we&#39;ve had a number of activities that we&#39;ve engaged in, including the Junior Police Academy, which was a great success. We were involved at the end of last school season with doing a tutorial in multiple different languages for the kids at the Winter Hill Innovation School at the Edgeley. We spoke with eighth graders in three different languages to try and reach out with them. And this was at the request of the school principal. So, you know, we will be excited to get back into that space again to create trust We&#39;re always up against it, as you know. As difficult as it is, we work hard to earn people&#39;s trust, not violate it. And all the things you see going on with ICE, all it takes is them to come in and do something. And it kind of hurts us a little bit, turns the clock back on us. It&#39;s very frustrating for us. People are scared. especially members of our minority communities that are maybe not here under legal status. It creates a lot of distrust. We&#39;re working hard through things like National Night Out, and we&#39;re going to be building up on our community policing efforts and going forward this next bid cycle. And I&#39;m hoping we can make some good inroads, building trust with the community. That seems like, you know, you take two steps forward and one step back, but we&#39;re always coming up with new ideas, forward thinking, positive messaging. We have a very young department now. It was older some years ago, when I came up to a Lieutenant and Captain, we have a very young department. And diversifying those ranks and diversifying our supervisory ranks are the way to connect with people. People like to see people in charge who look like them, talk like them, have the same culture. These all work towards building trust with the community.</td>

You have to understand both your own strengths and weaknesses, your values, and, you know, You have to be transparent. You have to treat people fairly. You have to provide accountability without hitting people over the head. People want to be treated fairly. I&#39;ve never asked anybody to do anything I wouldn&#39;t do myself in this department. I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll find anyone to say anything negative in that space about my standards on being ethical and building relationships, not just with our officers, with people in the community, business owners, stakeholders, other stakeholders are, are nonprofit, uh, folks, uh, like respond and maps, um, building relationships and being authentic. Um, this helps with community policing. It enhances it. Um, officer wellbeing, um, chief infant has put that forward, uh, One of his first questions, Chief Penfield asked, always, no matter what conversation we&#39;re having is, how are you doing? How is your family doing? It&#39;s truly authentic. And, you know, I think we can create accountability. We have created accountability using progressive discipline. And, you know, towards that end, we&#39;re better service providers and people want to work here. It&#39;s been a difficult task recruiting and retaining people in this career field nationally. And, you know, Somerville is a very progressive community. And our number one asset here is our staff and our personnel. They&#39;re our biggest asset. That&#39;s how we make inroads with the community. And my views are the thousand foot view. It&#39;s very different being the deputy chief, even compared to a captain. The duties are very different. I&#39;m up for the challenge. And, you know, I&#39;d like to move some, help some of them move forward with Chief Benford&#39;s leadership and guide us in the right path.</td>

And just through your chair, I just want to make a commentary here that, you know, Interim Deputy Chief Levy, I&#39;ve been in the U.S. in aggregate like about 15 years. So one of my early jobs, you know, my supervisor will ask me, well, how are you feeling? How are you doing? But they were not interested because by the time I tried to explain how I was doing, they almost got offended that that&#39;s somebody&#39;s job. Somebody&#39;s being paid to actually know how I&#39;m actually really doing. So I&#39;m not going to buy that statement that Chief Benford said, how are you doing? How are you doing? There&#39;s a standard response for that question. So you have to revise how you ask that question because nobody has the patience to just get to actually listen to you talk about how you&#39;re doing. In fact, that&#39;s the way I learned about the system. So maybe it&#39;s changing in your department, but I just want to give you my take about how... i tried to explain how i was doing and my supervisor got really it means that he has another problem to deal with because he was like running towards the meeting and then i have to get stuck with me trying to figure out like how to you know like deal with my own mental health so uh just just as a caveat but i&#39;ll be supporting you thank you for coming forward i&#39;m excited about your candidacy thank you councilman appreciate it thank you</td>

That&#39;s what I see is our biggest thing to overcome. But we&#39;ve been working hard at it. We&#39;re using an alternative hiring process now, in addition to the standard civil service practice. So we&#39;re really attractive now to the community Younger officers that maybe are already trained that work for a campus police department. They&#39;re highly educated. They&#39;re young. They bring progressive values. They have a different way of thinking. Gen Z is a very different police officer than when I first came on here and what was here. All they wanted to do was work, work, work. Gen Z, to their credit, they have found ways to find better balance with life. Um, they&#39;re not concerned with making $250,000 there. They, they want job satisfaction, um, and they find it in different ways than Gen X did. So, um, working with Gen Z, uh, we&#39;re basically preparing the future of policing, uh, in Somerville and, uh, across the land. And I think that&#39;s the biggest, um, thing we have to look at and is preparing these kids to be the new leaders. So it&#39;s a young person&#39;s job for sure.</td>

Off the campus brings 12 years of experience to the department. As the deputy mentioned, part of the role and the job that we have is to mentor our future professionals and our future leaders. And in SPD, one of the areas that we&#39;re extremely deficient in is in women supervisors, women in leadership. It has been a priority to try and create pathways for leadership with women. When we talk about diversity, equity, and inclusion, it&#39;s not just on a racial level, it&#39;s on a gender level. in a multitude of different levels to ensure that we can bring about greater equity. Certainly, Officer Campers has earned the opportunity to present and compete for this position before this committee, but it is truly a pleasure. Officer Campers is clearly a leader amongst her colleagues, and I believe that serving in the capacity of the sergeant is going to help position this department for the future as we welcome her as a partner and certainly use her as a steward and an advocate as we look to promote as well as encourage additional females to join the ranks of the SPD, but also those that are here take the supervisory exams so that we can help realize greater balance and equity at the supervisory ranks for females. With that said, Mr. Chair, I&#39;d like to formally present our candidate, Cassandra Campers, for the rank of sergeant.</td>

                <td>Thank you very much. Again, it gives me a great honor to recommend a. Officer Patrick Canty, for the role and promotion to the rank of sergeant. It really bears mentioning the unequivocal work that Officer Canty has done with our youth and working in some of our marginalized communities, particularly over in the mystics. He&#39;s extremely well respected in that community and with the young persons. He&#39;s shown a tremendous commitment to working with those young persons. And I look for that to be elevated on a leadership level and for him to not only use his informal leadership ability that he has, with his officers, but also amongst his peers, but to also use him now as a supervisor to help engender individuals to want to join us and really following his lead. Officer Canty comes from a long history of family members that have served in the law enforcement community. He has other family members that represent his family line in the SPD. It is certainly a pleasure to work alongside him. He&#39;s been extremely responsive to all the asks that we put on the table. He serves in a multitude of different specialty capacities and helping us meet our mandate. I think that it will be a compliment to the department and look forward to working with him and continuing to develop this department into the 21st century. It gives me great pleasure to present Officer Canty, recommended for the rank of sergeant before the committee.</td>

So when we first started out with the community police and working with the kids, we had a lot of doubt and nobody thought that they would welcome us or want us down there. And just by showing up and listening to them and have an open dialogue and answering questions. We mentioned earlier about transparency and policing. I think that&#39;s the most important thing we can do is be transparent and explain why we&#39;re doing things when we&#39;re doing them. But just having an open dialogue with the youth, I think that I can show the younger officers that this stuff really works. And if you believe in it and you commit to it, you can make a big difference.</td>

And you have to be able to be monitor their performance now, whereas before they looked at you as a peer, now you&#39;re a boss. And I think you have to separate the personal from from the work life. And I think that would probably be a challenge more. I&#39;ve done it in other jobs, so I think I&#39;m well versed in it, but for some of the guys who have seen me as their peer, now I&#39;m gonna have to monitor their performance and provide like a constructive criticism without alienating them or making them mad.

Officer Costa has worked in a number of specialized units through some very difficult periods in policing. He has had to traverse that and has emerged as a much more refined police candidate and informal leader He is someone that comes into the role with great temperament, well respected amongst his peers. Additionally, as we look towards the future, I expect that we&#39;ll be able to rely on his plethora of temperament and demeanor, as well as his respect amongst his peers to help guide and mentor young persons. and new officers as they come into the department, convincing them to be partners with us and the community as we look to promote and move the department forward. Again, as I have with all candidates, Officer Costas worked very hard in emerging and arriving at this juncture to be a viable candidate, and it gives me great pleasure to recommend his candidacy for the rank of Sergeant.</td>

Detective Tease has shown an energy and a passion for accountability and wanting to move us and this department into the 21st century and being held at the highest levels of accountability and professionalism. He&#39;s been extremely patient in the opportunity while honing his craft in this area. I believe that his breadth of experience with detail and having to answer for each and every item that we put our hands on just as we&#39;re held accountable to the community is going to be an invaluable tool and asset that he brings to the role as he moves into this next position, presumably, if he is confirmed. I look forward to working with him. I look forward to him bringing his professionalism and his temperament to the role and helping us move the department forward again into the 21st century. And it gives me great pleasure to present Detective Teaves to this committee for recommendation to the rank of sergeant.</td>

I&#39;ve always been a hands-on type of person. I always like to work alongside my peers and my partners, even if it is in a supervisory position. And I&#39;ve had a lot of supervisors that have given me leeway to actually accomplish goals on my own and allow me to experience the joys and the benefits that come from accomplishing a set goal. And I think it&#39;s a lot more impactful when somebody does something on their own as opposed to like, yeah, I did it, but my supervisor helped me with like 75% of it. I think that takes away from it a little bit. So I think that one of my biggest goals is just to be able to delegate without really getting my hands in there. I mean, obviously, if somebody is having an issue with a task that they have been set to, I would definitely be there to help, to assist, to guide them. but I would want them to complete as much of the task at hand as humanly possible. Therefore, they get the benefit of doing it and they get to experience that joy of completing something that was assigned to them. So I think that&#39;s probably going to be my biggest uphill battle is just being able to delegate and then take a step back without actually having my hands in the mix.</td>

Sergeant DeFava, most recently over the past several years, has committed an enormous amount of professional and personal capital to helping this department realize reaccreditation. It is one of the jobs that is not highly sought after. It requires a tedious and a tremendous dedication to detail and working through mundane processes to ensure that this department is submitted to the best practices in policing to marry up with the stellar service that our officers provide. Officer, excuse me, Sergeant DeFava has done that with distinction and really oversaw us in conjunction with a number of other assets that supported him in helping this department receive reaccreditation. Throughout his career, Sergeant DeFava in service to this city, has paid their price, both physically and mentally, in service to this city, will forever be indebted for some of the sacrifices that he&#39;s made. I believe that he is going to be a true asset in his role as a lieutenant, and I look forward to working with him and continuing to mentor and learn from him, and also working in partnership with him and helping us move the department forward. It gives me great pleasure to present to this committee, Sergeant Tafava, again, for the promotion to the rank of lieutenant.</td>

So, Sergeant Defava, you want me to ask you one or two questions? Should I save the two questions for Captain Perrone or should I just start hitting, you know, because the last three, you guys are all heavy hitters here. So tell me, one question or two, this is not a lottery for you. uh whatever you want to counsel we&#39;ll go with the two i&#39;ll take the uh amazing amazing is it a chair you see when you get like a stellar officer okay you bring it bring it on okay so i and and again this is just you know um again you are our boys so it just kind of like it may help us understand your approach to like how you you you govern as a superior officer So, for example, how would you approach balancing administrative duties with active engagement in field operation?</td>

I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT AS OVER THE PAST YEAR AS WE REALLY STARTED TO LOOK AT BETTER WAYS TO KEEP OUR COMMUNITY SAFE, WE HAD TO CHANGE POSTURE IN TERMS OF HOW WE WERE APPROACHING PUBLIC SAFETY IN A WAY THAT GAVE US THE STRONGEST POSTURE THAT WE COULD PUT FORWARD but not presented in a way so that individuals felt over policed but felt safe in being able to come into our city or come out of their homes and enjoy the community. Sergeant Isidoro met the moment. There were lots of changes and pivots that we needed to make. He never once said no. He doubled down, answered the call, follow the orders, but most importantly, became proficient and competent and knowledgeable in the areas that we were asking him to grow in. One of his stronger assets that we hear from colleagues that have worked alongside him and for him is that he&#39;s a very strong commander and will be a very indelible leader as he goes into this role. He continues to report, continues to perform at a high level. We&#39;re looking forward to him partnering with us and helping us use his plethora of experience in guiding some of our newer officers so that they, in turn, become future leaders and professionals for tomorrow. It gives me great pleasure in presenting Sergeant Isidoro to this committee for confirmation to the rank of lieutenant.</td>

                <td> So, just to touch on a little bit of what you said, Councilor Armbau, obviously you&#39;ve been a great partner to me and our police department for a long period of time. We&#39;re living proof that we can have difficult conversations and really come up with some great ideas that are in the best interest of our community. I do think that in terms of challenges, I&#39;ve obviously led the Office of Professional Standards for a significant period of time now through some really difficult times in this community. And I think it&#39;s so important for us to build trust and legitimacy. We&#39;re still in that process of building that trust and legitimacy within our community. I have seen that come around and I think it&#39;s been really important for our officers to get out and engage the community. And I know you and I have appeared together at community meetings last fall, and you&#39;ve introduced me to some of your constituents, and I&#39;ve listened to their ideas and brought those back to the department. We need to continue to do that because this police department can&#39;t function and can&#39;t deliver excellent service without being a true partner to the community. The community decides how, make no mistake, community decides how we police them. And it&#39;s extremely important for us to sort of further that here within the community. I do think that, you know, we do have to learn how to sort of tighten our belts and do more with less. And I think our offices are prepared to do that, especially as some of my colleagues have said tonight, we do have a young department that&#39;s extremely energetic and open to new ideas and doing things differently. And I think that I&#39;ve been a leader to them sort of as I&#39;ve risen up through the ranks here within the police department, and as we bring new officers online here in the future, I plan to continue to do that, continue to sort of foster that dialogue between the community and our officers. So I think that&#39;s the plan moving forward, and I look forward to working with all of you to do that.</td>

What I&#39;ve started to notice as I&#39;ve engaged with the public over the past couple of years, sort of as we&#39;ve come out of some trying times where the community may have lost trust in its police officers, I&#39;ve noticed that people are starting to engage with us again. They&#39;re starting to, you know, I don&#39;t wanna say show appreciation, but they wanna be more engaged with us and they wanna be part of the future of what public safety looks like. And as we start to work towards these goals like public safety for all and things like that, I think that The success comes when our community members want to engage with us and want to be part of the solution. And in my view, I measure that in part, and then I measure the satisfaction of our officers, seeing how our officers&#39; morale has sort of built up over the last couple of years, seeing how they come to work every day. squared away and ready to go and happy to serve the community. So when you take those two things, the positive community sentiment with the boosted morale of our officers, I think we&#39;re really moving in the right direction as a police department.</td>

                <td>Taking on this new role. Well, I do think, as Deputy Levy mentioned, recruitment and retention. And I&#39;ve worked extensively on that process over the last year of trying to bring in new offices. That&#39;s definitely a challenge. And it seems like we&#39;re always running uphill in that area. And that does put a strain on other roles. At some point or another, in an executive leadership role, I am going to be leading a unit that probably will be strapped for resources over a short period or a longer period of time. And I&#39;m going to have to figure out how to contend with that. It&#39;s never been something I&#39;ve ever run from. I&#39;ve always been a problem solver and somebody who has been able to find solutions to those difficult problems. And I&#39;m confident that I&#39;ll be able to do that in this role. As I said, I think we need to continue in our efforts to build trust and legitimacy within the community. I think as an executive leader, I think there&#39;s more layers to supervise. Every time you move up in rank within a police department, more units tend to fall under you. And I expect that that will happen. I am prepared to do that. As I&#39;ve said, I&#39;ve led this department through some pretty difficult challenges, such as the implementation of the Police Reform Act. We&#39;ve reformed the way in which we handle professional standards. I think I&#39;ve shown that I am able to take on those most difficult challenges. And last but not least, just understanding the resources that are available to us as executives. We have to manage those resources. And with that, I mean people and money. I am prepared to do that. I know you all have looked at my resume. I have worked in the finance industry in the past, and I think I&#39;ve shown that I&#39;ve been able to run units within the police department pretty efficiently.</td>
