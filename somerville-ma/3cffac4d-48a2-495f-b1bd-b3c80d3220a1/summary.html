<ul>

<li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Instant reaction, convening an incident command system, and activating an emergency operations center.</li>
<li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Utilizing the Tufts Administrative Building (TAB) for immediate instructional needs, as Tufts has cleared it for this use and it has existing classrooms.</li>
<li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Mobilizing quickly to move in and out of the TAB, leveraging past experience.</li>

<h3 id="3-5-and-6-jenny-smithers-pool-updates">3., 5., and 6. Jenny Smithers Pool Updates</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong> Chief of Staff Nikki Spencer and Director of Operations Yanni Tseregatis provided a comprehensive update on the Jenny Smithers Pool, addressing items 3, 5, and 6.<ul>
<li><strong>Memo Summary:</strong> A memo detailing improved procedures, cleanliness, and teamwork at the pool was submitted.</li>
<li><strong>Schedule Alteration:</strong> DPW and Parks &amp; Recreation recommend altering the pool schedule to close one day during the week and expand weekend hours. This will allow for dedicated maintenance and adjustments. The specific day off will be finalized based on lower attendance and avoiding impact on school swimming lessons.</li>
<li><strong>Lifeguard Manual:</strong> The lifeguard manual has been updated by Director Tseregatis, vetted by ISD and DPW, to ensure proper procedures for chemical testing and reporting.</li>
<li><strong>Chemical Spill (June):</strong> The cause was identified as human error due to overfilling a muriatic acid tank. An improperly stored chlorine bottle was also found.<ul>
<li><strong>Actions Taken:</strong> DPW and Parks &amp; Recreation clarified tank limits, reviewed chemical storage protocols, and DPW installed a shutoff valve on the water hose in the storage closet.</li>
<li><strong>After-Action Exercise:</strong> Director of Emergency Management Bill Fisher will convene an after-action exercise to train and improve protocols with relevant departments.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Councillor Sait's Questions:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>One-Day Closure:</strong> The closure will be implemented soon and is a best practice, not solely due to the lack of a director. It allows for coordinated maintenance and avoids programming interruptions.</li>
<li><strong>Role Delineation:</strong> Roles for Parks &amp; Recreation and DPW have been redelineated and retrained, focusing on chemical balance testing (four times daily by Parks &amp; Rec, occasionally by DPW), routine cleaning, and strengthened communication protocols for urgent issues.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Councillor Davis's Comments:</strong> Expressed constituent frustration regarding ongoing pool issues but acknowledged the efforts. Noted the human error cause of the spill and hoped for improved training and procedures with a new director. Questioned the cost-effectiveness of the one-day closure versus other options.</li>
<li><strong>Councillor Sait's Follow-up:</strong> Inquired about rescheduling classes canceled during past closures. Nikki Spencer stated that efforts have been made to improve communication with users and that anyone who missed a class should have received a follow-up. She encouraged individuals needing support to reach out.</li>
<li><strong>Councillor Clingan's Questions:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Staff Changes:</strong> Acknowledged some staff departures but stated the Parks &amp; Recreation team continues daily operations.</li>
<li><strong>Outside Contractor:</strong> Commissioner Jill Lathan confirmed that outside contractors have always been used for complex pool systems (e.g., Western Samson, Wolfpack).</li>
<li><strong>Contractor Responsibility:</strong> Commissioner Lathan clarified that Parks &amp; Recreation staff are primarily responsible for chemical testing and balances, with DPW supporting.</li>
<li><strong>Deep Cleaning Schedule:</strong> DPW plans to return to an August schedule for deep cleaning and system maintenance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>School Committee Questions:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Third-Grade Swim Lessons:</strong> Dr. Phillips asked about the impact of the one-day closure on third-grade swim lessons. Yanni Tseregatis stated they are working to avoid conflicts and that make-up lessons from last year are difficult due to students advancing grades.</li>
<li><strong>Coordination with SPS:</strong> Amaria Onosike (Chief of Staff, SPS) confirmed ongoing communication with Parks &amp; Recreation regarding scheduling.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Outcome:</strong> Work complete.</li>

<h3 id="8-msba-process-for-the-winter-hill-and-brown-schools">8. MSBA Process for the Winter Hill and Brown Schools</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong> Director Ralph Henry provided an update on the Massachusetts School Building Authority (MSBA) process for the Winter Hill and Brown Schools.<ul>
<li><strong>Owner's Project Manager (OPM):</strong> PMA is fully under contract and has begun work, leveraging their experience from the high school project.</li>
<li><strong>Designer Selection:</strong> A Request for Services (RFS) for designers (architects and disciplines) received six responses, indicating high interest.</li>
<li><strong>Selection Process:</strong> The MSBA-driven selection panel, including Dr. Carmona, Director Henry, and Courtney Koslow (Winter Hill parent and School Building Committee member), shortlisted six firms to three. Interviews are scheduled for September 25th, after which a top firm will be selected for contract negotiations.</li>
<li><strong>Construction Advisory Group (CAG):</strong> The CAG has continued to meet, examining building size and location.</li>
<li><strong>Community Survey:</strong> A second community survey, developed in collaboration with the CAG, is in the field and has received a high response rate. It will close the day after interviews, with data provided to the CAG for final consideration. The first survey's data is available but not heavily weighted due to methodological flaws.</li>
<li><strong>Councillor Davis's Concerns:</strong> Expressed concern that conversations might be steering towards a single option. Highlighted the significant red flag of combining the two smallest schools into potentially the largest, and the impact of closing the only school in Ward 6. Stated he would actively campaign against such a plan.</li>
<li><strong>Councillor Clingan's Clarification:</strong> Confirmed that the CAG makes a recommendation to the Mayor, who is a voting member of the MSBA board and will bring an informed decision to that body.</li>
<li><strong>Passive House Experience:</strong> Councillor Clingan noted that some top design firms may lack extensive Passive House experience and urged the committee to inquire about this during interviews.</li>
<li><strong>"A Team" vs. "B Team":</strong> Councillor Clingan raised concerns about firms presenting an "A team" during selection but deploying a "B or C team" after contract award, asking if stipulations could be made.</li>
<li><strong>St. Ann's School:</strong> Councillor Clingan inquired if one firm's concept included the St. Ann's School building, and Director Henry confirmed it was a creative concept, acknowledging the need for archdiocese cooperation.</li>
<li><strong>Timeline Comparison:</strong> School Committee Chair Betone asked why Somerville's MSBA process seemed slower than other communities. Director Henry explained that every project is unique, Somerville has more complex requirements due to city ordinances, and the CAG's parallel work may ultimately save time in the feasibility study phase.</li>
<li><strong>Ms. Patone's Comments:</strong> Emphasized the complexity of the CAG's recommendations, considering values, potential losses/gains of combining schools, addressing risks of old buildings, enhancing inclusion, and significant financial implications. Stressed that the survey is not a vote but a data point.</li>
<li><strong>Survey Data Weighting:</strong> Ms. Patone asked if survey data would be weighted to reflect the demographics of Somerville residents. Director Henry confirmed demographic tracking and targeted outreach to underrepresented groups. Nikki Spencer added that consultants are working with SummerStat to determine the best analytical approach.</li>
<li><strong>Abutter Outreach:</strong> Councillor Sait requested information on outreach to abutters of proposed school locations. Director Henry committed to providing this information at a future meeting.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Outcome:</strong> Kept in committee.</li>
