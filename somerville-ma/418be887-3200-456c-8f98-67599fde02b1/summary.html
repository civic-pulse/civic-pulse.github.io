<h4 id="3-5-6-ginny-smithers-pool-updates-combined-discussion">3, 5, &amp; 6. Ginny Smithers Pool Updates (Combined Discussion)</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Item 3:</strong> That the Director of Parks and Recreation report to this council on the cause of the chemical spill at the Jenny Smithers pool in the process to address the cause of the spill and prevent future occurrence.</li>
<li><strong>Item 5:</strong> (Not explicitly read, but discussed as part of the holistic pool update)</li>
<li><strong>Item 6:</strong> That the administration report to this council on the cause of the reported chemical imbalance at the Ginnie Smithers pool and process being used to address the imbalance.</li>
<li><strong>Presenters:</strong> Nikki Spencer (Chief of Staff), Yanni Tseregatis (Director of Operations, Parks and Recreation), Jill Latham (DPW Commissioner), Bill Fisher (Director of Emergency Management).</li>
<li><strong>Key Discussion Points:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Chemical Spill Cause:</strong> Nikki Spencer reported the June chemical spill was due to "human error via overfilling of a tank of muriatic acid in the storage closet." An improperly stored bottle of chlorine was also found.</li>
<li><strong>Safety Measures:</strong> DPW and Parks and Rec clarified tank limits, reviewed chemical storage protocols, and DPW installed a shutoff valve on the water hose in the closet. Parks and Rec also wet-vacuumed remaining water.</li>
<li><strong>Emergency Response:</strong> Director of Emergency Management Bill Fisher confirmed he was notified immediately and responded to the school. He stated, "the one thing that worked fairly very well is the response. In the response, the alerting, the evacuation was done through an abundance of caution and concern to make sure that those kids and staff are safe." No toxic fumes were detected.</li>
<li><strong>Operational Changes:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Schedule Alteration:</strong> Parks and Rec and DPW recommend altering the pool schedule by closing for one day during the week to allow for dedicated maintenance and expanding weekend hours. This is a "best practice" seen in other communities, not solely due to the absence of a director.</li>
<li><strong>Lifeguard Manual:</strong> The lifeguard manual has been updated to be more user-friendly, vetted by ISD and DPW, and is a "living document."</li>
<li><strong>Roles and Responsibilities:</strong> Roles between Parks and Rec and DPW have been redelineated, with Parks and Rec staff testing chemical balance four times daily and DPW staff occasionally conferring. Communication protocols for urgent maintenance issues have been strengthened.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Maintenance Vendor:</strong> Commissioner Latham confirmed the city uses an outside contractor for complex pool systems maintenance.</li>
<li><strong>Deep Cleaning Schedule:</strong> The deep cleaning will return to an August schedule, as it is the "best time to do that."</li>
<li><strong>Staffing:</strong> There have been "some departures" in pool maintenance staff.</li>
<li><strong>Communication:</strong> Improvements have been made in communicating with pool users regarding closures and activities.</li>
<li><strong>Third-Grade Swim Lessons:</strong> The new pool schedule is being coordinated to avoid conflict with third-grade swim lessons. Make-up lessons from last year's closures are difficult to arrange due to students advancing grades, but the department will follow up with individuals who missed classes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Outcome:</strong> Work complete.</li>
</ul>
