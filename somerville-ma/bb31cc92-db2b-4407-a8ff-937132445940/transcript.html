We&#39;re going to take up agenda item eight. That&#39;s ID number 25-1449. The mayor requesting the appropriation of $240,664.10 from the Transportation Network Company Special Revenue Fund for the FY2026 Vision Zero Safety efforts. We have with us, I see Director Brad Rawson from Mobility. Director Rawson, you want to take this one?</td>

                <td> Yes, Chair. Good evening through you. Thanks to the committee for managing your agenda. I know many of us have multiple meetings on a given evening, and I appreciate your forbearance here. So, Chair, the Finance Committee is aware that the state has utilized something called a special revenue fund. Ever since the legislature voted into law, the operation of transportation network companies, what we all think of as ride-hailing apps, Uber and Lyft being the dominant players in that industry, And the Finance Committee will recall that approximately 20 cents per trip is added as a surcharge to those trips, 10 cents of which, Chair, is issued to the municipality in which the ride-hailing trip begins. So every Uber and Lyft trip that begins in Somerville, 10 cents will flow to the Commonwealth and then be redistributed to Somerville, subject to your annual appropriation and acceptance. Typically, Chair, Somerville has received between $200,000 and $300,000 of this special revenue source. And the legislature&#39;s law does require cities and towns to use those special revenue funds to mitigate negative impacts of the ride hailing industry. So typically Somerville has used those funds for three major areas of our work chair. One is design and engineering for our safe streets projects. The second is for planning or data collection tasks to support that design and engineering. And third could be for project implementation, often in the form of flex post purchases, pavement markings, things of the like. So we just wanted to provide that quick summary. So we&#39;re here to seek your approval to accept the most recent tranche of funding from the Commonwealth This would bring us current for all ride-hailing trips that begin in Somerville in calendar year 2024. The Commonwealth tends to run about 15 months behind in terms of dispersing those funds, so we only found out about this in June of 2025. Chair, I hope that&#39;s a helpful background and summary, and I&#39;m happy to answer questions that the committee may have. Absolutely. Thanks for that.</td>

Um, when I, when I saw this, I asked myself, like, you know, I think we already have this appropriation in the budget. So I&#39;m wondering if this, you know, like, does this pay for discrete, you know, like all these other, like. So does this money offset any CIP project costs? You&#39;ve mentioned those design and engineering flex posts. I think we already have an appropriation for this in our budget. So I&#39;m wondering, what else is this? If this is additional funds, you know it&#39;s actually going to offset some maybe capital improvement project cause essentially allowing us to borrow less money for street improvements or like how does it fit into like the bigger picture goals of, you know, or is this adding to your division, you know, or maybe like the highway division budget fund to cover the regular programs of street and side. So you&#39;ve mentioned the three major category, but I think we appropriate these funds already during budget season. Can you just expand shade, like how this is going to, If this is an enhancement or like is it going to what is what&#39;s the difference between a budget appropriation for street improvement and then with this additional funds?</td>

                <td> Chair, through you, thanks for the question and for the compliments, Councillor. The TNC Special Revenue Funds should be thought of as supplemental and in addition to any operating budget sources that the Council has worked with us on over the years. Chair, I&#39;ll note that Mobility Division&#39;s operating budget for things like design and engineering tasks typically runs at about $300,000 a year. And the finance committee will recall that those design funds typically go to support engineering divisions, annual street and sidewalk contracts. The TNC funds has typically been used to support our quick build program, which is typically not handled through our operating budget. So it&#39;s definitely complimentary and additive. I hope that&#39;s a helpful answer to the question.</td>

Let&#39;s take up then our second agenda item, ID number 25-1462. It&#39;s a mayor requesting approval to extend and amend a contract with City Hall Systems for an additional two years until December 17, 2027 for online bill payment services. I believe the clerk is loading up here a memo. Well, that&#39;s the Arts Council one. There we go, there&#39;s the memo that I was about to reference. It should be uploaded into Legistar as well, our legislative tracking system. Explaining this request, hopefully colleagues had a chance to look this over, but any discussion on the request?</td>

Because if it&#39;s going to be another 2.5 million, then it has to be open for another procurement. And just so that people can come again and bid, because it&#39;s been three years. so given how fast technology system keep changing you know is it is the system that it provided still the most efficient in operation and cost effective three years later uh does the administration have any response to that any anything you want to indicate</td>

And he has been trying to retire since I believe the end of June. And we have been trying to replace him since that time. We now have a pretty robust group of candidates from which to draw from. But we were up against a wall for the September hearings because we did not have we weren&#39;t that far along in the process. And for the additional $500 a month subject to your approval and appropriation, he was willing to continue through the end of the year. So the end of the year being the end of December. And so we&#39;re looking for roughly 20, $6,200 and we have it in our budget. We just need to switch it from one personnel line to another so that we can pay the municipal hearing officer to continue to conduct the hearings through December, at which point we hope to have a new municipal hearing officer. And it is the intent as far as I understand that there is a movement by HR and I believe the clerk&#39;s office to shift the payment from a stipend type situation to more of an hourly type situation. But this is only to get us through the end of December.</td>

                <td> Good evening through the chair. So DPW is asking for the use of FY26 funds to cover three different vendor FY25 invoices for net metering accounts. Unfortunately, these invoices can be extremely difficult to forecast. as they are solar dependent. So three vendors, Sunwealth Power, Greenbacker, and Select Energy Leasy are the three vendors that we need funding for in FY26, as we fell short in FY25. Although we did carry forward the purchase orders we had on hand, the funding just wasn&#39;t sufficient enough to get us through the fiscal year. We also have an additional request for Verizon for the fleet tracking system for vehicles. We had an open purchase order that we carried forward in FY25 that was $2,124.13 short of being able to pay the final bill for fiscal year 25. So those are the four invoices or the four vendors that I&#39;m presenting to you. And we also have Superintendent Ben Waldrop, who can speak to the Always Green and the Stanley Tree invoices that we&#39;re asking for additional funding for in FY26.</td>

There was an issue where the contract expired and there was a small timeframe in which the expiration didn&#39;t quite meet the updated contract date. Therefore, we fell short $3,075 that were considered off-contract expenditures with that vendor. And then for Stanley Tree, we had completed all of the trimmings in Ward 1. And due to the enormous amount of trims needed in Ward 1, we exceeded the value of the Year 1 contract. And additional monies were needed to complete the trims in Ward 2, which were completed in Fiscal Year 25.</td>

That&#39;s where the fiscal year dealing becomes difficult with the grounds department because right when our peak season starts, the budgetary year ends and then restarts. So we had, uh, an ending contract at Lincoln park and then activating a new contract, hence the always green invoices. And then Stanley more or less of the same with that, where we had that $444,000 contract, um, executed in full, and then we had to close out some POs and then reopen them to start that work July 1st. So hence the spending differential there and these invoices that went unpaid, kind of being right in the grounds busy season.</td>

So for the most part, these funds are used typically for the supplies and the I guess, like the pamphlets and things that they provide for outreach. They do minimally use this grant for a little bit of OT. It doesn&#39;t go very far, you know, once you kind of break down this $10,000. But they kind of use it as a supplement. to their kind of the CITT grant and the jail diversion grant to do some of that additional work around behavioral health issues. They do provide a little bit of training with this to law enforcement officers that kind of goes out of the scope of CITT and kind of goes into the scope of overdose awareness. So I would say that it&#39;s pretty minimal in terms of OT and more used for programmatic expenses and the outreach. Like I said, the way that it&#39;s been described to me and how I&#39;ve noticed it being used in the budget is kind of as a supplement to the overall core strategies so that they kind of work together with their grants and their budget to kind of do the most that they can do.</td>

I could, if, if, if it would be something you&#39;d be interested in, I could inquire and see if there&#39;s any, I guess, potential, parallel or adjacent, you know, where, where the core program works with others outside of the police department, if that would be something you might be interested in.</td>

This allows us to bolster our 9-1-1 budget and take some of that off of the community and our operating costs. This portion of the grant in particular, as you mentioned, is training costs. That includes some of the OT required to allow 911 operators to attend the certification off of the clock. So it&#39;s over time. So that means that they have a chance to work on their certification and then allows them to continue to provide their services as 911 operators without being conflicted. So that&#39;s a great opportunity. Additionally, this also pays for the vendor costs for the 911 certification. So that also helps alleviate that off of our budget.</td>

That was about $256,000. So that&#39;s a great stat and we can quickly As you know, I sit on the job creation and retention trust. And so funds have been, you know, like drying up. I guess when I looked at this whole other table, because he explained his analysis was so spot on. And I&#39;m looking at most of the funds, the stabilization, cash balances, the EMA for various things. And one thing that even piqued my eye is the glx we&#39;re done with glx you know and i see like you know about four million dollars in that in that account and as you probably know we actually removed part of that money to actually you know fund the high school So I just was curious how we can move some of these funds around, like what is like, what would be like the process like, you know, even though they&#39;ve been earmarked, but some of the projects, they no longer exist. So what, how do we, you know, what is, is Director Bean here to begin with?</td>

Everything is so spot on, you know, even including like our bond rating, why we keep certain percentage, you know, of funds. Because we have like, I think we&#39;re probably the highest in the state, you know. I&#39;m sure other communities do their own differently, too. I&#39;ll be curious to know, like, you know, I could not even find anything for Boston, so they probably have their own system. But I was, I&#39;m not sure, like, I just wanted to know, you know, what the process would be like to, you know, like, increase that amount by looking at some of these funds that we got. He&#39;s clearly marked, like, the no activity one. That one was clear, it was easy, and he already acknowledged that we can repurpose those. But it would be good to know from him what some of these other earmark funds for projects that no longer exist, what is the plan for those. And the main thing is about just suggesting how we can have a broad policy conversation about what is needed, what is prudent, whether it will be able to make, you know, we&#39;ll be able to make like higher, higher withdrawals and repurposed funds in the next fiscal years. Like during budget season, you know, we can, if we run short of budget or grant funds for our priority services, like say housing stability, you know, immigrant assistance or afterschool program, like what is that, What would that process look like?

And wanted to also note that, as stated in his memo, there is a process undergoing in the finance department right now to look at those funds, so exactly as you have raised, Council Member Mbah, to figure out which ones can be repurposed. And there should be items coming before the council in the coming weeks. I think there are two items that will be before the council on Thursday regarding the creation of a few of new stabilization funds to track and define the purpose of what those are going to be used for. And I will note that all stabilization funds, appropriations from those funds have to be approved by the council. And I believe also repurposing those funds has to be approved by this council. And all stabilization funds have to have a designated purpose. So just wanted to note that those things are forthcoming. This conversation will be ongoing as the city does take steps to repurpose the dollars we have in the stabilization accounts. And that Director Bean will be before this committee to talk in detail about the items that will be before the council as of Thursday.</td>

                <td>Oh, that&#39;s the least you can do when someone sends you a 17-page report. And actually full of really good content as well. While we&#39;re seeing if Mr. Vladecki, I&#39;ll just say that the recommendations I thought that I pulled out of there How do we keep an inventory and make sure that we&#39;re standardizing every stabilization, reserve, and trust account to make sure that we&#39;re keeping track of the purpose of it, what its origin was, and if there&#39;s any legal obligation or any legal authority with that? How do we set target balances for each fund? I guess there&#39;s a percentage of the budget or a dollar cap, and then What do we do if we need to return or repurpose any excess funds? How are we reviewing accounts periodically, either once or once every other year, just to identify funds that have gone stagnant? When do we close or reallocate balances if we determine that an account is obsolete or if it&#39;s gone dormant? so that we can transfer those to a high priority area, infrastructure, schools, public services. And then how do we improve transparency by publishing just the full account details on it? We&#39;ve talked about this in the way of having possibly a tableau or something like we&#39;ve seen with the ARPA funds and tying those to back to any originating actions by the council. That was my view of the recommendation. That was my takeaway. If colleagues want to share theirs, unless Mr. Valletta has managed to become unmuted here. I don&#39;t think so. Colleagues, anything you want to add here? And Mr. Valletta, I&#39;m sorry, we&#39;re not able to hear directly from you tonight.</td>

                <td> Yeah, through you. I really appreciate this conversation. I really do look forward to sort of a detailed breakdown as to what the funds are specifically. You know, I see the Alpine restaurant stabilization, but more importantly, the Alpine street stabilization. I&#39;m just curious as to what project that was part of. Like I said, like I&#39;ve noted before, I thought there was a Lowell Street stabilization fund, and maybe we spent that one down and somehow took it off the list, but I could have swore that was the actual name of it, Lowell Street. So this thing kind of does remain a mystery to me as well, and I am curious, like you said, maybe it is that we just, by MGL, we have to give it back once we&#39;ve feel like it&#39;s been satisfied, you know, the stipulations from the ZBA or whatever body. And yeah, it&#39;s just, it&#39;s, I mean, some of these are just so mysterious. 15, you know, there&#39;s a lot of money in some of these and it&#39;d be interesting to see how we&#39;ve used it and, and so on. So yeah, you know, happy that this was brought up and looking forward to hopefully getting that on the website and just, you know, having more information in general. Because if there is a way we can recycle the money, obviously, you know, as times get tougher, we&#39;re looking, like you said, in the seat cushions, it&#39;d be really great to be able to figure out how to acquire, like access these funds for different purposes.</td>

All right, that brings us to the end of tonight&#39;s agenda. And tip of the cap to our legislative liaison for bringing us an answer here while we&#39;re still in the meeting. That is much appreciated. So we&#39;ve reached the end of tonight&#39;s agenda. Clerk, could we please take up the items on the table awaiting a vote on approval and take a batch vote on those, please, as well as Council Member Vaz&#39;s motion to adjourn. Take those up as one joint motion, please.</td>
