<li>
<p><strong>Status Update - Phase 1 Feasibility Analysis:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Review of Permitting Data:</strong><ul>
<li>Completed review of urban residential and mid-rise permitting data since 2019.</li>
<li>Analyzed approximately 20 urban residential projects and 25 mid-rise projects.</li>
<li>Data points included unit count, floor plate, building width, and lot coverage.</li>
<li><strong>Key Findings:</strong><ul>
<li>Urban residential buildings yielded an average of <strong>29 units</strong>.</li>
<li>Mid-rise 3 buildings yielded an average of <strong>14-15 units</strong>.</li>
<li>Mid-rise 4 buildings yielded an average of <strong>21 units</strong>.</li>
<li>Mid-rise 5 buildings showed a range of <strong>18 to 59 units</strong>, with significant variance between mixed-use and solely residential typologies.</li>
<li>Mid-rise 6 buildings yielded the highest average of <strong>81 units</strong>.</li>
<li>Denser projects (Mid-rise 4, 5, 6) require larger lot sizes:<ul>
<li>Mid-rise 4 and 5: Minimum building widths of <strong>48 feet to 117 feet</strong>.</li>
<li>Mid-rise 6: Larger lot sizes, around <strong>200 feet</strong> per project.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A fair amount of observed projects occurred on corner lots.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Assessor's Office Memo:</strong><ul>
<li>An attachment was provided with a status update.</li>
<li>The Assessor's Office is undergoing revaluations and will have more capacity for committee questions by late October/early November.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Fiscal Impact Analysis:</strong><ul>
<li>Currently in process.</li>
<li>Focusing on a scenario comparing fiscal impacts of neighborhood residential lots versus conversion to urban residential on those parcels.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Next Steps:</strong><ul>
<li>Begin Phase 2 of the analysis.</li>
<li>Targeting draft maps for discussion at the next meeting.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Committee Discussion and Questions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Councilor Wilson:</strong> Suggested considering school catchment areas and enrollment numbers in the analysis to account for potential impacts on K-8 schools, especially regarding family retention in Somerville.</li>
<li><strong>Chair (Councilor McLaughlin):</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Lot Depth and Upzoning:</strong> Recalled previous discussions regarding East Broadway upzoning, where shallow lots required adjacent properties for effective development. Asked if this remains the best policy and if "adjacency bonuses" (where an NR property next to an MR6 property could become MR6 if acquired by the same developer) could be explored.</li>
<li><strong>Samantha Carr's Response:</strong> Will research "adjacency bonuses" and peer comparators.</li>
<li><strong>Dan Bartman's Response:</strong><ul>
<li>Confirmed the importance of lot depth for efficient apartment building development (typically requiring 65-70 feet for a double-loaded corridor).</li>
<li>Acknowledged that shallow lots fronting main streets often necessitate including properties behind them for viable redevelopment.</li>
<li>Cited the Lindell's site in Ball Square as a real-world example where including adjacent lots facilitated redevelopment.</li>
<li>Stated that the Planning Department is actively asking these questions for potential upzoning in Gilman Square and the Broadway Corridor zoning study.</li>
<li>Expressed caution regarding "adjacency bonuses" due to Massachusetts legal constructs, where the City Council must retain control over zoning map changes. Will investigate further.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Outcome:</strong> The item remains in committee for further discussion and updates. The committee plans to continue meeting bi-weekly until a public hearing is warranted.</p>
</li>
</ul>
