<h3 id="2-discussion-of-proposed-fy2026-budget-cuts-and-funding-increases">2. Discussion of Proposed FY2026 Budget Cuts and Funding Increases</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong> Chair Wilson outlined the "Cut Night" procedure, allowing motions for budget cuts or increased funding, requesting line account and number for all motions, and emphasizing conciseness due to the Committee of the Whole format.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="21-motion-to-reduce-executive-administration-personal-services-chief-administrative-officer-salary">2.1. Motion to Reduce Executive Administration Personal Services (Chief Administrative Officer Salary)</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Motion:</strong> Councilor J.T. Scott moved to reduce the Executive Administration Personal Services line by <strong>$186,744</strong>, representing the salary for the Chief Administrative Officer.<ul>
<li><strong>Rationale (Councilor Scott):</strong> This position was previously voted against by the Council, and its necessity should be re-evaluated.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>IGA Director Singh:</strong> Highlighted that the position is codified in the city's pending charter, which the Council supported. Warned that a cut would significantly impact existing programs and initiatives.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor McLaughlin:</strong> Stated he would vote "No" on the cut, citing that previous concerns (lack of charter, unsettled union contracts, poor communication from IGA's office) have been addressed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Vote:</strong> Roll call vote on the motion.<ul>
<li>Councilor Mbah: Yes</li>
<li>Councilor Wilson: No</li>
<li>Councilor Ewen-Campen: No</li>
<li>Councilor Scott: Yes</li>
<li>Councilor McLaughlin: No (stated intention, vote recorded as "No" for the record)</li>
<li>Councilor Burnley: Aye (Yes)</li>
<li>Councilor Sait: No</li>
<li>Councilor Strezo: Yes</li>
<li>Councilor Clingan: Yes</li>
<li>Councilor Davis: Yes</li>
<li>Councilor President Pineda-Newfeld: No</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Decision:</strong> The motion <strong>passed</strong> with 6 votes in favor, 4 votes against, and 1 abstention.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="22-motion-to-reduce-police-department-salaries-six-vacant-patrol-positions">2.2. Motion to Reduce Police Department Salaries (Six Vacant Patrol Positions)</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Motion:</strong> Councilor J.T. Scott moved to reduce the Police Department Salaries line by <strong>$496,370.34</strong>, representing six vacant patrol positions.<ul>
<li><strong>Recusal:</strong> Councilor McLaughlin recused himself from this discussion and vote.</li>
<li><strong>Rationale (Councilor Scott):</strong> Based on the 2024 departmental staffing study (completed March 2024, presented November 2024), which recommended cuts to patrol staff. These are currently vacant positions, so no one would lose their job. The study suggested up to eight positions could be removed without impacting operations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Chief Benford (Somerville Police Department):</strong> Vigorously opposed the cut, advocating for maintaining current funding and staffing. Stated the study discussed reallocation, not reduction. Cited changing circumstances, community needs, and the department's response to various incidents (e.g., Colorado, Minnesota, Brookline, immigration impact, Iran/Israel conflict). Emphasized the need for staffing for community events (Haunt Fest, Porch Fest, fireworks) and to avoid forced holdovers for officers.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Ewen-Campen:</strong> Opposed the cut, noting the budget includes 88 patrol positions, a reduction from previous years. Stated the increase in funding is due to collective bargaining, which he supported.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Davis:</strong> Opposed the cut. Acknowledged the value of the staffing study's reallocation suggestions (e.g., moving sworn positions to civilian roles). Expressed gratitude for officers' work and the new Chief's efforts. Believes the current 88-position count is appropriate and wants to give the Chief time to implement efficiencies.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Clingan:</strong> Opposed the cut. Stated that current staffing is the "bare minimum" for a dense city of 86,000 people. Expressed concerns about potential crime and lack of police presence. Believes alternative response programs need separate funding, not cuts to existing police.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor President Pineda-Newfeld:</strong> Opposed the cut. Cited constituent requests for more community policing and traffic enforcement. Praised Chief Benford's leadership and partnership in the Davis Square Public Safety Working Group. Highlighted the difficulty of recruiting police officers and the negative impact of annual budget cut discussions on recruitment.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Mbah:</strong> Opposed the cut. Acknowledged the intention behind the cut but noted the police budget increase is due to collective bargaining. Stated constituents in public housing request resources, not necessarily more policing. Expressed hope for future reallocation of resources.</li>
<li><strong>Chair Wilson:</strong> Clarified that the police staffing operations report recommended 43 patrol officers performing the role of patrol officer (down from 46), but also recommended reallocating those three positions to non-patrol roles, not eliminating them. Stated the report does not support reducing overall numbers.</li>
<li><strong>Director Gill (Director of Human Resources):</strong> Reported that six conditional offers have been made to police officers, with three ready to start within a month and three entering the academy in October. This leaves only two technically open positions.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Sait:</strong> Opposed the cut. Expressed frustration with the administration's lack of progress on an alternative emergency response program but believes this cut would not help achieve that goal. Noted the funding increase was due to collective bargaining.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Scott (Second Round):</strong> Acknowledged the motion would not pass. Argued that the recommendations for staffing changes have been consistent for over 20 years, not a hasty change. Stated the cut would free up <strong>$500,000</strong> that could be allocated to an unarmed alternative emergency response, a stated Council priority. Noted hiring freezes in other departments (e.g., DPW) while the police department is not facing similar constraints.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Vote:</strong> Roll call vote on the motion.<ul>
<li>Councilor Mbah: Yes</li>
<li>Councilor Wilson: No</li>
<li>Councilor Ewen-Campen: No</li>
<li>Councilor Scott: Yes</li>
<li>Councilor McLaughlin: Recused</li>
<li>Councilor Burnley: No</li>
<li>Councilor Sait: No</li>
<li>Councilor Strezo: No</li>
<li>Councilor Clingan: No</li>
<li>Councilor Davis: No</li>
<li>Councilor President Pineda-Newfeld: No</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Decision:</strong> The motion <strong>failed</strong> with 2 votes in favor, 8 votes against, and 1 recusal.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="23-withdrawn-motion-to-reduce-police-department-personal-services-senior-officer-positions">2.3. Withdrawn Motion to Reduce Police Department Personal Services (Senior Officer Positions)</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Motion:</strong> Councilor J.T. Scott stated he had an additional motion to reduce senior officer positions (sergeant and lieutenant ranks) by approximately <strong>$680,000</strong>, based on staffing study recommendations for supervisory-to-patrol officer ratios.</li>
<li><strong>Action:</strong> Councilor Scott <strong>withdrew</strong> the motion due to lack of support indicated by the previous vote.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="24-motion-to-cut-public-safety-for-all-project-manager-position">2.4. Motion to Cut Public Safety for All Project Manager Position</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Motion:</strong> Councilor Willie Burnley moved to cut <strong>$90,000</strong> from the personnel line of the Executive Office Administration, specifically targeting the Public Safety for All Project Manager position.<ul>
<li><strong>Rationale (Councilor Burnley):</strong> This position was created to implement recommendations, but the administration's current approach is to "double down" on existing practices rather than building new alternative responses. Believes the <strong>$90,000</strong> could be better used elsewhere. Expressed frustration with the slow pace of change and the idea of waiting years for new hires to "figure it out."</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Councilor President Pineda-Newfeld:</strong> Opposed the cut. Reminded colleagues that the Public Safety for All report was the result of a 16-person task force, including Councilors and community members, and a comprehensive survey in seven languages. Argued it represents a broad community perspective.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Davis:</strong> Acknowledged the task force's work but stated he joined late and did not agree with many of the recommendations, particularly the focus on co-response rather than a "true alternative response." Expressed concern that the administration's vision for this position might not align with what he believes is most effective.</li>
<li><strong>Mike Mastroboni (Budget Director):</strong> Clarified that the Public Safety for All Manager position is <strong>not</strong> funded from the general fund for FY26. It was appropriated last June from the Racial and Social Justice Fund. Therefore, a cut to the general fund would not impact this specific position.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Scott:</strong> Supported the motion despite the funding clarification. Argued that while the position is grant-funded, the Council can use cuts to express policy desires. Noted that funds were authorized a year ago, but no one has been hired, and no progress has been made on stated goals. Believes this cut would send a clear message to the administration to change its approach.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Vote:</strong> Roll call vote on the motion.<ul>
<li>Councilor Mbah: Yes</li>

<li>Councilor Strezo: No</li>
<li>Councilor Clingan: No</li>
<li>Councilor Davis: No</li>
<li>Councilor President Pineda-Newfeld: No</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Decision:</strong> The motion <strong>failed</strong> with 2 votes in favor and 9 votes against.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-end-of-year-appropriation-items-agenda-items-4-14">3. End-of-Year Appropriation Items (Agenda Items 4-14)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Action:</strong> Chair Wilson waived the readings of agenda items 4-14.</li>
<li><strong>Action:</strong> Administration requested to withdraw ID number <strong>25-1027</strong> and ID number <strong>25-1030</strong> due to resubmission with corrections.</li>
<li><strong>Decision:</strong> The Clerk marked ID number <strong>25-1027</strong> and ID number <strong>25-1030</strong> as withdrawn.</li>
<li><strong>Decision:</strong> The remaining items (agenda items 4, 6, and 8-14) will be discharged without a recommendation and taken up as part of the vote on the FY26 budget as a whole at the regular meeting on Thursday.</li>
<li><strong>Note:</strong> Other end-of-year appropriation, transfer, repurposing, and expenditure limit items tabled two weeks prior (listed as agenda items 5-2 to 5-23 on the Thursday night agenda) will also be taken up on Thursday.</li>
