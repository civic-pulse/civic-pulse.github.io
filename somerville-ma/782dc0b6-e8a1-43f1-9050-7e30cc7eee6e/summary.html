<ul>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> Resolution condemning Harvard University's attempt to strip union protections from graduate student workers.</li>
<li><strong>Motion:</strong> Councillor Burnley moved to replace the item with a revised version.</li>
<li><strong>Revised Resolution Language (read by Clerk):</strong> "Whereas education, research, and academic inquiry are values intimately connected to the lives, careers, and passions of Somervillians, and whereas the Trump administration has targeted education and research, including grants, funding, and academic freedom at Harvard University, and whereas Harvard University employs many residents of Somerville, and whereas labor unions play a critical role in workplace and economic justice, and whereas Harvard University is attempting to strip union protections away from workers who are in tenuous positions in science research, including by removing hundreds of students from the Harvard Graduate Student Union, now therefore be it resolved that the Somerville City Council strongly opposes these actions by Harvard, is opposed to all forms of union busting, and urges Harvard administrators to undo these actions, and be it further resolved that Somerville urges Harvard administration to seriously engage with the demands of the Harvard Graduate Students Union on issues from fair pay to protections from harassment and discrimination to resources for non-citizens, and be it further resolved that a copy of this resolution be transmitted to Harvard University administration and president."</li>
<li><strong>Outcome of Motion to Replace:</strong> Approved.</li>
<li><strong>Discussion on Revised Resolution:</strong><ul>
<li>Councillor Burnley spoke about the "disturbing and frankly disgusting actions" by Harvard, attempting to remove 973 workers from their union, arguing they are not workers. He called this an attack on the dignity of all workers and an attempt to bankrupt the union.</li>
<li><strong>Public Comment:</strong> Dorothy Manovich (Somerville resident, Harvard Graduate Students Union member) spoke about the benefits of her union membership (dental surgery, protection from overwork/harassment) and the impact of Harvard's actions on 1,000 workers who would lose wage protections, harassment protections, and access to emergency funds. She stated the actions are "pretty explicitly illegal" and weaken the union's capacity.</li>
<li>Co-sponsors: Councillors Wilson, McLaughlin, Scott, Strezo, Mbah.</li>
<li>Councillor Mbah thanked Councillor Burnley and Ms. Manovich, sharing his own experience as a union member in grad school.</li>
<li>Councillor Wilson condemned Harvard for taking advantage of the rollback of labor gains under the Trump administration, calling it "disgusting" and an exploitation of student labor.</li>
<li>Councillor Scott urged Harvard to de-escalate the conflict, stating graduate students and workers are not the enemy and make the institution flourish.</li>
<li>Councillor Strezo expressed solidarity with the workers.</li>
<li>Councillor Davis echoed support, emphasizing the fundamental right to withhold labor and the importance of collaboration on labor issues.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Outcome:</strong> Approved.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Item 10.3: Resolution by Councillor Burnley (Public Workers' Right to Strike)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> Resolution in support of a pair of bills at the State House that would give certain public workers the right to strike.</li>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li>Councillor Burnley argued that withholding labor is a fundamental right for workers and citizens, and public workers should have the same rights as private sector workers to pursue better working conditions, wages, and dignity. He noted that Somerville's voice matters at the state level.</li>
<li><strong>Public Comment:</strong><ul>
<li>Colette Burrard (Ward 7 resident, public school teacher) shared her experience with the Andover Education Association strike in November 2023, highlighting the risks and the lack of incentive for school committees to negotiate when strikes are illegal. She argued that making strikes illegal doesn't stop them, but rather incentivizes employers to wait out workers.</li>
<li>Jim Kaplan (Ward 6 resident, former Somerville teacher, Mass Teachers Association) discussed the historical division between private and public sector labor rights, noting its origins in excluding certain groups. He argued that increasing labor power is crucial for the Democratic Party and that the right to strike would lead to earlier contract settlements and prevent loss of workers.</li>
<li>Mary Ann Wallace (Ward 4 resident, Regional Vice President for SEIU 509) spoke about public sector workers being "held at gunpoint" due to their inability to strike, leading to stalled negotiations and delayed payments. She emphasized that contracts are about working conditions and fighting for community members, not just wages.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Co-sponsors: Councillors Wilson, Davis, Scott, Mbah, McLaughlin, Strezo.</li>
<li>Councillor McLaughlin discussed the historical struggle for labor rights, noting that strikes are a significant risk for workers and not taken lightly. He supported the right to strike as a means to ensure fair pay for vital work.</li>
<li>Councillor Wilson referenced the UK's approach to public sector strikes, suggesting that providing good contracts to unions prevents strikes.</li>
<li>Councillor Scott highlighted that public sector workers often take lower pay due to their belief in public service and that the right to strike empowers them in decision-making processes, leading to a better system.</li>
<li>Councillor Mbah thanked the speakers and Councillor Burnley for their leadership.</li>
<li>Councillor Davis emphasized that this resolution is an expression of support to state representatives for a fundamental issue affecting millions of workers, and that the October 1st effective date for the condominium conversion ordinance would not change regardless of the timing of the vote.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Outcome:</strong> Approved.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Item 10.4: Communication by Councillor Burnley (Wage Theft Advisory Committee)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> Conveying information regarding the reconstitution of the Wage Theft Advisory Committee.</li>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong> Councillor Burnley informed the Council that he would be working with the Council President to find representatives from various unions to fill positions on the committee, which currently lacks a quorum. He expects to present suggestions after the recess to ensure the committee can effectively address wage theft.</li>
<li><strong>Outcome:</strong> Approved.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>9. Committee Reports</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Item 6C: Report of the Committee on Legislative Matters (Meeting on July 1st, 2025)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Presenter:</strong> Councillor Davis.</li>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li>The committee discussed regulation of mopeds/motorized bicycles, focusing on insurance and making the community path safer. The item was left in committee for further research.</li>
<li>The primary discussion was on proposed amendments to the condominium conversion ordinance (Item 24-1740, later identified as 25-1044).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Motion:</strong> Councillor Davis moved to sever Item 25-1044 with the intent to place it on file, as it would be replaced by Item 7.1.</li>
<li><strong>Outcome of Motion to Sever:</strong> Approved.</li>

<li><strong>Outcome of Report:</strong> Accepted as submitted.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Item 7.1: Request of the Mayor (Amendment to Condominium Conversion Ordinance)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> Requesting ordainment of an amendment to sections 7-64, 7-65, and 7-68 of the Code of Ordinances to reduce displacement of tenants and update relocation payments. This item replaces the one previously discussed in committee.</li>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li>Councillor Davis clarified that this item is substantively the same as the one discussed in committee, with the addition of an October 1st effective date. The changes aim to mitigate tenant displacement by making it more attractive to keep residents in their homes.</li>
<li>Councillor Scott (member of the working group) explained that the amendment addresses a loophole where tenants were displaced before receiving relocation benefits. The changes ensure that tenants receive compensation as intended by the ordinance.</li>
<li>Councillor Wilson moved to table Item 7.1, along with public communications 9.8, 10.18, 10.19, and 10.20, until the next meeting to allow more time for public feedback and for all councillors to be present for the discussion and vote.</li>
<li>Councillor Davis supported the motion to table, noting that the October 1st effective date would not change regardless of when the vote occurs, allowing for further consideration of constituent concerns.</li>
