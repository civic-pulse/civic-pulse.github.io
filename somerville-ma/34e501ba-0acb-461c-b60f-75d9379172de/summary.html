<h3 id="5-board-administration-item-draw-seven-park-bridge">5. Board Administration Item: Draw Seven Park Bridge</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Background (Steve Carey):</strong><ul>
<li>This item relates to a Chapter 91 application for the Draw Seven Park Bridge.</li>
<li>The Planning Board has the opportunity to submit a written recommendation.</li>
<li>There is confusion regarding the start date of the 45-day review period, as materials were not received by the Planning Division until late August due to City Hall AC issues.</li>
<li>The Law Department is being consulted on the exact start of the clock.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Board Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Michael Capuano:</strong> Expressed uncertainty about the Board's role in making recommendations on bridge sufficiency, noting that a "nice bridge" is generally desired.</li>
<li><strong>Lynn Richards:</strong> Emphasized the importance of the bridge's design and its connection to the Somerville side, comparing it to the Board's review of building aesthetics. Stated, "I do feel that we should look at the design in the same way that we look at the design of all the buildings and the developments that that we assess." Expressed disappointment that more design information was not provided, particularly regarding how the bridge grounds into Somerville, lighting, seating, and potential "bump outs."</li>
<li><strong>Michael McNeely:</strong> Referenced 310 CMR 9.13 subsection 5, which outlines the Board's ability to weigh in on public rights in tidelands and great ponds, and whether a project serves a proper public purpose. Expressed a desire to support the pedestrian and biking connection but felt insufficient materials were provided for a full assessment.</li>
<li><strong>Amelia Aboff:</strong> Suggested focusing on the "functionality of the connectivity" rather than just aesthetics. Proposed referencing "Somerville Vision" principles in a letter to DCR to articulate community priorities, even in the absence of detailed design information.</li>
<li><strong>Steve Carey:</strong> Clarified that the 45-day period includes 30 days for a public hearing and 15 additional days for a recommendation. Suggested a motion to acknowledge receipt and request additional materials.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Motion:</strong> Michael Capuano moved to acknowledge receipt of the materials for the Draw Seven Park Bridge project and request additional materials, specifically conceptual design information regarding how the bridge connects to the park, lighting, seating, and potential "bump outs," to inform a timely recommendation by the October 2nd meeting. The motion also included a request for the Solicitor's Office to provide an opinion on the timeline for the 45-day review period.</li>
<li><strong>Second:</strong> Amelia Aboff</li>
<li><strong>Vote:</strong><ul>
<li>Jahan Habib: Aye</li>
<li>Lynn Richards: Aye</li>
<li>Luc Schuster: Aye</li>
<li>Michael McNeely: Aye</li>
<li>Amelia Aboff: Aye</li>
<li>Michael Capuano: Aye</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Outcome:</strong> The motion passed unanimously (6-0).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="6-board-administration-item-central-broadway-corridor-zoning-study">6. Board Administration Item: Central Broadway Corridor Zoning Study</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Information (Steve Carey):</strong><ul>
<li>A zoning study of the Central Broadway Corridor (between Ball Square and Magoun Square) was completed.</li>
<li>An initial public presentation in March was poorly attended due to a conflicting event.</li>
<li>A second public meeting is scheduled for Tuesday, September 24, 2025, to present the study findings.</li>
<li>The study was initiated by a state grant to harmonize zoning between Somerville and Medford along the shared border.</li>
<li>The study is informational and intended to inform future planning initiatives, not for adoption by the Planning Board.</li>
<li>Medford's Planning Director has been invited to attend to discuss their progress on zoning.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Board Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Amelia Aboff:</strong> Inquired if the Board would have a discussion about the study materials at an upcoming meeting, assuming it might lead to a plan for approval.</li>
<li><strong>Jahan Habib:</strong> Thanked Steve Carey for sharing the information and suggested that such relevant studies and community engagement events be shared with the Board as part of "other board matters" for awareness.</li>
<li><strong>Steve Carey:</strong> Confirmed he would continue to use the board administration item to share information on ongoing studies and community engagement events.</li>
</ul>
</li>
