And it&#39;s created this sort of permanent headache for quite a while. um so that was sort of the impetus was i think a grant that was um from the state um that was for both cities to kind of look together to work together to try to figure out if there&#39;s a way to harmonize zoning um between the two sides look at medford&#39;s look at somerville&#39;s um and we sort of use that as an opportunity to um hold back this was back in 2024 now but hold some public engagement events to really really try to get a handle on what level of density people were comfortable with along that stretch and sort of what you know land uses might be desired or might be missing um so so yeah so the resulting document is what we refer to as a study it&#39;s sort of information for the public and to inform future planning initiatives um not a not a plan to be adopted um by the planning board um that being said i mean it you know it&#39;s</td>

Joseph Baeta, Supt of Schools &amp; You know, is. that that waterway is in does have the opportunity to submit a written recommendation. The form that I had forwarded around as part of the packet is really just a form to basically acknowledge that the planning board did receive those materials. There was some confusion over when our division received those materials. So they had apparently mailed it to our office over the summer. We&#39;ve had AC issues in City Hall all summer. We haven&#39;t been in that often. We hadn&#39;t received those materials. Obviously, we would have forwarded along to you guys as soon as we had, but we didn&#39;t receive them for whatever reason. So we didn&#39;t become aware of that Chapter 91 application until I think it was late August. So that&#39;s when we got it on the September 4 agenda. so there is some um i think still not clarity on on when the uh clock has started for a review period because that would start when the planning board receives those materials um and i&#39;m i&#39;m i basically asked the A lot of department for their input on it. Their take was that it could be kind of a tricky question, but really what it comes down to is if a written recommendation is something that the planning board wants to submit in accordance with code of Massachusetts regulations, that&#39;s something that can be submitted and we can get a sort of legal opinion on when that 40 to five day period would begin. my understanding uh would be that it would start when we actually sign that form acknowledging receipt of the materials that would make sense to me but we don&#39;t have a clear answer on that yet but i guess i would just leave it at it&#39;s really it&#39;s at the board&#39;s discretion to decide if you if you do want to submit a reckon recommendation relative to that pedestrian bridge okay um thank you i mean i love i love having an answer we don&#39;t really have the answer that i think</td>

The same can be said for a bridge. So I really appreciated uh steve&#39;s research on 91 i also did a little bit of research as well on it and i do think that we have the the the wherewithal like we have the authority if we wanted to talk a little bit about the design There was one piece that I found kind of frustrating is that the first guy from Tetra Tech saying I&#39;ve been working on this for eight years and we&#39;re at 20 percent design. Now, in my world, in urban design, when an engineer says 20 percent design, that is 20 percent design with cost elements. But they have it all sketched out of what they want it to be. And now they&#39;re going through the very fine kind of blueprint. So I was a little disappointed that we didn&#39;t get more information on what the bridge was going to look like as it grounds into Somerville. I mean, I understand your position, Michael. and pedestrian bridge, good, but we want to have a beautiful pedestrian bridge. This is a once in a, this is a unique opportunity for Somerville and for this bridge and shouldn&#39;t we, are we the only local voice here that will, I mean, yes, there&#39;s public comment and as citizens we can certainly engage, but you know, as an institution, we might be able to influence is like, let&#39;s have a beautiful bridge, just not a nice bridge, but a beautiful bridge. So that&#39;s, that&#39;s what I&#39;ve been thinking about. This isn&#39;t a hill I&#39;m going to die on. But I do feel that we should look at the design in the same way that we look at the design of all the buildings and the developments that that we assess. Thank you.</td>

So I also would like to echo a couple of thoughts that Lynn had in there as well and highlight that Stephen was kind enough to point us to a little bit of language also in the 3.10 CMR, I believe specifically section 9.13 subsection 5. And I&#39;m sure my colleagues have also probably looked at this because we&#39;re all code nerds. In there, it does talk a little bit about our just general acknowledgement of materials. And I think, Mr. Chair, you&#39;ve already kind of set a certain tone that that might be the best thing for us to do. And I wouldn&#39;t be opposed to that specifically because it does highlight two other things that we could be weighing in on specifically if we were to write a letter of recommendation. And they were one, uh whether or not this would be detrimental to public rights in thailand&#39;s and great ponds and i know i as one board member did not see sufficient materials to help me feel one way or the other on that and at the end of the day i probably would hope that the city would be able to provide some resources to help us make that assessment the second one looks a little bit more like it&#39;s in our standard purview somewhere where i&#39;d feel a little more comfortable uh waiting in for lack of intention on pun there. And it specifically says, serves a proper public purpose, except in the case of water dependent use projects entirely on private tidelands, right. And so that&#39;s where we get into this use as a pedestrian and biking. And you know, I, as one member and as one member of the public here, Um, I have very much hope to see that particular connection improve as a pedestrian user. Like it is not always great to cross that waterway with the options that we have available today. So I know I would love the opportunity to. be able to put our weight and support behind this. But I think to member Richard&#39;s point, I think we need a little bit more material to do that. And if we don&#39;t feel like we have sufficient time to do that and the applicant doesn&#39;t desire our support and input, then perhaps we just fall back to acknowledging receipt. But I know as one member, I would love to have the opportunity to put some weight behind it.</td>

So, you know, whether I don&#39;t think we&#39;re going to talk DCR into choosing a better aesthetic design personally, but I think we might be able to choose to nudge them into some kind of more optimal, you know, actual connectivity. I&#39;m not sure, but that&#39;s my baseline assumption about sort of where the parameters of DCR&#39;s flexibility will lie.

What&#39;s the seating? People are going to be fishing off the bridge. Are there going to be little bump outs along the bridge? So again, to understand more of the conceptual design of it so we can better assess that the bridge is meeting the goals of connectivity and vibrancy a la Amelia&#39;s comments.</td>
