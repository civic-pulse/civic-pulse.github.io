The first seven items are likely to go fairly quickly here. So with that, let&#39;s dive in and we&#39;re gonna take up those six minutes items, agenda items one through six. Together, those are the minutes from this committee&#39;s meetings during last month&#39;s budget season. Wave the readings of those. On those minutes, any discussion? All right. Those items are laid on the table to recommend approval with a single vote at the end of tonight&#39;s meeting. And that&#39;s going to bring us to agenda item seven, ID number 25-0848. The mayor requests an approval to accept and expend a $38,500 grant with no new match required from the Boston Office of Emergency Management to the Police Department for the special response team equipment. The administration has indicated they have an update for us on this item, so I&#39;ll recognize legislative liaison Kimberly Hutter.</td>

I&#39;ve been looking for that document online, and I&#39;ll admit I have not been able to find it anywhere.

So I am off camera and my sincere apologies, although I have tried. Through the chair, I&#39;d like to thank the members here this evening, as well as the IGA and the mayor&#39;s staff and city staff with regards to this proposal. This is a dynamite program that provides an opportunity for us to dispose of bikes that have been held by SPD largely as found property for a number of years through an equitable program that really helps us when we talk about our commitment to alternative modes of transportation in the city. It allows us to work with a local nonprofit partner to distribute and repair a number of different bicycles that we have in our possession that would otherwise ultimately find its way uh through the disposition process um and possibly uh destruction um over time um through the support of the court this allows us to work uh with our partners uh in mobility and law and city partners to distribute these bikes uh across the city in an equitable way uh we looked at a number of different uh local partners uh to include uh some of the bike kitchen uh bikes not bombs who&#39;s not um situated in Somerville, but does have some services that they provide in Somerville. We looked at Groundwork Somerville, and we looked at Bike to See, and regrettably, because of the large volume of bicycles that we have, none of them had the capacity to take the bikes on and work with us and distribute the bicycles to our community members through an equitable fashion. They just didn&#39;t have the capacity, although they had the spirit and the heart to want to do it. Through a spirited recommendation from one of our captains at the police department, they recommended the YMCA as a partner in this space. And the YMCA stepped up, has the capacity, and has agreed to work with us to distribute these bikes. At this juncture, we have approximately 78 bikes that we&#39;re looking to distribute through this iteration. They have offered up a program that looks at some program goals that talk about program to promote sustainable transportation and can enhance community health and wellbeing. advance equity and access, foster positive community relations, and promote bicycle safety and education. I would like to mention that when we talk about the bicycles, they&#39;ve been in our possession for some time. Many of them are in very good shape, but others require some tuning up and some refreshing to ensure that they&#39;re roadworthy and safe for our community to use. So I enthusiastically again promote this program and present it to this committee and ask for approval and support to move this forward. We think that this is a win-win for our community, for our ideals around alternative transportation, as well as being able to provide a vital resource for some community members who may otherwise be economically disadvantaged and may not be able to enjoy this asset and this opportunity.</td>

I know this is something Councilor Ewen-Campen and Councilor Clingan, I believe, put in an item back in 2021 about this. Hey, next best time, the present. Question was, I think Cambridge Bike Give Back, if I recall, did an event in the city maybe a couple of years ago. Were they looked at at all as an option here? Did anyone talk to them also?</td>

I can&#39;t say that I would call them... being considered, we really did put a focus on local in-city opportunities and organizations initially. We would have certainly taken a look at them as we did look broad and wide, but we just didn&#39;t know about it. But we did not, to my knowledge, take a look. And IGA, as well as mobility, did help in that space. I&#39;m not sure if anyone from IGA may be able to offer up any thoughts on it. But initially, in our memo, It did cite the organizations that we did look at and that one doesn&#39;t initially jump out.</td>

I had conversations with some folks in leadership there and we gave away 75 bikes, I believe it was. which is about this total, actually, ironically. And I&#39;m only able to cite that number because I have a post from a little over two years ago about this. Now, given that the Y is its own sort of organization and there are, I believe, memberships for the Y, my natural question would be, Would the folks eligible to receive these bikes have to be members of the Y? Would it be available to the wider community? That&#39;s for the chief or IGA, anyone who can answer.</td>

We wanted to make sure as best we could that this opportunity is being made available to the community without having to have an affiliation with any one organization, right? It&#39;s about the in-kind gesture. So they do not have to be members of the Y in order to benefit from this program.</td>

Glad to hear that this could be more widely available.

And I just wanted to potentially add another clarifying point. I want to be clear that when we&#39;re talking about amending existing internal policies, it&#39;s actually, while bicycles fit within this parameter, it actually applies to all surplus municipal property. So these bicycles, because they had been on claim for a period of time, because there had actually been some notice on them, leaving, I guess the general answer to your question, counselor, And maybe just as some background, it might be helpful. I&#39;m a little bit fuzzy on the exact date. It&#39;s at least, you know, three to six months or so ago, probably more like six months or so ago, the city posted a notice with all of these, with all the vacant bicycles, including a description and a serial number. I believe most of these were tagged with an incident number as to how they came into the custody of the police department. But the city posted a notice and advised that anybody in the world who might have abandoned a bicycle or thought that they&#39;ve left a bicycle in Somerville to make any claims on these bicycles by a certain date or that... In the alternative, should they not do that, the city would deem them to be abandoned property, and we would take methods to dispose of them, including claiming them as our surplus property and then disposing them to a charity. There is a notice kind of outlining what the steps that the city intended to take was. And, you know, it was, my recollection is posted on the city website, and I believe through local newspapers as well. But I will, that&#39;s my recollection.</td>

So the biggest concern that we had was obviously that these bikes have been in our possession for some time, and we wanted to ensure that they were safe. So the biggest piece of the criteria was really around, obviously, because they were bikes, we focused on those types of organizations, whether they, you know, initially we looked at businesses, but obviously we were trying to partner with a nonprofit. for a smoother and an easier pathway. But we looked at the capacity. So we&#39;re talking 78 bikes, which is just an enormous amount of volume. And in talking with most of the vendors and partners, they just didn&#39;t have the capacity to be able to intake the bikes. And then the second piece, which was a big piece of the criteria was they had to agree to repair the bikes. The city was not in a position to pledge resources and funds to purchase material or goods or services to be able to do that. So part of the partnership, we were looking for a pledge to not only take the bikes on, repair the bikes, but also assist with distribution. So that was really the large high level criteria Again, we looked at the ones that were obvious to us. We did a little bit of homework. Regrettably, we didn&#39;t bump into Cambridge by give back, but we&#39;ll learn from that and certainly incorporate them into the future. But those are really the big broad areas was one, the capacity to take them on, B, the ability and willingness to partner with us to repair them. And then thirdly, an equitable distribution process.</td>

Just to name one, there&#39;s no Blue Bike station in the Mystics. And that&#39;s a huge population. I know Blue Bikes get used a lot there. The closest station to them is considerably far. So I&#39;d be curious. How that works on this might be one for director Ross and I realize of mobility, but you know just naming that I&#39;d love to see love to see us be able to get some stations into places that say they&#39;re currently underserved in the blue bikes network.</td>

                <td> Thank you, Chair. So just to introduce myself, my name is Ben Demers. I&#39;m a senior planner, real estate specialist with the Economic Development Division of OSPCD. I use he, him. So through you, Mr. Chair, to the committee, this item is to request approval of the final Urban Center Housing Tax Increment Financing, or UCTIF, agreement for the 299 Broadway project. Just to give a little bit of context, the UCTIF program, which is managed by the state&#39;s Executive Office of Housing and Livable Communities, or HLC, is authorizes municipalities to provide a real estate tax exemption on all or a portion of the increased value of improved real estate, i.e. the increment on the value, over a period of up to 20 years. And the goal of this program is really to support new housing and commercial development, especially affordable housing. So back in 2023, the City Council had conditionally agreed to provide a full 100% exemption on the increment for a full 20-year period for the 299 Broadway project. As a reminder, this redevelopment of a long vacant star market adjacent building and parking lot in Winter Hill will create 319 new units of housing, 136 of which are deed-restricted affordable, along with new retail space, two new public civic spaces, and a community room. And the intention stated at that time was to return to the City Council for final approval once the project was closer to receiving its building permits, which the team is working to do over the next month for an anticipated financial closing this September. The goal was to make sure that the full octave amount was still needed when the project was further along in its planning process. So economic development has worked with an independent real estate consultant, Abramson &amp; Associates, who also subcontracts with a consultant focused specifically on the affordable housing portion of the deal to review updated project financials and have determined that the full amount of the exemption is still needed to achieve a reasonable return on the investment. We&#39;re therefore looking to lock in this exemption percentage and period in an updated UCTF agreement. This agreement would also capture some changes that have been made to the project since 2023, including an increase in the unit count, all of which have been approved by the Somerville Zoning Board of Appeals, the ZBA. If recommended positively and approved by the full council, the updated agreement would then be signed by the mayor and would be sent to HLC and recorded with the Middlesex South Registry of Deeds. So thank you all for listening to the background context. I&#39;m here as well as Attorney Selkert, as you mentioned, to answer any questions that you might have. I&#39;ll also note that we have several representatives from the 299 Broadway Development Partnership here with us this evening as attendees. So if you do have any questions directly for the team, we can also promote them.</td>

I&#39;ll just say quickly, basically the pro forma, the financials that the developer provides show that construction costs haven&#39;t gone down and or projected future rental revenues haven&#39;t gone up such that they&#39;re gonna need the full UCH TIF to make the project pencil out. And we&#39;re just updating the agreement to reflect the final project numbers, right? Exactly. That was a scenario I remember I&#39;d asked about that back in 2023. So I just appreciate the thorough examination, the due diligence here to determine that they are going to need the full benefit of that tax increment financing. So thank you to you and everyone there for working on this. Good to see this project moving ahead and hopefully get into a groundbreaking in September. Councilor Burnley.</td>

I want to make sure we&#39;re still on track for that because it&#39;s a major project as far as my perspective from the city side. The most generous, you know, supports that the city can offer with this kind of an uptiff wouldn&#39;t want to do something to that effect if it&#39;s going to be a long drawn out process. Just to get a sense of this uptiff a little bit more within section six of the amended and restated agreement on point six of section six is this Is this amount, the $4.3 million, the amount that we are foregoing through the UCTF, or is this the whole worth currently and the amount that would be generated through the improvement of the parcel is a different number? That could be for anyone who can answer. Probably.</td>

It&#39;s the increment as the project is developed that will not be included. That&#39;s what gets deferred for 20 years. So they know the taxes that they&#39;ll be required to pay are fixed.

Uh, so want to be quite mindful of, uh, what&#39;s happening in terms of this arrangement. That and getting this done as quickly as possible are my main concerns here.

                <td>Yes, so through you, Mr. Chair, there is a definite distinction between TIF and DIF. In the rest of the country, TIF and DIF are more or less similar. But in Massachusetts, DIF is District Increment Financing and TIFF is Tax Increment Financing. The UCTF, which is the preferred method of pronunciation that the state uses, is the Urban Center Housing Tax and Current Financing Program. It is a very specific program run out of, I think, which now is HLC, the Housing and Livable Communities. And UCTF is a specific program for adding housing for supporting projects that add housing to commercial areas. This is the only site in Santa Barbara that we currently have an UCTIF plan approved. The UCTIF plan covers the properties that we have for the urban renewal plan in Winter Hill. We&#39;ve, um, It&#39;s now been several months since Tom and Mike Filoni and I were with you all to talk about the broad range of tools that we could be using to support further housing production in Somerville. We are planning to do that again, but this one is very specifically only right now applied in Winter Hill. District increment financing we have used in a few different cases. And that we&#39;ve looked at, we&#39;ve used in assembly. Alan is the expert, Alan Anasio, our finance director for OSPCD. He is our expert on all things tools that we&#39;ve used at Clarendon Hill, if you have more specifics on that project.</td>

That&#39;s ID number 25-1163. The mayor requests your approval of a public access and maintenance access easement for 299 Broadway property owner, LLC. And ID number 25-1164, the mayor requesting approval of a maintenance, access, easement, and landscape management and maintenance plan for 299 Broadway property owner LLC for the future Sewell Park at the 299 Broadway development facility. One programming note, there is a replacement item for 1164 that&#39;s on the agenda for Thursday night. We&#39;re going to go ahead and discuss this. And as we&#39;ve done a number of times, then there will be that replacement item that will be taken up on Thursday night when we do this committee report. I see we have same crew there.

                <td>I think I&#39;m up, Mr. Chair, unless someone tells me otherwise. Kathy Lester Salkert again. The best way to distinguish between these two agreements, they&#39;re going by their names. So Broadway Property Owner LLC, that is the Broadway Pocket Park. And there&#39;s a few unique things about these two easements. One is that we&#39;re doing these far in advance to add predictability for the financers that will be participating in the financial closing in September. They wanted to have all of the documents that will pertain to this development to be executed and on record as of the financial closing. the broadway pocket park will be at one end and the sewell park civic space will be at the other end and they&#39;re connected by something called the pedestrian muse and the there&#39;s a single landscape maintenance and management plan that covers sewell park the mute the pedestrian muse and broadway pocket park that will be incorporated in the easement for the Broadway Pocket Park, and then Sewell Park, in order to facilitate using a Mass Works grant, that money is being made to purchase that property ahead of time, and it&#39;s going to be held by the SRA. And once it&#39;s developed, it will be conveyed by the SRA to the city. And that is the explanation for the substitute item, because the way this was put in on the agenda, it says we&#39;re creating an access easement and also mentioned a covenant. I&#39;ll get to that in a moment. The easement will already be on record. There&#39;s a separate easement executed with the SRA that grants access to different areas. It&#39;s referenced in the Sewell Park Maintenance Agreement. It&#39;ll still stay there, and it shows you that the easement will already be on record as of that time. same thing for the covenant the covenant is the agreement that will run with the land that requires that the civic space or that it be maintained as a public park civic space type in perpetuity so we&#39;re kind of doing things in a little bit of a different order than we typically do and i hope that at least gives you a flavor of what&#39;s going on with these two documents</td>

Basically, the property owner is granting 24-7 public access to the Muse and the Temple Street Passageway and 8 a.m. to sunset access to the Broadway Park and Plaza. I have a feeling Counselor Scott might be about to ask about that. The property owner is responsible for maintenance and repairs of civic space and pedestrian access areas. Any changes to the civic space would need to be approved by the city, and Sewell Park is being transferred in perpetuity to the city, but 290 on Broadway, property owner LLC, is going to be responsible for maintenance and repairs of the park, including snow and trash removal and landscaping. Is that a fair summary? Correct, yes.</td>

                <td>Thank you, Mr. Chair. You know how much I love to closely read easement agreements. I actually appreciated your catch on that. But the, The question I had was actually in some of the depth of these documents. For members of the public, these are incredible documents. If you&#39;re curious as to how much work goes into crafting these agreements and really how much thought goes into the design of our public spaces, these are 47-page documents and there&#39;s a lot of specificity in terms of types of play structures and types of surfaces and thought around accessible pathways. If you&#39;re curious as to what our PSUP department does, this is a great way to get an inside look on that. That said, one thing, while it&#39;s very detailed in terms of plant species, integrated pest management plans, I mean, it goes deep. The one thing that I didn&#39;t see that was just mildly concerning to me, but Maybe we&#39;ve already handled it through a different mechanism. When referring to furnishings, it talks about some movable furnishings being brought inside seasonally and the inspection requirements for fixed furniture. But I didn&#39;t see any requirements in the fixed furnishings. They not be what&#39;s termed hostile architecture, right? Anti- sometimes called anti-homeless architecture. And I was curious if, I know there&#39;s been several attempts by the city council to prevent the city from installing or using any such. Is that covered already in this agreement? Or is this, I&#39;m hoping my concern is unfounded, I guess, Attorney Seliger. Maybe I can help you.</td>

And I know they are very eagerly looking to start the work to close on things and start the work on this in September. Is it, I&#39;ll ask, is it possible to get something like this, a relatively small change like that negotiated and changed by Thursday? I know we have members of Mark Development here in the audience. I know it&#39;s a little unorthodox here, but I wanna see this get approved on Thursday night, but I also wanna see some of these concerns addressed about the hostile architecture and about the hours. Yeah, senior planner Demers.</td>

I believe Councilor Scott amongst other folks may have been referring to an effort I was pushing on my first year on the council to put forward an ordinance to ban hostile architecture in Somerville. At the time I received many assurances from the administration specifically a piece of that they currently do not have any designs that would be considered hostile architecture. They have no interest or plans to adopt such designs, which, you know, if that is still the case, and I have no reason to believe it is not based on my, you know, purview of the community, I think that would satisfy this. I would, you know, as always, as a counselor and as a legislator, leave it to my colleagues to consider whether they feel in the future, just having this discussion be fully resolved via ordinance would be their interest. I know that there&#39;s not the committee where those actions will be taken, but I think the conversation that we&#39;ve just had really does underline the importance of having a word in its language that says, this is our operating standard around hours, around, uh, how we build public space. Uh, and at this point, uh, with these changes, uh, being made into the language, I would be satisfied, uh, voting for this Thursday. Uh, but do want to just note that technically there is no, uh, piece of policy against uh hostile architecture it&#39;s just that we do have not proactively uh adopted any designs or attempted to create it on the city side all right thanks counseling uh</td>

Okay, good. I just wanted to make sure. So it&#39;s just this other park hours that we&#39;re going to change. Very good.</td>
