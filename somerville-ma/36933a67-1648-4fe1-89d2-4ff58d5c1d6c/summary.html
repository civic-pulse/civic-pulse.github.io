<p><strong>Executive Summary:</strong>
The Finance Committee met to address a fourteen-item agenda. Key actions included the withdrawal of a grant request for the Police Department's Special Response Team equipment (ID 25-0848) for consolidation with a larger grant. The committee recommended approval for the disposal of 78 abandoned bicycles to the YMCA (ID 25-1086) and a 10-year contract for the Greater Boston Bike Share Program, Blue Bikes (ID 25-1068). Additionally, a lease renewal for the Grove Street parking lot (ID 25-0978) and a time-only extension for a contract with Franklin Cummings Institute (ID 25-1001) were recommended for approval. Discussions on the 299 Broadway project's Urban Center Housing Tax Increment Financing (UCH TIF) agreement (ID 25-1160) and associated public access easements (ID 25-1163, ID 25-1164) led to the withdrawal of the easement items for revision and resubmission to address concerns regarding park operating hours and "hostile architecture."</p>

<h3 id="agenda-item-8-id-25-1086-mayor-requesting-authorization-to-dispose-of-bicycles-previously-abandoned-in-the-city-of-somerville-to-a-charitable-organization">Agenda Item 8: ID 25-1086 - Mayor requesting authorization to dispose of bicycles previously abandoned in the City of Somerville to a charitable organization.</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong> Chief Benford presented the proposal to donate approximately 78 abandoned bicycles to the YMCA.<ul>
<li>The YMCA was selected due to its capacity to take on the volume of bikes, its agreement to repair them, and its commitment to equitable distribution to the community, without requiring YMCA membership.</li>
<li>Other local non-profits like Bike Kitchen, Bikes Not Bombs, Groundwork Somerville, and Bike to See were considered but lacked the capacity.</li>
<li>The program aims to promote sustainable transportation, enhance community health, advance equity, foster positive community relations, and promote bicycle safety.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Public Comment:</strong> None.</li>
<li><strong>Key Discussion Points:</strong><ul>
<li>Councilor Wilson inquired if Cambridge Bike Give Back was considered. Chief Benford stated they focused on local in-city organizations initially but would consider them for future iterations. Legislative Liaison Hutter confirmed this would be a recurring process, and new agreements would be made for additional bikes.</li>
<li>Councilor Burnley asked if recipients would need to be YMCA members. Chief Benford confirmed that membership is not required.</li>
<li>Councilor Mbah inquired about city policy or ordinance governing the disposal of abandoned property. Assistant City Solicitor Jake Peek explained there is an internal policy for surplus municipal property, amended to allow disposition by donation to charity for less than fair market value, as permitted by state statute 30B section 15.</li>
<li>Assistant City Solicitor Peek clarified that bicycles are deemed abandoned after a public notice period (approximately 6 months), during which the city posted descriptions and serial numbers, and advised potential owners to claim them. The notice was posted on February 26th.</li>
<li>Chief Benford reiterated the criteria for selecting the charitable organization: capacity to intake and repair bikes, and an equitable distribution process.</li>
</ul>

<li><strong>Public Comment:</strong> None.</li>
<li><strong>Key Discussion Points:</strong><ul>
<li>Councilor Wilson expressed a desire for more Blue Bike stations in underserved areas, specifically mentioning the Mystics, Healy School, Blessing the Bay Boathouse, Lincoln Park, Argenziano, Capuano, Glen Park, 165 Broadway, and Dillboy Stadium.

<li><strong>Public Comment:</strong> None.</li>
<li><strong>Key Discussion Points:</strong><ul>

<h3 id="agenda-item-12-id-25-1160-mayor-requesting-approval-of-the-final-urban-center-housing-tax-increment-financing-uch-tif-agreement-for-the-299-broadway-project">Agenda Item 12: ID 25-1160 - Mayor requesting approval of the final Urban Center Housing Tax Increment Financing (UCH TIF) agreement for the 299 Broadway project.</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong> Ben Demers, Senior Planner, Real Estate Specialist, OSPCD, presented the final UCH TIF agreement for the 299 Broadway project.<ul>
<li>The UCH TIF program, managed by the state's Executive Office of Housing and Livable Communities (HLC), allows municipalities to provide a real estate tax exemption on the increased value of improved real estate for up to 20 years to support housing and commercial development, especially affordable housing.</li>
<li>In 2023, the City Council conditionally agreed to a 100% exemption on the increment for 20 years.</li>
<li>The project involves 319 new housing units (136 deed-restricted affordable), retail space, two public civic spaces, and a community room.</li>
<li>An independent real estate consultant, Abramson &amp; Associates, confirmed that the full exemption is still needed for a reasonable return on investment.</li>
<li>The updated agreement reflects changes approved by the ZBA, including an increase in unit count.</li>
<li>The agreement will be signed by the Mayor, sent to HLC, and recorded with the Middlesex South Registry of Deeds.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Public Comment:</strong> None.</li>
<li><strong>Key Discussion Points:</strong><ul>
<li>Councilor Wilson confirmed that the financial analysis indicated the full UCH TIF is still necessary due to construction costs and projected rental revenues.</li>
<li>Councilor Burnley inquired about the September groundbreaking timeline and the financial implications of the UCH TIF. Attorney Kathy Lester Salkert clarified that the UCH TIF defers taxes on the <em>increment</em> of value, while taxes on the base unimproved value continue to be paid.</li>
<li>Councilor Mbah sought clarification on the different financing mechanisms (TIF, DIF, UCH TIF). Director Ned Carney explained that UCH TIF is a specific state program for housing in commercial areas, currently only applied in Winter Hill. Alan Inasio added that District Improvement Financing (DIF) was used at Clarendon Hill for infrastructure and Section 108 financing is also being pursued.</li>

<h3 id="agenda-item-14-id-25-1164-mayor-requesting-approval-of-a-maintenance-access-easement-and-landscape-management-and-maintenance-plan-for-299-broadway-property-owner-llc-for-the-future-sewell-park-at-the-299-broadway-development-facility">Agenda Item 14: ID 25-1164 - Mayor requesting approval of a maintenance, access, easement, and landscape management and maintenance plan for 299 Broadway Property Owner LLC for the future Sewell Park at the 299 Broadway development facility.</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong> Attorney Kathy Lester Salkert explained that these easements are being executed in advance to provide predictability for financers.<ul>
<li>The agreements cover the Broadway Pocket Park and Sewell Park, connected by a pedestrian mews.</li>
<li>A single landscape maintenance and management plan covers all three areas.</li>
<li>Sewell Park will be purchased by the SRA using a MassWorks grant, developed, and then conveyed to the city.</li>
<li>The property owner grants 24/7 public access to the mews and Temple Street Passageway, and 8 AM to sunset access to the Broadway Park and Plaza.</li>
<li>The property owner is responsible for maintenance and repairs of civic spaces and pedestrian access areas.</li>
<li>Any changes to civic space require city approval.</li>
<li>Sewell Park is transferred in perpetuity to the city, with the property owner responsible for its maintenance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Public Comment:</strong> None.</li>
<li><strong>Key Discussion Points:</strong><ul>
<li>Councilor Scott praised the detailed nature of the documents but raised a concern about the absence of language prohibiting "hostile architecture" in fixed furnishings. Brett McDonald, attorney for the developer, directed attention to Condition 83 of the comprehensive permit, which requires PSOP approval for all landscape construction plans, including outdoor furniture.</li>
<li>Councilor Wilson questioned the "sunset" closing time for the Broadway Park and Plaza, noting that city ordinances typically specify 10 PM to 8 AM for park closures. Scott Lombardi from Mark Development stated their intent was to follow city ordinances.</li>
<li>Legislative Liaison Kimberly Hutter confirmed that both items (ID 25-1163 and ID 25-1164) would be withdrawn and new items submitted for Thursday's agenda to incorporate changes regarding park operating hours.</li>
<li>Councilor Mbah requested a clean, updated document for review by Thursday.</li>
