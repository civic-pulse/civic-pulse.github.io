Our first item on our next item on the agenda is number two that&#39;s requesting approval of a home rule petition to raise the sound business practices and written quote contract thresholds under mgl chapter 30b for city contracts with certified disadvantaged businesses so hopefully we can on the screen place up the hrp text and i would invite director allen from procurement who is here with us tonight to come in and give a brief introduction or iga if that&#39;s the preferred Let me just say at the outset, I&#39;m excited about this and looking forward to it.

                <td>Good evening. Through the chair, Counselor Scott to the committee. It&#39;s great to be here. IGA, do you want to speak or do you want me to dive on in? Through the chair to Angela. That&#39;s fine. You can go ahead. Cool. Okay. Yes, through the chair to the committee, I am very pleased to tell you about this proposed home rule petition from the city to, as you just read, Councilor Scott, to raise the current threshold, which is the one in the statute, the Uniform Procurement Act called Chapter 30B of Mass General Laws, from its current value of $10,000 up to $20,000 only if those contracts were goods and services, the business we would conduct up to that cap of $20,000 would be with a certified disadvantaged business, including minority and women owned businesses, veteran owned businesses, LGBTQ owned businesses, and other categories identified by the either the Massachusetts Supplier Diversity Office, or by the city of Boston that has its own certification program. Or third, that we would have clear and measurable discretion in the city. We will not have our own certification program in Somerville, but if we receive an application for work or seek a quote business, for example, from a company that is housed in Rhode Island or another jurisdiction that is certified as a disadvantaged business through an agency that has a recognized certification program that mirrors the same standards as Massachusetts, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts or the city of Boston. We would want to be able to accept those as well up to that dollar value. The other thing that this home rule petition would enable us to do should we move forward with it and have it accepted by the legislature is that we would raise the current threshold for what we call a quoted contract. currently that the band, the procurement threshold dollar values are between 10,000, starting at 10,000 up to and including $50,000. We would raise that $50,000 up to $250,000, which is the current, it&#39;s called the simplified acquisition threshold, which is what the Commonwealth of Massachusetts uses. we would actually tie it to that benchmark instead of naming the exact dollar amount. That would be what I would recommend. And that would enable us to use this simplified procurement process called a quoted process, also only for certified disadvantaged businesses, certified by the same agencies that I referenced moments ago. This aligns with an existing home rule petition that Boston successfully petitioned for and obtained in 2022, I believe. I&#39;ve spoken with their office, my counterparts there about how it&#39;s going, how it&#39;s being received. They were very enthusiastic about its reception in the city of Boston. And the city of Cambridge also has a current similar petition pending with the legislature. And I believe Somerville should join in that effort as well. And that in a nutshell is what the Home Rule petition would enable us to do. I&#39;m happy to accept any questions that you may have through the chair to the committee.</td>

So I just want to make sure that I understand kind of in plain language what this would actually do if we were so lucky to get this pass. So for procurement of less than 20,000, am I correct? Basically, it would streamline the process for us to do procurement if we&#39;re awarding the contract to a disadvantaged business, diverse business. Is that right?</td>

What it would do is we would not have to seek competitive quotes under $20,000. If we have a known supplier, for example, let&#39;s just say a graphic artist who like we need to have t-shirts and various things printed from a certified business that we know is here, local business, we could just set up a contract. We would still need a written contract. Um, other ordinances would apply that are set at the 10,000 mark, but we don&#39;t have to see competitive quotes. It would streamline it, say, Hey, we can, we can button up a contract with you. Um, so that&#39;s one example.</td>

It&#39;s a more intensive process. It would have to be advertised. It would take longer time. What we could do instead is identify at least three businesses that have a certification as a disadvantaged business and seek quotes from them. So we&#39;d send them, you know, this is what we need, this is our price form, our contract, and we would only compete that opportunity with certified disadvantaged businesses for certain contract types. That&#39;s how that would work. It&#39;s easier than the process the current state laws require us to follow.</td>

I think having seen the results of our disparity study, having kind of worked on this for a long time, I think this makes a lot of sense. I think of this basically as starting to level the playing field. My general understanding is, especially for newer businesses that don&#39;t have a long history of contracting with municipalities, it&#39;s really... you know, there is a major, major, major advantage to companies that have been doing this for a long time and kind of have the existing kind of flywheel going on these permitting and taking action like this really will kind of help smaller businesses that have historically kind of been locked out from the process. So I&#39;m glad that this is before us. I want to thank all the staff that worked on this and I look forward to hearing from colleagues.</td>

It may not, it&#39;s not necessarily a fit for all contract types, but we would review with each department. Again, this is down the road, but we&#39;ve already thought about how would we implement this. consult our existing vendor pool. And we have lists of certified vendors from the city of Boston and from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. And we&#39;ll look and say, are there enough? Are there at least three contractors that fill potholes as one example? And then we would seek quotes only from them for that opportunity. That&#39;s one example. That would be different from the current process, which is now, what we do is if the contract is valued, let&#39;s say it&#39;s valued at $200,000, we need to advertise a bid and we still contact all those vendors. We say, hey, Somerville is looking for pothole filling companies that do this work. We need your help. Here is the forms you fill out. Please bid on this job. But they are competing with other companies that are not certified vendors. So what this home rule petition, if the city council approves it and the legislature accepts it as well, we would be able to have a marketplace for certain contracts where it makes sense for the city, where there are enough available vendors who have that certification. We would make sure that a certified vendor gets that contract. That&#39;s the difference from what we&#39;re currently do versus what the Home Rule petition would enable us to do.</td>

Everything sounds... great that sounds logical right but if i sort of think through like where the potential pitfalls um it&#39;s kind of that like when do we decide to use this process versus not when do we what if there&#39;s more than three companies do we get to pick and choose or get to is probably not you know you know would it would we be able to pick and choose and is that the right thing to do um and so is it Is it the thinking, and do we know if the other cities who are going down this road have talked publicly about their plans in terms of, will we have a clear, set, transparent procedure for exactly how this will be implemented? I know that you just touched on that, but if there&#39;s any more detail you can provide, I&#39;d appreciate it. If not, then we&#39;ll look forward to having that conversation if and when the petition goes forward and if it&#39;s granted.</td>

                <td> Um, yes, through the chair to you, counselor Davis, I appreciate the question. And, um, I, I really appreciate also that, uh, counselors like yourself are thinking about implementation. How does this actually look on the ground? How it sounds great on paper. Is it going to work? Um, so my answer to this question is that, um, We&#39;ve already given it some careful thought. We don&#39;t have an exact plan yet because we&#39;re not there yet. I have spoken in depth with the city of Boston who actually has a program that they&#39;ve been running for a few years. And one approach I would advocate for is to do an audit of contracts that fall in that up to $250,000 category work with those departments look at existing who what vendors have done this work in the past um we don&#39;t want to displace an incumbent local vendor that has does excellent work so we might not compete every 250 000 contract under this we have to look at which vendors are on the marketplace but we&#39;re still inviting everyone to come bid on this opportunity um but that elevated increased threshold would only be available for the certified businesses. So we would need to have a process in the city that is not yet set up. It would depend on the passage of this home rule petition, but I have ideas of how to do that and how to market those opportunities further in advance and drum up interest and preparation for contractors on the marketplace who have the certifications that make them eligible for such contracts. to say, hey, Somerville is throwing me a bone. I&#39;ve got this great, hey, let&#39;s go for this. Keep certain people on staff, whatever it is that enables them to compete for that contract. Something that is in the question you asked is, I believe, what would the rule for award be? How do you pick the three? So I&#39;m gonna interpret your question this way, is how do you pick which three We could offer a contract to, we could seek quotes, I should say, not offer it. We would seek quotes from at least three certified vendors that offer the good or service that we are seeking. They have to be certified and they have to meet certain minimum requirements. We will state what those are for the given contract. And it&#39;s the one, the contractor that meets those minimum requirements that And submits the lowest price, so we still that&#39;s the rule for a word that is stated in the Statute we&#39;re not changing that so that&#39;s how we would select the word a word the contract and that is consistent with with current law what we&#39;re doing is. We are. having the marketplace for that particular contract only competed among certified disadvantaged businesses council davis you&#39;re all set yep thank you mr chair that&#39;s excellent i appreciate the response and that&#39;s all i got for now</td>

I guess I&#39;m curious as to how much extensive vetting is in those processes as opposed to just what we might have available, which is a history of old contracts and bids where people selected WME or some other category on their previous bids.</td>

Um, so the language I drafted and vetted, uh, with, uh, wonderful support from our city solicitor&#39;s office and IGA team, um, really mirrors very closely the language in Cambridge&#39;s home rule petition. which they based on Boston&#39;s. And there was a, so it lists exactly as you said, the supplier diversity offices certification process and the city of Boston&#39;s, both of which are quite rigorous. I believe the state&#39;s process is more rigorous and there&#39;ve been anecdotal complaints about it. I personally have never had an issue with it, but I think it is quite a heavy lift to manage such a certification program. Boston has their own program, and they&#39;ve been very cooperative with us in sharing their lists. It is publicly available. It needs to be easy to use, and the goal is also to incentivize vendors to get certified. Like, there needs to be something in it for them. But going back to the language in the draft home rule petition, we did have a clause in there saying that the city of Somerville could also, by virtue of our own certification, I&#39;d like to work with this committee and our legislative policy analysts, others who know, advise on the clearest language, but to enable the city Exactly what I believe you&#39;re suggesting, Chair Counselor Scott, is what if we have a supplier come forth? We know of a supplier that is not certified by the Supplier Diversity Office, nor by the City of Boston, but we know that supplier is a veteran-owned business, for example, or a minority-owned business. Can&#39;t we offer them this opportunity? So I would like to look at that and say, well, are they certified by any agency? I think it is important that there is a body out there that has some standards, whether it&#39;s, I don&#39;t know, I&#39;m not going to go into all those details now, but you can get certified in different states. There&#39;s the Department of Transportation at the federal level has a has had a robust supplier diversity and small business disadvantaged business program for years and every state in the United States has such a program. So we&#39;d wanna look at what do you have? What can you furnish to us that gives us what we need? And that would be part of ironing out what the implementation looks like. We wanna lower the barriers, but we don&#39;t wanna lower the standards, if that makes sense.</td>

Because obviously, you know, you receive bids all the time from folks who check the box saying veteran or WME and some kind of certification you have to do. If they&#39;re not already certified on a list, you see that checkbox and you say, OK, show me some documentation that proves that this is the case. uh or maybe maybe i&#39;m presuming too far but um that would be what i would guess yes uh on you know on that basis especially with companies we&#39;ve already done business with you know we&#39;ve done the contract like you said we know they&#39;re a veteran local business or something like that uh i i would definitely be eager to allow for in the home rule petition a pathway that will allow for uh some business with that kind of track record locally that maybe has gone through all the other certification hoops to still be eligible for this.

There is some concern about wording in the first sentence of section two, which frankly, I don&#39;t necessarily share the concern, but understand why it&#39;s there. In the language there at the bottom of that page saying, from not fewer than three disadvantaged businesses, Analyst Salisbury&#39;s recommendation would be moving that final clause of customarily providing the supplier service up to right after the number three there, basically saying three businesses customarily providing the supplier service that are than disadvantaged businesses, etc. I think I understand the concern there, but it&#39;s not one that I&#39;m as fired up about. Before I go to my second point here, let me offer Analyst Salisbury, do you have a substantive reason why that change is important?</td>

And the concern is that if there is, that there would be a presumption that the city clerk would be responsible for any certification or administration process that would create a local certification, which isn&#39;t necessarily what I heard from Director Allen there.

So to clarify just a little bit, it&#39;s my understanding that we do not have a certification process that is substantively similar to the City of Boston or the Supplier Diversity Office on the state level. And so it is the... It is my recommendation that we avoid using language that purports to utilize a standard that does not exist, because historically, when questions arise about a thing that does not exist but appears to exist according to state law, The most frequent person to receive questions about that is the city clerk&#39;s office. We are sort of the one-stop shop for many issues within the city. And it is the opinion of the city clerk that she does not have the appropriate expertise or qualifications to certify businesses in this way and would not want to have that expectation be disappointed for our local businesses.</td>

So that does insinuate that they&#39;re not necessarily that one exists currently, but that one might, which I think is the room we&#39;re trying to allow here. Is that right, Director Allen, that in the future there may be a process, even if that process is simply as abbreviated as you are a supplier who has previously done business with City of Somerville as representing yourself as a WME veteran owned or other category specified, correct?</td>

So first off, I, end of the day, completely agree with your final statement, which is that this is a mechanism for asking the Commonwealth to enable us to do something. And so leaving us the flexibility to do that thing is in our interest to the extent that it doesn&#39;t impact our likelihood of getting it passed. I guess at its crux, I think I&#39;m not hearing a clear connection between what exactly we&#39;re saying here. To me, it sounds like there&#39;s two concepts. One concept is at some point in the future, we may establish and put in place and budget foreign staff or whatever is necessary, a certification process of our own. Another Another possible interpretation or path or parallel reality is that we might decide that XYZ company, even if they don&#39;t otherwise meet City of Boston or Commonwealth of Massachusetts or some other state certification, are good because they meet all the conceptual things that the others do. And we want that to just be our yes, okay. I&#39;d be a little more concerned about that because it feels less structured and transparent and more open to... nefarious things that governments sometimes do. Hopefully never again in the future, but these things happen. So I guess I&#39;d just like a little clarification from the director, if I could. Is the idea, when you talked about flexibility, that we might establish a transparent program or that there might be a vendor who so clearly checks the boxes that even though they don&#39;t otherwise meet any certification, we want them to be able to be one of the three?</td>

I had it myself when I read Cambridge&#39;s language and prepared ours, and we&#39;ve discussed this internally with our colleagues here in the city, and I&#39;m glad to discuss it with you. So to answer your question, it is, to allow for flexibility, not be so rigid to just these two programs, because they&#39;re not the only two out there. We certainly, so anyway, we would need to define what those standards are. And I appreciate the city clerk&#39;s office saying, this could come to us, that needs to be established. We don&#39;t have that yet. We don&#39;t have the home rule petition yet. But I think, Today, if this were to go into effect tomorrow, I&#39;d say we would want to see an official letter from the issuer that has certified you as a business in Rhode Island, New Hampshire, California, the federal government, Kentucky, wherever it may be, and what the process is, and we will accept this. It&#39;ll be a notation. I do want to leave the door open for some sort of future I don&#39;t see that being a direction we will go, but I can&#39;t speak for my colleague who isn&#39;t here from OSPCD, Luis Quixpe, who was the project manager of the disparity study, but he was very in favor of the concept of a community compact and saying that there&#39;s anecdotally in the vendor community, especially disadvantaged vendors, local certifications or local recognition of a business&#39;s status is very desirable. I firmly believe there has to be some guidance so that I&#39;m not making a judgment call at my desk when I get a bid. There needs to be documentation furnished. So I use the language that Cambridge did. We&#39;ve embedded it internally. I fully am open to edits to it that would make it clearer. I would advocate that we retain some flexibility as a city to allow disadvantaged businesses that might not be certified by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts or the city of Boston also to be considered for this opportunity.</td>

Right. And so I think that my, you know, just my sort of initial thought in terms of the concern raised by the clerk&#39;s office, I think is perfectly valid, you know, would be, and maybe to make the language a little more reflective of what you just described is, you know, but, you know, something like, you know, by virtue of a certification process that, you know, may be established by Somerville or something that, you know, that sort of acknowledges that if we take steps to say, to establish a process, right? If we take some steps to put a process in place, then that will be good. That&#39;ll be good enough as well. But not that by virtue of certification by Somerville, therefore call the clerk and ask how to get certified, right? It may still be called the clerk and find out if there is a certification process, the answer is no, we don&#39;t have one yet. So you got to go to the other ones, right? Which would be, I think that it&#39;s going to be is what it is. Does that make sense? And to my colleagues who like is, or I guess maybe to you, Mr. Salisbury, you know, Could you noodle with some words along those lines that might address that concern?</td>

                <td>Mr. Chair, through you too, Councillor Davis, I could certainly consider that. I think, and Director Allen, please correct me if I&#39;m wrong as well. I want to restate what you and I had talked about and also what you&#39;ve stated here. I think also introducing some language regarding certification from other entities beyond the Supplier Diversity Office, the City of Boston, or the City of Somerville. I do think that we could probably replace the language of by virtue of certification by Somerville with something like by virtue of certification by another... certification by another agency with similar standards, which would, I think, still leave the door open for us in the future to become an agency that certifies using similar standards. So I do just want to throw that out there.</td>

                <td>If I could, Councilor Davis, just a thought. Of course, of course, Mr. Chair, please. Thank you. So I get what you&#39;re getting at there, and I certainly would not want to put us in a situation where the presumption is, hey, you know, Jim and John and Joey have three companies. They&#39;re the approved companies. They&#39;re the ones we&#39;re going to go to. I think as impossible it is to legislate good behavior, I think it&#39;s also at the home rule petition state one where I&#39;d want to be perhaps a little bit more broad It occurs to me that language here along the lines of, you know, instead of, or by virtue of certification by Somerville, it could be, or by virtue of certification by Somerville, according to regulations promulgated by the procurement, director of procurement. It could even be promulgated by director of procurement and approved by the city council. I mean, there&#39;s, There could definitely be safeguards in place so that whatever those procedures are, are things that get reviewed and approved rather than just appearing in straight, you know, becoming just a matter of past practice. So, analyst Salisbury, while you&#39;re considering language, I want to put that in there. I did have a thought as we were talking about certification by other agencies, I can certainly understand. the possibility of, say, the Federal Department of Transportation promulgating a list of disadvantaged businesses because they are owned by people who were previously convicted of trespassing at the U.S. Capitol in 2020, for example. And certainly that would not necessarily be a list that would be looking to apply here. So having there being an option of which standards we could take into consideration here, which is what&#39;s allowed in this language here is something that I&#39;d be interested in. And again, I generally err on the side of not being overly prescriptive in terms of which certification standards can be selected at this point or which eligibility standards are, certification standards are eligible and rather go with some of that language that Analyst Salisbury was talking about saying that they, you know, or some language about standards that are found to be acceptable certifications by the director of procurement or something along those lines. So it&#39;s just my general thoughts because it sounds like what we&#39;re looking at right now is doing a little drafting between now and our next meeting and hopefully coming back with some language that satisfies everybody&#39;s concerns and then moves forward. I do see Solicitor Amara. Solicitor Amara, I&#39;m going to recognize you just in case there&#39;s a, what do you have on your mind here?</td>

But I think the goal and the point of this is to give Somerville the flexibility to create its own process for certification. And what that is down the road, I don&#39;t know. But a process for certification, which could be you&#39;re on another state. You&#39;ve done business for 10 years at over $50,000. I mean, we could create whatever those standards are. And one thing I will defer to Angela on, I don&#39;t know if we would then have to get any sort of approval from anyone for our certification. But we would also, we would want to make sure that the safeguards are put in place, that it&#39;s a process, that it&#39;s not a, oh, I like this contractor because they did a good job on my yard and they gave me a good discount. No, it&#39;s going to be an objective sort of certification process. So I just wanted to say that is the goal. And if we need to go back and work on some language, we&#39;re happy to do so.</td>

I fully respect and appreciate the time and effort that went into this. I think that the clerk&#39;s office has raised a concern, which my read of this language seems very valued, or by virtue of certification by Somerville, leaves a lot to the imagination and, frankly, might raise concerns on Beacon Hill, right? That we might be talking about, we like JT and Lance&#39;s construction business, and therefore we&#39;re just going to give them, you know, right? So, you know... At the risk of sort of trying to oversimplify this, like certification by a process as may be established by Somerville or something along those lines seems fairly straightforward. I don&#39;t think that changes. I think the only thing that does is clarify and narrow the meaning. I certainly would defer to the solicitor&#39;s office if there&#39;s concerns with that. My suggestion would be to make a change along those lines either tonight or Thursday and move forward unless there&#39;s some other compelling reason not to get this going.</td>

Of course, it&#39;s always the will of the committee, but my inclination would be to take this discussion and let them run with it for a hot minute, and also allows them to compare with notes with Cambridge and Boston, who have also gotten similar language through the HRP process, in case there&#39;s anything that they felt that they got flagged through the legislative process that was a close call for them, for example.</td>

This is a home rule petition requesting approval of home rule petition to raise the maximum amount of fines for violations allowed by MGL chapter 40, section 21B. And this is another one of those that I&#39;m very excited about this evening. Thanks to the administration for bringing this forward.

I&#39;m joined here today with my colleagues, Deputy Director Matt Zaino, as well as Environmental Health Coordinator Alicia Purvett, to present this home rule petition to committee to discuss the ability for city departments and the city itself to increase the maximum violation fines from $300, which was introduced in the 80s, which we all know inflation and the cost of things has increased substantially since then, and to catch up with our regional partners like Boston, who have passed a similar home rule petition back in 2024. Just for clarity, this home rule petition does not change the violation maximum immediately. It just gives the city and departments and the council the ability to restructure fines, how we issue them, what they&#39;re issued for, and negotiate those through the correct channels and processes. So we&#39;re here tonight to answer any questions you might have, comments, suggestions, to make edits that we can come back to you with, or what&#39;s appropriate. So looking forward to the discussion. Thank you.</td>

My reading of this is that if proved, this would allow us to raise that maximum fine to $2,000 currently, and then every five years to index that change for inflation. based on the annual percentage change of CPI. So if I&#39;ve got that wrong, please feel free to flag me on it. There is one note that came up about the section, maximum fines set forth shall be adjusted for inflation. on January 1st, 2025, and on January 1st, every five years thereafter, given that we&#39;re playing pretty far past January 1st, 2025, it would seem to be, I would be inclined to just set that at January 1st, 2026, because it&#39;s not like there&#39;s an off year problem for CPI, just to allow it to start getting indexed on a first possible year after that. Does that, would that make sense to y&#39;all? All right, I don&#39;t hear any, I don&#39;t hear anybody. All right, great. All right, then let me give the floor over as usual to colleagues.

And oftentimes that it&#39;s, we have an ordinance, we have a law, but Effectively, there&#39;s no meaning whatsoever to the way that we can enforce our ordinances. Sometimes there&#39;s little, you know, tricks and ways that we apply it. But, you know, if... If there&#39;s ever been a bigger no-brainer from a really substantive issue, I&#39;m not aware of it. This is obviously long overdue, and it really cuts to the city&#39;s ability to meet the expectations of our constituents, whether it&#39;s garbage disposal that goes directly to our effort to... mitigate the rat issues, whether it goes to vacant property ordinance, whether it goes to any number of other things that were hamstrung by the current status of our fine limits, noise ordinance, as another example for construction sites.

I was also waiting to hear the good director, you know, to say this is, you know... In particular, one of the things we&#39;ve heard in the past is mostly construction, because if they violate, you know, there&#39;s a violation, they can pay $300. That&#39;s nothing. They can pay even, you know, a hundred times over. So one of the things I was hoping to hear was just, you know, that this is not for small violations like, you know, traffic, parking rules, you know, littering, you know, there&#39;s like all this. So I guess which brings me to the question, like, what are the categories of violation that are the most common and which are the worst problems that a large fine will be expected to remedy?</td>

The basis of the home rule petition would just be to give us the ability to. But of course, there would be no capricious, you know, sort of application of larger fines for minor violations. The intention of this would be to issue violations for more egregious things or long-term problems without response. But each of those will have to be negotiated in the proper processes internally within departments first to the council, the public will have to weigh in, of course. This is not something that&#39;s just going to be waved around and just done willy-nilly, essentially.</td>

Anyway, but yes, this has been long overdue because one of the things, you know, I had a million times over is about construction. They don&#39;t care. They don&#39;t pay, you know, and the fine is very, you know, minimal for them that they don&#39;t even care. You know, so yeah, so that&#39;s like, for me, this is like, this will go, you know, it should even be, we should even double this for certain violations even. This is 2,000 even still. For me, I feel like we should even increase it, like just have a certain category and then slam them so that they don&#39;t have to, you know, when they see that, they will stop, you know, creating any violation that will hurt our neighbors and constituents that will cause every day for the same issues.

All of those fines and penalties are set forth in city ordinance. So any recommended change to a penalty would have to go to the city council for approval and would be reflected in ordinance. So the... the possibilities for any kind of shenanigans are already under oversight. All right, are there any other questions from colleagues on this? All right, then just to the point that I made at the very start, which is similar to a point that was raised by by analyst Salisbury. Is there a reason why we wouldn&#39;t change this date of the first indexing to January 1st, 2026, instead of 2025, just so we don&#39;t have to wait a full four and a half years until our first indexing?</td>

So just gonna give a little background and context on this item. Hopefully this sounds a little familiar. I believe all of the committee members were counselors in 2019 when the new zoning ordinance was passed. So part of the zoning ordinance was a restriction on eligibility for parking permits for residents of new developments within half a mile of a transit station. And I do want to note that restrict is not applied to properties that are zoned neighborhood residents or NR. And so. In addition to this being included in the zoning ordinance, a subsequent traffic regulation was passed by the traffic commission, again, enabling this restriction on parking permits for specific addresses in transit areas. and so a major component of the restriction is that prospective residents should be informed before they sign a lease or buy a unit that they would not be eligible for parking permits and the idea is that they&#39;ll have you know informed choice about their housing and you know can make an informed decision based on their individual needs you know for a car or you know if they&#39;re car free And so while the zoning ordinance language places specific conditions about advertising and disclosing this restriction to projects that apply for a discretionary or administrative permits or what we refer to as special permits, so projects that go to planning board, et cetera, there&#39;s currently no avenue for the city to enforce this regulation for projects that are by right. And so right now at the direction of our legal department, the strongest thing that we have, kind of tool that we have at our disposal right now is to send certified letters to property owners of, again, projects that are by right. and we can suggest that they notify tenants prior to signing a lease or buying a unit um but that obviously does not offer you know the guarantee that they will be informed of this restriction which is what we want to make sure is happening and so this has again created a separate kind of rules for special permit projects versus buy right projects even though both types of projects are subject to this parking restriction and so tenants regardless of if you&#39;re living in a special permit building you know a building that was built through special permit or by right again you are not eligible for parking permits and so the goal of this ordinance is to strengthen the advertisement and notification requirements for these property owners and to close the existing loophole and give us the ability to enforce this restriction for all projects equally and it&#39;ll bring it to we&#39;ve included that there&#39;s a form prescribed by the parking department and so again developed uh by parking and approved by inspectional services as well um we&#39;ll make sure that the projects are using again a standardized form that has been approved by city staff so that all tenants are receiving the same language and that we make sure that you know they&#39;re all getting the same information And this was, yeah, this was a joint effort between parking, ISD, legal, IGA, and the clerk&#39;s office. So I also want to thank my colleagues in those departments for their effort on this. And yeah, with that, we&#39;re here to answer any questions that you may have.</td>

                <td>All right. Thank you for that. So just as a summary, this is very much in accordance with the intent that went in with our original drafting and with our zoning ordinance. But this simply covers the gap for projects that are by right, which currently is predominantly urban residential projects, which are apartment buildings at four stories that would be allowed by right. But there is also, I know great interest from some of my colleagues and members of the public in making more projects available by right as opposed to through special permits. So this would also ensure that all of the communication that we&#39;ve intended as a council is uniformly executed. So hopefully that&#39;s a useful summary. I want to open it up to colleagues on the committee before I go into anything else further. Any colleagues on the committee with, all right, Councilor Ewen-Campen.</td>

That brings us to the end of our agenda in a very brisk 75 minutes and productive, might I also add. So seeing no further business before the committee this evening, I believe I see Councilor Ewen Campin moves to adjourn. On the motion to adjourn, is there any discussion? No?
