                <td> Excellent. I want to welcome everyone to the third night in a series of departmental budget hearings on the proposed FY 2026 budget. Thank you to the counselors who submitted questions for department heads to answer via memo. I trust we&#39;ve all had the opportunity to look over those memos that were uploaded to the budget book. I do want to flag the new format of budget season this year and the creation of Monday night&#39;s additional meeting for any follow up questions counselors might have for department after that department has already appeared before us. I haven&#39;t heard from any counselors yet who wish to call back department heads on Monday night, but just flagging that to make sure that you all know that that&#39;s there. In the event that one of us does have a department we want to bring back for additional questions on Monday night, just please make sure to indicate that tonight. That will allow us to make sure that we get that message to staff and that we have them there on Monday if a meeting is needed. So I&#39;ll make sure to put out a final call for requests at the end of the meeting. I just want to put that on your radar. As in past years, motions for cuts or resolutions for additional funding are in order. After we finish discussing that, Department of Division, any motions will get tabled until cut night on Tuesday, June 24th. And as always, I&#39;ll encourage anyone making one of those motions to please speak with our finance analyst, Muhammad Uddin, ahead of the 24th. All right, let&#39;s dig in. We&#39;re going to start with inspectional services. And I see inspectional services is there in the committee room, ready to go. Councillors, any follow-up questions on the memo from inspectional services or anything fresh? Councillor Burnley, first up.</td>

But I did want to follow up on a question That was mentioned in the memo from the department. It did reference the fact that less money was allocated to software services because short-term rentals have become more sophisticated. And my inference is that that meant more likely to avoid detection. As the director may know, in February, I put forward an order to determine how much money the city could gain by putting an additional community impact fee on short-term rentals. So I&#39;m curious from the ISD perspective, what investments have your department made to account for short-term rentals as they become harder to track?</td>

They were, I mean, obviously they&#39;re selling a product. They&#39;re going to make it sound as good as possible. But some of them even were able to do things like look at the, track the average rates that people are getting and give us some ammunition to go to the DOR and make arguments for additional revenue from the short-term rental scene here in Somerville. I&#39;ve talked to Director Bean about this. I won&#39;t betray any confidences and tell you Director Bean&#39;s response to this, but I&#39;ll just say I&#39;m really interested in digging in on this and seeing if one of these software packages might be hip to the tricks that we&#39;re seeing out there from Airbnb and others, because I just think it really... I think we want to be tracking this. I think we want to... we want to be on top of this and i would love to to follow up uh with director being possibly with y&#39;all and see if if there&#39;s something we can do um you know we have to figure out how to fund it but i&#39;m sure that uh we can get creative if need be because i think that this is something that would probably pay for itself um i don&#39;t know if you have a response to that but i just wanted to throw that out there in terms of other products uh that are out there, other vendors in that field.</td>

You know, I, to counselor Scott&#39;s point, this is something that, uh, has been on the books in some role for quite a while, uh, to my knowledge, uh, into the council&#39;s knowledge has never been enforced. Uh, and as far as I&#39;m aware, based on your comments has never, uh, had the investments or the administration never sought to have the investments to enforce it.

That&#39;s a question that&#39;s been asked to other departments, and for whatever reason, they don&#39;t necessarily jump out to say, yeah, we need more people. But I&#39;m certainly open to hearing that. And perhaps on the latter point, perhaps that&#39;s another discussion we can have in committee is what potential inefficiencies there are in the permitting process that could expedite ISD&#39;s role Because I&#39;m sure, as you know, this is something that can be a source of frustration for folks. And I&#39;m sure for the department as well, when they keep getting hounded by folks who are looking for whatever kind of inspection they need to get through the process.

That was the funding to attend the Mass Municipal Association Conference, and more counselors attended this year than ever in the previous years.

Yeah, I mean, the biggest thing that stands out, obviously, to me, I mean, I guess the two biggest things is how generally static, both how generally static this budget is over the years, and that&#39;s been a point that I&#39;ve mentioned in previous years, as well as the relative De-funding of the legal services line. I think this is a conversation that has been had many years in a row, so I won&#39;t elongate the process beyond its means, but I think it&#39;s certainly worth noting.</td>

Thank you. in order to respect the commission, to work enough to ask a question of my own, I&#39;ll just ask, through you, would any additional funding be necessary in order to do the work of creating new licensing types? And I ask this because I know that the clerk, as well as the city, as well as myself, both had the chance to meet recently with the Cannabis Control Commission to speak about three licensing types that they are in the process of creating. Hospitality license, new event organizer license, and a supplemental license. Although that process is not complete, and although fingers crossed for this September or slightly later for it to go to the state for final review, I&#39;m just curious if what work or funds might be necessary in order to do the work on our side to prepare for those new licenses.</td>

This actually was covered largely in the funding that the council provided to add an additional position to the city clerk&#39;s office that was that started about a year and a half ago. So with that, we are well underway with creating the infrastructure to support additional license types. And ultimately, what we are waiting on has nothing to do with money and more on regulations and a framework under which to implement those licenses.</td>

So I&#39;m just trying to look at the various data points so that everything makes sense to me. So when I look at the law department, it shows a small addition to your salary line, which is for conversion of a part-time paralegal to full-time. And the OM line has been reduced from, I think 768,000 actual spending to 646,000. But now when you look at the memo that was sent to us on May 29, also show a special item of 529,000 as part of the law department budget. So what is that?</td>

                <td> Okay. Yeah. So I&#39;m saying, because we got, we got, you know, like general fund appropriation order that was on May 29 of this year. So it has like so many different, you know, numbers. I also, I mean, there&#39;s like multiple numbers that I just want to make sense of, even including, I think the judgment that Solicitor Amari is saying is actually somewhere else also, like, is under judgment and settlement. So I don&#39;t see that as, you know, but this one, the money I&#39;m asking is under special items. When we got that memo on May 29, it shows the law department, you know, that personal service was a million, 1.7 million, ordinal maintenance, you know, was like $488,810 special items, $529,000.</td>

So also, when I&#39;m looking at it, so last year, the law department laid out a number of contracts for outside law firms for litigation, particularly 90 Washington Street. And also... the complicated contract work for the storm sewer treatment agreement with the state and other neighboring towns. So I&#39;m seeing that they required supplementary appropriation that raised the OM from the original appropriation of 676,000 to adjust it. There was this adjustment of $883,000. Although it appears that that you&#39;ve only spent 768,000 so far by end of May. So I&#39;m wondering if there are any additional like outside litigation or contract work that is outstanding.</td>

So then I&#39;m seeing like another large expense for fiscal year 25 was the unexpected order of the court to pay $60 million more for the 19 Washington Street. But this amount does not appear here in the law department budget. So, but it is shown in the supplemental cost that was added to the judgment and settlement budget line. That&#39;s where I actually find it. which had an original, you know, appropriation of 269,000. So if I see, like, for the fiscal year 2026, you know, it included in the line, it says, like, 3,864,000. So I&#39;m wondering, like, I see two different numbers. Right now, it actually says 250,000 is being reduced. So how do you reconcile that from... Like the May 29 memo, the budget was $3,864,000, but not at this current one, it says $250,000.</td>

                <td>Sure. Thank you again, Mike Mastroboni, Budget Director, to the Chair. Councilor Abbott, two different lines are actually In that organization, there&#39;s a building insurance and there&#39;s a judgments and settlements of claims. Is that why you&#39;re seeing the $1.887 million number? So that&#39;s two separate parts of what we do, but they&#39;re in the same organization. So the software bands them together. In terms of judgments and settlements of claims, you&#39;re right that we budgeted $270,000 in fiscal 25. spent $16,200,000 to settle the 90 Washington case. That&#39;s where that supplemental appropriation comes in. But you&#39;re also right that the fiscal 26 budgeted amount for this is $250,000. So be wary that the building insurance and judgments and settlements of claims are two separate programs within the city, two separate objects of expenditure, I should say, but they do come up in the same report. So Yeah, all that is to say, you&#39;re right, we&#39;re budgeting $250,000 for next year.</td>

I&#39;m just trying to make sure that they&#39;re all, they&#39;re adding up. Thank you for that. And the last piece that I find here is that, you know, another, you know, significant outside law firm cost for the city, you know, like we also like needed like the, program for legal assistance for immigrants and for low-income tenants were in danger of eviction.

But I didn&#39;t see any additional allocations to that line for FY26. So I&#39;m curious, what was it that made it? unless the budget book is incorrect, which has happened more than I would like.

The FY26 line for that does not increase to that 3,000 amount. Is that because those folks are going to be accredited and therefore won&#39;t need to take part in those efforts anymore, that your whole department or the necessary parts of the department will have that accreditation?</td>

It probably takes two to three years to become an assessor and you&#39;re taking two or three classes a year to achieve that.

It&#39;s probably a good time to tell the public if you bought a property in calendar year 2024, you will be eligible for the first time for the exemptions and please respond to our mailing because it hurts the community when we don&#39;t have timely application because it then doesn&#39;t come out of the tax rate.

In fact, we&#39;ve been actively evaluating the recommendations to determine what we can do with existing resources, existing staffing, existing level service budget, and what may require more. And it is not just the procurement and contracting services department. It is a cross-cutting effort as we&#39;ve discussed and OSPCD managed the project. So I&#39;d say for the time being, what&#39;s really important is that we fill the recently vacated deputy CPO position, because that is really a key position for the data reform recommendation that came out of the study. We have existing staff who have the skills we need, but It&#39;s going to tie into a bigger data management system for the city that we&#39;re evaluating. I will say we have actually this Friday, my team and I are meeting with the city of Boston&#39;s procurement office and supplier diversity team. And then separately with Cambridge&#39;s to just talk about the actual practice, like how did you implement these recommendations? So I believe I&#39;ll have something more concrete in the months ahead. to answer your question with more specifics, but in terms of resources, we&#39;re committed to using what we have because right now I feel like there&#39;s a lot we can do. We&#39;ve even started doing it. We put out a buying plan and we&#39;re updating that twice a year, forecasting to small disadvantaged businesses or local businesses as well that would actually bid on our opportunities in Somerville. But, yeah, it&#39;s really when we start the data work that I&#39;ll need to make sure I have the resources in my department as well as the other departments, namely the CAO is involved, IT, RSJ, OSPCD. So it&#39;s a multi-department effort.</td>

I&#39;m increasingly like falling in love, you know, and probably spend like part of my day, like, kind of wonder how I&#39;m going to approach PACS and RECS today. But I think I figured out, you know, we need to, I think it&#39;s good. We continue to strive to just optimize our system. So, When I look at PACS and RECS, first, thank you for your work. I think you&#39;re also one of those essential departments. And actually, I see that your department shows almost no significant change in either the salary or OM compared to last year. And I guess this is a little bit surprising to me because you know, I was hoping to see some significant improvement, you know, in recreation programs for kids during the summer and after school program, as well as improvement on your website and methods for parents to enroll their kids, you know. So, and why I say that, because like last year, you know, we had the same discussion about hiring lifeguards and other recreation supervisors and making sure that their salaries are sufficiently filled. And so I guess, does this year&#39;s budget contain all the funds that are required for these jobs? That&#39;s like just as simple as that.</td>

                <td>Yes. And a part of the reason why there wasn&#39;t that much of a change between last year&#39;s budget and this year&#39;s budget is that we did a deeper look on each account line. So if you do look at the individual account lines, you&#39;ll see that we did increase individual account lines more than the average 3% that we have for the whole budget. And those changes were based off of any transfers that we might have done historically. And just to make basically the budgets for each individual account line more accurate than what has been for the past two or three years. So even though the overall budget only increased by about 3%, if you look at the individual lines, we did increase things like professional services technology that we are anticipating larger increases for recreation supplies and just making more accurate adjustments based off of the actual spend and any transfers in and outs.</td>

                <td>Yes, and thank you. I will come back to that. And the main point was, like, usually it&#39;s to project if the swimming, if the fees are expected to go up, and if so, if it would be better, you know, to put some money into the borderlines to keep the cost for families low. That was where I was going with that question. So, I just want to leave it there so you understand, like, the exact rationale sometimes when people ask questions. So, but I guess another aspect of PACs and RECs also, Recreational Finances, are the expected capital costs and future operating costs for the anticipated new projects. So for example, when I went to like the website, there&#39;s like the CIP, Capital Improvement Plans, there&#39;s like a bunch of projects there, like the Art Farm, Boynton Yard, PACs, 2017 summer they have. So there&#39;s a lot of them. And if you see this, like the park related projects on the approved 2023 to 2029 CPI, most of the capital costs will be covered by the general obligation bond. And the impact will be on the debt service line for the city as a whole, like the park and recreation budget itself. So like, however, the way I see it is that there are portions of this cost that will not be bonded and are expected to have developer contributions. So the question that I have is what expectation does the department now has about its ability to carry forward the capital projects?</td>

I&#39;m just, I cannot make sense out of like something that if you add all these funds, you know, it&#39;s quite a lot. And. Mr. Chair, can I add the debt service? Can I add this into the debt service question? Because I&#39;m seeing most of my stuff really overlap. Is that okay? Because I know we also have debt service in the whole. Yeah, we have it coming up in non-departmental. It&#39;s a Parks and Rec debt service question? Yes.

And we do that together. Parks and Rec, through the CIP process, submits all their needs, just like every other department, and work through that. The challenge we have right now is the starkly different revenue projections that we&#39;re looking at from when we last developed a CIP. So to say what is and isn&#39;t projects that are underway or continuing, but in terms of what new projects we&#39;re going to start, I think that&#39;s a much longer conversation that we&#39;re looking forward to having as soon as we can.</td>

Because I can see, like, all this money, the Union Square Plaza, Dear Boy Field, Central Hill, like this stuff that is already... It&#39;s as if they are ongoing work.

Not even less ambitious, just adjusted relative to the new economic conditions. It will be thinner, more streamlined, more focused on maintaining core services and our existing assets rather than expanding assets. It&#39;s just kind of like the general fund budget. So yes, to answer your question, counselor.</td>

                <td>All right, thanks. Well, since we picked up the enterprise funds, I have a follow-up on my question about the Dillboy fees. I appreciate that response in there, roughly a little over $106,000 in actual revenues as of June 12th with an additional $40,000 expected. I&#39;m going to guess those are spring vendors who haven&#39;t yet paid their invoices for the field permit fees. Through the chair, correct. I know how that goes from being on the other side of it. So we&#39;re going to end up somewhere, expect somewhere around $150,000. That&#39;s roughly what we took in last year, as I recall. Last year when we had this discussion, you might recall I was excited about seeing what might happen with permanent fee revenue because of the pending opening of Rivas Field. and the impact there of shifting high school and some youth usage away from Dillboy with the hope that we could then, you know, get some organizations in there who are, I guess we&#39;ll say, paying full freight as opposed to the subsidized rate that local youth, you know, very rightfully get charged to use Dillboy. So I&#39;m going to guess with revenues looking like that, Did we instead, I guess my assumption was that we would see steady usage. Have we actually seen a decrease in permitted hours at Dillboy in this fiscal year?</td>

So we will be able to use Revis Field more for the high school and transition with... some more adult leagues on the Dillboy field. But as you know, their fields are very high commodity. I&#39;ll speak on that. That&#39;s your expertise.</td>

But I would say the majority of the new openings have still been used by the same groups. I feel like the high school... has maintained the same amount of hours that they&#39;ve had at billboard while using Revis youth soccer still uses roughly the same hours they were using before at billboard while using Revis. Um, I think it&#39;s something that we can circle back on and see how effectively they&#39;re actually using the fields and see if there&#39;s an opportunity to, to move them around. But Revis opened and a lot of the scheduling at billboard has remained pretty much the same for those groups.</td>

I guess I was assuming, given the much higher cost of Dillboy for someone like youth soccer to rent, that it would... They would want to move, but maybe they had to use Dillboy just because of numbers. So, okay, that&#39;s interesting. I appreciate you letting me go deep on Dillboy fee revenues here. Colleagues, anything else on the enterprise funds? That includes Jenny Smith or Sanders Pool. Actually, I got a follow-up question on my Jenny Smith or Sanders Pool question. Those retained earnings, I mean, that&#39;s basically... saving us from doing another, you know, equal, you know, well, I guess it wouldn&#39;t be equal for another really large subsidy out of general fund this year.

Yeah, I think we, what we&#39;re, what we&#39;re trying to balance is, you know, do we raise, revenue or do we utilize the resources that we have available to us this year for a number of reasons, mostly due to our initial sort of startup costs of the Jenny Smithers pool rolling over year to year. To my understanding, we have this balance, so we&#39;re going to use it. You know, that&#39;s $373,000 we otherwise would have had to reduce from the general fund budget. So, you know, this is an important community resource. We want to see how things go. And we also expect program revenue to continue to increase from usage and however that moves along.</td>

Um, thank you for your work for the ads, you know, I guess like everything about your stuff, it&#39;s like, there&#39;s no change, but I could not, I almost, I should have probably sent you like a letter note just, but I guess I&#39;m just curious about, uh, the only little surprise that I saw, you know, uh, for this fiscal budget, it&#39;s, uh, is that I know you&#39;re taking greater responsibility with the art of the armory. So I wasn&#39;t sure where the extra money that will be needed to cover the operation, like where it will be coming from. So I don&#39;t see that. Give me some juice there.</td>

                <td>OK, through the chair. As I think many of you know, and especially in the community, that the city&#39;s been going through probably a three-year master plan process with the armory. We just recently released the master plan. We&#39;re getting ready to work on the RFP process to lease spaces out that are leasable spaces in the armory. Based on the pro forma that we&#39;re working on, currently we&#39;re looking at Absolutely. I think a little bit of the discussion that happened in the prior department, we&#39;re looking at how we can basically have a fee structure that comes in that will provide sustainability to the building and to the operations of that. But yet at the same time, have it be sort of equitable and fair to the community. And I think we&#39;re going to hear more about it this summer. We&#39;re having community meetings about this. It will be in the RFP process. But you&#39;re absolutely right. There&#39;s no specific 01 line item to support the armory. I will say the other thing about this and people in the public and community should know that the whole benefit of the city owning and maintaining operations of the armory, as it relates to like an economy of scale, meaning that DPW is there two hours a night. The Arts Council is there supporting some programming. OSPCD is doing this. So at this point, we&#39;ve got about six different departments that are working on supporting the armory as a building. And then what we&#39;re looking at is the economy of scale of how we can continue that. And then how can potential rents coming in further support that? So at this time for FY26, there&#39;s no additional low one request.</td>

I want to make sure that, you know, what I&#39;m seeing is making sense because I&#39;m seeing just the... Let me open like some shit. Let me open something first. Because I would think that by now we have, I thought that dev service would be more, not this small amount. So among all the numbers I was looking at, I could not understand why a dev service is this small, given all what is going on. So that&#39;s it. First, there&#39;s like a small, minor increase in our in-depth service, you know, which implies that there&#39;s like very little new borrowing for capital projects for this current year. So, and I&#39;m wondering, you know, if this idea is consistent with the anticipated capital projects that the city has promised to pursue.</td>

                <td>Sure, Mr. Chair, through you. Councilor Bayh, our debt service for fiscal 26 is budgeted at $22.6 million. Avid season budget watchers will know that our target for debt service is, the bond ratings have a target of debt service to general fund revenue of 10%. Our preferred metric is 8% or lower. And you will notice an approximately $900,000 increase from Fiscal 25 original budget to Fiscal 26. The projects that we borrowed in May were the Somerville Ave streetscape, some recurring street resurfacing, Union Square Plaza streetscape and design, Spring Hill sewer, Clarendon Hills infrastructure improvement, Assembly Square fire fit out, Edgerly building improvements, a fire pumper, and the 217th Somerville Ave park. What you&#39;re not seeing in here is we have a strategy as a city to manage our debt service through a number of ways. One of those is trying to reduce the amount that we borrow. So there is a paired appropriation from pre-cash, right? From stabilization funds, $4.7 million for this year that finance director Ed Bean, who if you couldn&#39;t guess is off camera over here, We are netting down the amount of principal that we&#39;re borrowing by that $4.6 million for this year. So that strategy will save us $400,000 in debt service next year and $9.6 million of debt service over the 20-year period, which we would have borrowed that. We pay for our capital projects using a variety of tools. What you see here is the debt service piece. There are other pieces, of course, it&#39;s CPA, it&#39;s stabilization funds, it&#39;s pay go capital. So just wanted to use that as an opportunity to kind of talk through by this number, I&#39;m happy that it feels small, $22.6 million, but we do have a great need for many capital projects and a difficult, uncertain revenue future.</td>

So that&#39;s why I was like, hmm, like if all these listed projects were started and financing undertaken, then we expect an added debt service of about, you know, if you multiply like the interest rate by say 6%, that would almost be like $10 million, right? you know, as a total of 190 million times, like whatever fraction, interest and principal repayment per year. So that&#39;s why I was like, it did not make sense to me. And... Hmm.</td>
