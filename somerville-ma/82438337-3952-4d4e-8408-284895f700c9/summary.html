<li>Superintendent Matt Sano stated ISD is exploring options for proactive identification, acknowledging current software is more reactive.</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Vacant Properties Ordinance:</strong><ul>
<li>Councilor Scott asked about the enforcement of the vacant properties ordinance, noting its absence in the departmental memo.</li>
<li>Superintendent Sano indicated that staff allocation would need to be reviewed and suggested discussions on potential updates to the ordinance to make it more enforceable for ISD.</li>

</ul>
</li>

<li>Councilor Burnley asked why the budget for in-state conferences was exceeded.</li>
<li>City Clerk Kimberly Wells explained that more counselors attended the Mass Municipal Association Conference than in previous years, leading to the overage. The FY2026 budget has been increased to reflect this.</li>
</ul>
</li>

</li>
<li><strong>Judgments and Settlements:</strong><ul>
<li>Councilor Mbah questioned the discrepancy in numbers for judgments and settlements, specifically regarding the $60 million payment for 90 Washington Street and the FY2026 budgeted amount.</li>
<li>Budget Director Mike Mastroboni clarified that the $60 million settlement for 90 Washington Street was a supplemental appropriation in FY2025.

</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Printing and Stationery:</strong><ul>
<li>Councilor Burnley inquired about a $7,000 increase in printing and stationery.</li>

</li>
<li><strong>Benefit Expenditures:</strong><ul>

<h4 id="r-parks-and-recreation">R. Parks and Recreation</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Budget Changes:</strong><ul>
<li>Councilor Mbah noted minimal changes in salary and O&amp;M for Parks and Recreation and inquired if the budget contained all required funds for recreation programs and staffing.</li>
<li>Director Sue Yerkes confirmed that the budget includes all required funds. She explained that a deeper look into each account line resulted in more accurate individual line increases, even if the overall budget increase was modest (approximately 3%).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Enterprise Funds (Dillboy, Jenny Smith, Sanders Pool):</strong><ul>
<li>Councilor Mbah asked about projections for revenues and costs for enterprise funds. Director Yerkes stated that the department views itself as providing services rather than being a moneymaker, and they are partnering with the finance team to review the revenue structure.</li>
<li>Chair Wilson followed up on Dillboy field permit fees, noting expected revenues of approximately $150,000, similar to the previous year. He inquired if the opening of Rivas Field had led to a decrease in permitted hours at Dillboy. Director of Operations Yanni Taragades stated that both Revis and Dillboy were permitted equally during a transition period, and high school and youth soccer usage at Dillboy remained similar despite Revis's opening.</li>
<li>Chair Wilson asked about the future of retained earnings for Jenny Smith and Sanders Pool, noting a $373,000 balance used this year. Budget Director Mike Mastroboni stated that while they aim to manage costs, an increase in the general fund subsidy is likely next year unless program revenue significantly increases.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Capital Projects and Future Operating Costs:</strong><ul>
<li>Councilor Mbah asked about the department's ability to carry forward capital projects listed in the CIP, given the current budget.</li>
<li>Budget Director Mike Mastroboni explained that the city's capital planning is at a "turning point" due to starkly different revenue projections. He stated that the next CIP would be "less ambitious and more realistic," focusing on maintaining core services and existing assets rather than expanding them, similar to the general fund budget. He also mentioned the use of alternative funding sources like ARPA and stabilization funds to manage debt.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Motions:</strong> No motions were made regarding Parks and Recreation or its Enterprise Funds.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="s-arts-council">S. Arts Council</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Armory Operations:</strong><ul>
<li>Councilor Mbah inquired about the funding for the Arts Council's increased responsibility with the Armory, noting a lack of specific line items.</li>
<li>Director Gregory Jenkins explained that the city is developing an RFP process to lease spaces in the Armory, with a pro forma aiming for a fee structure that provides sustainability while being equitable. He noted that multiple departments (DPW, Arts Council, OSPCD) are already supporting the Armory, creating an economy of scale. No additional "01" (salary) request is made for FY2026.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Motions:</strong> No motions were made regarding the Arts Council.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="iv-non-departmental-items">IV. Non-Departmental Items</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Items Reviewed:</strong> Salary Contingency, Revolving Funds, PAYGO, Debt Service, Unemployment Compensation, Pension, and State Assessments.</li>
<li><strong>Debt Service:</strong><ul>
<li>Councilor Mbah questioned the relatively small increase in debt service despite numerous capital projects.</li>
<li>Budget Director Mike Mastroboni stated that FY2026 debt service is budgeted at $22.6 million, an increase of approximately $900,000 from FY2025. He explained that the city manages debt through strategies like reducing borrowing (e.g., $4.7 million from stabilization funds this year, saving $400,000 in debt service next year and $9.6 million over 20 years). He also noted that projects from the past are continually paid off, and new borrowing is added, leading to annual adjustments.</li>
<li>Mastroboni confirmed that the city will be slowing down the pace of capital projects due to revenue uncertainty, economic uncertainty, rising interest rates, and contractor availability.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Motions:</strong> No questions or motions were made regarding non-departmental items.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="v-adjournment">V. Adjournment</h3>
<ul>
<li>Chair Wilson asked if any departments needed to be called back for additional questions on Monday night. No counselors indicated a need.</li>
<li>Budget Director Mike Mastroboni encouraged counselors to email IGA with any questions for "cut night" to ensure productive discussions.</li>
<li>Councilor Mbah moved to adjourn the meeting.</li>
<li><strong>Roll Call on Adjournment (7:52 p.m.):</strong><ul>
<li>Councilor Mbah: Yes</li>
<li>Councilor Burnley: Aye</li>
<li>Councilor Clingan: Yes</li>

</ul>
</li>
