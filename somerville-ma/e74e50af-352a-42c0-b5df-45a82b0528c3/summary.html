<h3 id="3-discussion-on-double-poles-and-overhead-service-providers-id-24-1777">3. Discussion on Double Poles and Overhead Service Providers (ID 24-1777)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Origin:</strong> This item was introduced by Councilor J.T. Scott to address long-standing concerns about double poles in the city.</li>
<li><strong>Attendees from Service Providers:</strong><ul>
<li>Jackie Duffy, Eversource</li>
<li>Jason Wright, Community Relations at Eversource</li>
<li>Angela Holm-Barson, Government Affairs for Comcast</li>
<li>Ellen Cummings, Regional Director of State Government Affairs for Verizon</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Discussion Points:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Definition of "Engines":</strong> Jason Wright (Eversource) explained "Engines" (National Joint Utility Notification System) as an online tool where utilities submit "tickets" for double pole surveys. The system tracks transfers of primary and secondary attachments, indicating which utility is "next to go" (NTG) to move their equipment. Once all attachments are moved, Eversource removes the old pole.</li>
<li><strong>List of Double Poles:</strong> Ellen Cummings (Verizon) confirmed that the provided four-page list, which she pulled from Engines that morning, accurately indicates all 110 double poles currently in the city and their "next to go" status. She clarified that "NST" (NSTAR) refers to Eversource. "NPSL" (Non-Participating) indicates entities not registered in Engines, which require further investigation to identify.</li>
<li><strong>Progress on Removals:</strong> Jason Wright (Eversource) estimated that approximately a dozen poles have been removed from a prior list. Currently, there are about 6 pending transfers (Eversource is next to move) and 7-10 pole removals pending. The timeframe for removal can vary from months to years.</li>
<li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> All utility representatives emphasized their collaborative efforts with the city and each other to address double poles, especially for priority poles (e.g., at busy intersections or safety hazards).</li>
<li><strong>Request for Reporting:</strong> Councilor Davis requested a periodic report (e.g., semi-annually) detailing progress on double pole removals, including a list of completed tickets and a glossary of acronyms used in the Engines system. This would enhance transparency and demonstrate progress to the public.</li>
<li><strong>Verizon's Role:</strong> Ellen Cummings (Verizon) stated that Verizon is typically the last to move and remove the pole. Currently, there are no double poles where Verizon is "next to go." She offered to provide the list and a glossary of acronyms to the Clerk.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Committee Action:</strong> The committee decided to keep this item in committee for future follow-up discussions, likely at the end of the year or beginning of next year, to monitor progress on double pole removals.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="4-update-on-closed-captioning-ordinance-outreach-id-24-0107">4. Update on Closed Captioning Ordinance Outreach (ID 24-0107)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Origin:</strong> This item was introduced by Councilor Willie Burnley, Jr.</li>
<li><strong>Presenter:</strong> Director of Economic Development</li>
<li><strong>Update Summary:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Limited Outreach:</strong> The Economic Development Department has conducted minimal outreach beyond licensing staff sending information to licensed restaurants about the ordinance change.</li>
<li><strong>"Carrot vs. Stick" Dilemma:</strong> The Director explained that the Economic Development Department's role is to provide resources and support ("carrots"), not enforcement ("sticks"). Since the ordinance lacks an explicit enforcement mechanism and the department is not the enforcement agent, broad outreach is challenging.</li>
<li><strong>Business Community Anxiety:</strong> The current political climate, particularly federal immigration enforcement, has heightened anxiety among small business owners. City staff approaching businesses are sometimes perceived with fear, potentially eroding trust. This makes it difficult to introduce new regulations like the closed captioning ordinance without appearing as an additional burden or scrutiny.</li>
<li><strong>Case-by-Case Approach:</strong> The department's current strategy is to assist on a case-by-case basis if a complaint is filed or a request is made, helping businesses understand how to implement closed captioning.</li>
<li><strong>Commission for Persons with Disabilities:</strong> The department has not had recent conversations with the Commission for Persons with Disabilities regarding this ordinance since its drafting.</li>
<li><strong>Licensing Department's Role:</strong> Michael Pottier (Licensing Operations Manager) confirmed that an email was sent to all licensees on December 28, 2023, before the ordinance went into effect. New licensees are expected to familiarize themselves with local laws. A mechanism for complaints exists on the Licensing Commission website, but no complaints have been filed since 2023.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Comments:</strong><ul>
<li>Councilor Davis reiterated that the ordinance is a "soft touch," simply requiring businesses with televisions capable of closed captioning to turn it on. He emphasized its importance for accessibility.</li>
<li>Chair Burnley acknowledged the challenges but stressed the importance of the law. He suggested exploring other city departments or stakeholders for outreach and noted that many people are unaware of complaint mechanisms like 311. He emphasized the need for a balanced approach that ensures laws are meaningful without being overly burdensome.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Committee Action:</strong> The Clerk was instructed to mark this item as "work complete" for now, acknowledging the update provided.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="adjournment">Adjournment</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Motion:</strong> Councilor Pineda-Newfeld moved to adjourn the meeting.</li>
<li><strong>Vote:</strong><ul>
<li>Councilor Davis: Yes</li>
<li>Councilor Pineda-Newfeld: Yes</li>
<li>Chair Burnley: Aye</li>
<li><strong>Outcome:</strong> The motion passed with 3 votes in favor, 0 opposed, and 0 abstentions. The meeting was adjourned.</li>
