<h3 id="3-44-white-street-waiver-request">3. 44 White Street - Waiver Request</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Applicant:</strong> Attorney Ann Vigorito (representing the applicant), Stephen Serragusa (Bowman Consulting), Greg Hennepin (Mobility Division)</li>
<li><strong>Project Description:</strong> Request for a waiver for a Transportation Impact Fee (TIF) report for a three-unit residential project in the MR-4 district, a transit area. The project seeks a special permit for parking relief to exceed the maximum allowed number of vehicle parking spaces (0.5 spaces per dwelling unit, resulting in 1.5 allowed, but ISD determined 1 space allowed).</li>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li>Stephen Serragusa presented the waiver request, noting a submitted parking utilization study and memo.</li>
<li>Greg Hennepin (Mobility Division) stated that a parking utilization study of the surrounding area is not relevant for this project because residents are not eligible for on-street parking permits. The Mobility Division supported the waiver request.</li>
<li>Board members noted that both the applicant and city staff were in agreement on the waiver.</li>
<li>Chair Capuano expressed support for waiving the requirement as the city did not believe it was needed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Action:</strong> The Chair moved to waive the requirement for a TIF report for 44 White Street.</li>

<h3 id="4-199-elm-street-continuance-from-previous-meeting">4. 199 Elm Street - Continuance from Previous Meeting</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Applicant:</strong> Pablo Picker (Developer), Paul Miller (Principal Architect, Neighbor Architects), Curtis (Landscape Architect)</li>
<li><strong>Project Description:</strong> Proposed four-story building with ground-floor commercial space and three floors of residential apartments (mix of unit sizes) on an MR-4 parcel near Davis Square. The design aims to preserve a mural on the neighboring Cafe Revival and includes stepping setbacks to create an entry courtyard and balconies.</li>
<li><strong>Updates from Applicant:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Public Art/Mural:</strong> The applicant presented Option 1, which includes a mural on the stair tower, integrating it with the architecture. They met with a local muralist and confirmed the mural would wrap around to the north side of the building as well.</li>
<li><strong>Building Articulation:</strong> Three options for cornice design were presented. Option 1, the preferred option, featured two rows of soldier course brick and an aluminum drip cap, with precast concrete lintels over windows. Options 2 and 3 offered more distinct cornices.</li>
<li><strong>Unit Mix:</strong> The applicant reiterated the challenges of incorporating three-bedroom units due to building width and staircase requirements, resulting in "generous two-bedroom units."</li>
<li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> All units will be Group 1 accessible. The applicant explained the difficulty of incorporating Group 2 accessibility for a small building (under 20 units), citing increased bathroom sizes, modifiable kitchens, and spatial challenges.</li>
<li><strong>Vault in Front:</strong> The applicant confirmed that engineers did not anticipate issues with the below-grade vault.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Board Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Mural:</strong> Member Richards praised the mural integration and requested a mural on the north side, which the applicant agreed to.</li>
<li><strong>Design Options:</strong><ul>
<li>Chair Capuano expressed a preference for Options 2 or 3, finding Option 1 "naked" at the top.</li>
<li>Member Richards preferred Option 1, appreciating the subtlety and continuity of articulation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Unit Mix &amp; Accessibility:</strong><ul>
<li>Member McNeely expressed disappointment about the lack of three-bedroom units but appreciated the two-bedroom mix. He urged the applicant to consider more creative solutions for accessible units, particularly making them affordable, noting the financial burden on individuals for modifications.</li>
<li>The applicant clarified that Group 2 accessibility is typically triggered at 20 units and presents significant challenges for a smaller project.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Vault/Transformer:</strong><ul>
<li>Member McNeely raised concerns about the transformer vault, suggesting an amendment that if the transformer could not be underground, the project should return to the Board for review.</li>
<li>Staff (Kit Luster) clarified that such a change would trigger a plan revision, which staff would determine as a major or de minimis amendment.</li>
<li>Chair Capuano suggested that if the transformer could not be underground, it would not be considered a de minimis change, ensuring Board review. The applicant stated their intent to keep it underground.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>General Support:</strong> Board members expressed overall support for the project, acknowledging the applicant's responsiveness to previous comments.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Action:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Resolution 1: Site Plan Approval</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Motion:</strong> To approve the site plan approval to develop a general building in the district, with conditions as outlined in the staff memorandum and discussed by the Planning Board.</li>
<li><strong>Motion by:</strong> Chair Capuano</li>

<li><strong>Motion by:</strong> Chair Capuano</li>

<h3 id="5-74-middlesex-special-permit-for-non-conforming-wall-signs">5. 74 Middlesex - Special Permit for Non-Conforming Wall Signs</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Applicant:</strong> Charles Spivey (Graystar Asset Management), Darren Baird, Anthony Galluccio (Council)</li>
<li><strong>Project Description:</strong> 74M Property Owner LLC seeks a special permit for non-conforming wall signs in the Assembly Square Mixed Use District (ASMD) per SCO 7.4.9.B. The signs, "74M" within a 5-foot diameter circle, are located above the north, south, and west entry doors of a 15-story, 525,000 sq ft lab office building.</li>
<li><strong>Public Hearing Notice:</strong> "74 Middlesex Avenue, 74M property owner LLC seeks to install nonconforming wall signs in the Assembly Square Mixed Use District, ASMD, per SCO 7.4.9.B, which requires a special permit, ZP25-000076."</li>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li>Darren Baird explained that the signs are property identification/wayfinding, not tenant-driven, and were installed under the belief they were not "signs" requiring a permit. ISD flagged them, leading to this application.</li>
<li><strong>Non-Conformities:</strong><ul>
<li>Wall signs are for address identification, not ground-story business.</li>
<li>Adhered to glass curtain wall, not permitted for architectural elements.</li>
<li>Provide property information, not business name/logo.</li>
<li>Located at three entrances (only one per tenant allowed, two for corner tenants).</li>
<li>Diameter of 5 feet exceeds the 4-foot maximum height for wall signs under 10.8.11a.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Staff (Steve Carey) confirmed that the signs are already installed and that the primary staff recommendation was to reduce the sign diameter from 5 feet to 4 feet to align with the ordinance.</li>
<li><strong>Board Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li>Member Schuster confirmed the signs were already installed.</li>
<li>The applicant stated that reducing the circle size would require significant rework due to backlighting hardware.</li>
<li>Chair Capuano and Member Richards felt that requiring a reduction from 5 feet to 4 feet was "silly" given the minor difference and the existing installation. They suggested it might have been a de minimis change.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Public Testimony:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>In Support:</strong> None.</li>
<li><strong>In Opposition/Concern:</strong> None.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Action:</strong> The Chair moved to approve the special permit, modifying the staff recommendation to allow the 5-foot diameter circle to remain as installed.</li>
<li><strong>Vote:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Motion by:</strong> Chair Capuano</li>
<li><strong>Seconded by:</strong> Vice Chair Habib</li>
<li><strong>Roll Call:</strong><ul>
<li>Jahan Habib: Aye</li>
<li>Michael McNeely: Aye</li>
<li>Lynn Richards: Aye</li>
<li>Luke Schuster: Aye</li>

<h3 id="6-3-craigie-street-675-somerville-avenue-site-plan-approval-special-permit">6. 3 Craigie Street / 675 Somerville Avenue - Site Plan Approval &amp; Special Permit</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Applicant:</strong> Attorney Adam Dash, Alexander Varelis (675 Somerville LLC), Sylvia Sheldahl (BOS Urban Architecture), Paxton Sheldahl (BOS Urban Architecture), Christian Ammonia (Offshoots - Landscape Architecture), Krista Lucas (Howard Stein Hudson - Traffic Engineers)</li>
<li><strong>Project Description:</strong> Proposed redevelopment of a former gas station and auto body shop at the corner of 675 Somerville Avenue and 3 Craigie Street. The project involves demolishing existing structures and constructing a new three-story, 14-unit building with ground-floor commercial space. No car parking is proposed or required.</li>
<li><strong>Public Hearing Notice:</strong> "3 Craigie Street / 675 Somerville Avenue, 675 Somerville LLC seeks to develop a general building in the MR-3 zoning district which requires a site plan approval ZP25-000016. 675 Somerville LLC seeks to establish a residential housing use in the MR-3 zoning district which requires a special permit ZP25-000017."</li>
<li><strong>Key Project Features:</strong><ul>
<li>Three-story, all-electric, mixed-use general building.</li>
<li>14 rental units: 5 one-bedroom, 7 two-bedroom, 2 studios.</li>
<li>Two units designated as affordable (specific mix to be discussed with Housing Division).</li>
<li>Two ground-floor units are ADA accessible (Tier 1 and Tier 2).</li>
<li>No motor vehicle parking; all existing curb cuts to be filled.</li>
<li>Exceeds minimum bike parking requirements: 14 covered/secured resident spaces, 6 visitor spaces.</li>
<li>Sustainability: HERS certification, pollinator-safe planting, green roof, removal of automotive use.</li>
<li>Sound attenuation: Triple-pane glazing in bedrooms (STC 37) to mitigate noise from car wash (60 dB) and commuter rail (85 dB).</li>
<li>Materials: Face brick in copper tone with jade and coral fiber cement panel accents.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Pre-Public Testimony Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li>Member McNeely inquired about the removal of underground storage tanks from the former gas station.</li>
<li>Alexander Varelis confirmed tanks were removed in 2018 with an LSP, and soil samples were clean. A report is available.</li>
<li>Member Richards questioned the use of "pollutant-soaking" plants if the soil was clean. Christian Ammonia (Offshoots) explained it's a proactive measure for urban environments, addressing airborne pollutants and general groundwater quality, not just site-specific remediation.</li>
<li>Christian Ammonia also confirmed permeable pavers and stone paving would be used to infiltrate water on site.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Public Testimony:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>In Support:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Crystal Hough (Ward 5):</strong> Supports the project, especially the removal of the parking lot and addition of housing. Appreciates the native plantings and lack of concern about trash/sound. Suggested making at least one accessible unit affordable and consulting a wheelchair user/bicyclist for adaptive bike parking options.</li>
<li><strong>Lisa Bedford (1012 Ibbotson):</strong> Loves the design and believes it's a great upgrade for the neighborhood.</li>
<li><strong>Aaron Webber (32 Summit Avenue):</strong> Supports the project as a transit-oriented, low-parking, modest-sized development from a local family, aligning with city goals to emphasize such projects.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>In Opposition/Concern:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Kenneth Lightner (representing abutters at 669 Somerville Avenue):</strong> Expressed concern about the impact on his clients' property (east of the project). Concerns included loss of light/airflow, lack of landscaping buffer in the alleyway, and the location of trash/recycling bins closest to their building. Also raised questions about snow removal and water prevention. Argued that the burden of trash, traffic, bicycles, and potential deliveries would fall disproportionately on his clients.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Board Discussion (Post-Public Testimony):</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Trash Management:</strong><ul>
<li>Chair Capuano and Member Richards raised concerns about trash location, especially given abutter comments.</li>
<li>Paxton Sheldahl clarified that the main trash is <em>inside</em> the building, near the bike parking. Recycling bins (6 total) are in a smaller, enclosed, and covered area at the back, not directly against the abutter's building. They are exploring "rat-proof and rust-proof" systems like Citibin.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Mobility/Ride Share/Loading:</strong><ul>
<li>Member Richards and Chair Capuano expressed concern about potential increased ride-share (Uber/Lyft) drop-offs and commercial loading, especially with no on-site parking and a bike lane on Somerville Avenue.</li>
<li>Krista Lucas (Howard Stein Hudson) explained that the city will retain control of curb cuts for metered parking. Some meters will be designated for loading/pickup (8 AM - 12 PM). Additional residential permit parking will be added on Craigie Street.</li>
<li>Chair Capuano confirmed that the usual condition of no residential parking stickers for residents would apply (Mobility Condition #5).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Commercial Space:</strong> Chair Capuano asked about the planned use for the commercial space. Alexander Varelis stated no tenant was secured yet but anticipated professional services or similar, not a cafe due to existing options.</li>
<li><strong>Building Materials:</strong> Chair Capuano inquired about the "face brick" and whether it was a veneer. Paxton Sheldahl clarified it is a "full brick" (three and five-eighths inch by two and a quarter inch by seven and five-eighths inch) used in a curtain wall construction, chosen for longevity and low maintenance.</li>
<li><strong>Unit Mix &amp; Affordability:</strong><ul>
<li>Member McNeely reiterated concerns about unit diversity, specifically the lack of three-bedroom units and the potential for accessible units to also be affordable.</li>
<li>Paxton Sheldahl explained that the unit mix (two-bedroom focus) was discussed with UDC, aligning with "general building" typology for smaller households. He noted that the walk-up design (under 20 units, no elevator) helps drive down rental costs, aiming for "below market rate rent."</li>
<li>Member McNeely found the answers on affordability and accessibility "not the best," urging more creativity to improve housing stock diversity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>General Support:</strong> Member Schuster praised the project's thoughtful details and its potential to add vibrancy and a better neighborhood feel to the Somerville Avenue stretch.</li>
<li><strong>Energy Conservation:</strong> Vice Chair Habib asked about energy conservation beyond being all-electric. Paxton Sheldahl highlighted passive strategies: cross-ventilation from north/south exposure (due to walk-up typology), and balcony design for solar heat gain in winter and shading in summer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Action:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Written Comment Period:</strong> Extended until August 29, 2025, at 9:00 AM (planningboard@somervillema.gov).</li>
<li><strong>Continuance:</strong> The Chair moved to continue this agenda item to the next meeting on September 4, 2025, at 6:00 PM, to allow for further discussion, particularly on the unit mix.</li>
