<h3 id="4-44-white-street-waiver-request">4. 44 White Street - Waiver Request</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Applicant Presentation:</strong><ul>
<li>Attorney Stephen Serragusa, Bowman Consulting, on behalf of the applicant, presented a request for a waiver of the Transportation Impact Fee (TIF) report.</li>
<li>The project is a three-unit residential building in the MR-4 district, a transit area.</li>
<li>Zoning allows 0.5 vehicle parking spaces per dwelling unit, meaning 1.5 spaces, with the ISD determining one space is allowed.</li>
<li>A TIF report, typically a parking utilization study, is usually required for special permit applications to exceed parking maximums.</li>
<li>The applicant argued that a parking utilization study of the surrounding area is irrelevant because residents are not eligible for on-street parking permits.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Staff Comments:</strong><ul>
<li>Greg Hennepin, Transportation Planner in the Mobility Division, confirmed discussions with the applicant.</li>
<li>The Mobility Division supports the waiver request, as a TIF report is not deemed relevant given the transit-oriented location and the ineligibility of residents for on-street parking permits.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Board Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li>Chair Capuano noted that both the applicant and staff were in agreement regarding the waiver.</li>
<li>Michael McNeely inquired about the nature of the waiver, clarifying it was for a requirement to submit something to the city to proceed to the next step, not for the special permit itself.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Action:</strong> The Chair moved to waive the requirement for a TIF report for 44 White Street.</li>
<li><strong>Motion:</strong> Moved by Chair Capuano, seconded by Jahan Habib.</li>
<li><strong>Vote:</strong><ul>
<li>Jahan Habib: Aye</li>
<li>Michael McNeely: Aye</li>
<li>Lynn Richards: Aye</li>
<li>Luc Schuster: Aye</li>
<li>Michael Capuano: Aye</li>

<h3 id="5-199-elm-street-continuance-from-previous-meeting">5. 199 Elm Street - Continuance from Previous Meeting</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Applicant Presentation:</strong><ul>
<li>Pablo Picker (Developer) and Paul Miller (Principal Architect, Neighbor Architects) presented updates in response to previous Board comments.</li>
<li><strong>Project Overview:</strong> Four-story building in MR-4 district near Davis Square, with ground-floor commercial space and three floors of residential apartments.</li>
<li><strong>Design Updates:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Public Art/Mural:</strong> The applicant proposed a mural on the stair tower, integrating it with the architecture. They confirmed discussions with a local muralist and expressed willingness to add a mural to the other large blank wall on the north side of the building as a condition.</li>
<li><strong>Building Articulation:</strong> Three options for cornice design were presented. Option 1, the preferred choice, featured two rows of soldier course brick and an aluminum drip cap, with precast concrete lintels over windows.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Unit Mix:</strong> Michael McNeely inquired about increasing the number of bedrooms and incorporating more accessibility features.<ul>
<li>The applicant stated that increasing to three-bedroom units was challenging due to building width and staircase requirements, leading to impractically large units.</li>
<li>All units are designed to be Group 1 accessible. Group 2 accessibility (requiring larger bathrooms, modifiable kitchens, zero-threshold balconies) was deemed difficult for a small building (under 20 units, where Group 2 is typically triggered).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Vault in Front:</strong> Michael McNeely raised concerns about the underground transformer vault and its potential impact if it needed to be brought above ground.<ul>
<li>The applicant stated engineers did not anticipate issues.</li>
<li>Staff (Kit Luster) clarified that if the transformer could not be underground, it would trigger a plan revision, and the Board determined this would not be a <em>de minimis</em> change, requiring Board review.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Board Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li>Lynn Richards praised the mural integration and the blue railing design. She expressed a preference for Option 1 for the cornice, citing its subtlety and flow with the building's articulation.</li>
<li>Michael McNeely appreciated the design options and the applicant's responsiveness. He reiterated concerns about unit diversity and the potential for accessible units to also be affordable. He also emphasized the importance of the transformer vault issue.</li>
<li>Luc Schuster noted his support for the project and the careful consideration of details.</li>
<li>Chair Capuano expressed a personal preference for Options 2 or 3 for the cornice, believing they offered more definition, but acknowledged the applicant's preference for Option 1. He also clarified that the brick used would be full brick, not thin brick veneer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Action 1 (Site Plan Approval):</strong> Following public testimony, review of submitted materials, and deliberation of required considerations, the Board moved to approve the site plan with conditions outlined in the staff memorandum and discussed by the Planning Board.<ul>
<li><strong>Motion:</strong> Moved by Chair Capuano, seconded by Jahan Habib.</li>
<li><strong>Vote:</strong><ul>
<li>Jahan Habib: Aye</li>
<li>Michael McNeely: Aye</li>
<li>Lynn Richards: Aye</li>
<li>Luc Schuster: Aye</li>
<li>Michael Capuano: Aye</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Outcome:</strong> Motion passed unanimously (5-0).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Action 2 (Special Permit for Residential Housing Use):</strong> Following public testimony, review of submitted materials, and deliberation of required considerations and findings, the Board moved to approve the request to establish a residential housing use in the MR-4 zoning district with conditions in the staff memorandum and as discussed by the Planning Board.<ul>
<li><strong>Motion:</strong> Moved by Chair Capuano, seconded by Jahan Habib.</li>
<li><strong>Vote:</strong><ul>
<li>Jahan Habib: Aye</li>
<li>Michael McNeely: Aye</li>
<li>Lynn Richards: Aye</li>
<li>Luc Schuster: Aye</li>
<li>Michael Capuano: Aye</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Outcome:</strong> Motion passed unanimously (5-0).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Action 3 (Special Permit for Mechanical Penthouse Height):</strong> Following public testimony, review of submitted materials, and deliberation of required considerations and findings, the Board moved to approve the request for a mechanical penthouse height exceeding the 10-foot maximum in the district with conditions in the staff memorandum and as discussed by the Planning Board.<ul>
<li><strong>Motion:</strong> Moved by Chair Capuano, seconded by Jahan Habib.</li>
<li><strong>Vote:</strong><ul>
<li>Jahan Habib: Aye</li>

<h3 id="6-74-middlesex-avenue-special-permit-for-non-conforming-wall-signs-zp25-000076">6. 74 Middlesex Avenue - Special Permit for Non-Conforming Wall Signs (ZP25-000076)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Public Hearing Notice:</strong> "74 Middlesex Avenue, 74M Property Owner LLC seeks to install nonconforming wall signs in the Assembly Square Mixed Use District, ASMD, per SCO 7.4.9.B, which requires a special permit, ZP25-000076."</li>
<li><strong>Applicant Presentation:</strong><ul>
<li>Charles Spivey (Greystar) and Darren Baird (Applicant Representative) presented the request for a special permit for building identification signage.</li>
<li>Three signs, identical "74M" in a 5-foot diameter circle, are located above the north, south, and west entry doors.</li>
<li>The signs are already installed. ISD flagged them as requiring relief, as they were initially considered wayfinding, not technical signage.</li>
<li><strong>Non-Conformities:</strong><ul>
<li>Under Article 10.8, wall signs are for address identification, not ground-story business, and these are property identification.</li>
<li>Adhered to glass curtain wall, which is technically not permitted for wall signs.</li>
<li>Provide property information, not a business name or logo.</li>
<li>Located at three separate entrances (each tenant typically allowed one, or two for corner tenants).</li>
<li>Diameter of 5 feet exceeds the maximum 4 feet for wall signs under 10.8.11a.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Staff Comments:</strong><ul>
<li>Steve Carey (Case Planner) confirmed the applicant's understanding that the signs were wayfinding.</li>
<li>Staff's primary recommendation was to reduce the sign diameter from 5 feet to 4 feet to achieve closer compliance with the ordinance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Public Testimony:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>In Support:</strong> Crystal Hough (Ward 5) and Lisa Bedford (1012 Ibbotson) spoke in support, emphasizing the need for housing and the overall positive design. Aaron Webber (32 Summit Avenue) supported the project as a transit-oriented, modest-sized redevelopment by a local family.</li>
<li><strong>In Opposition/Concern:</strong> Kenneth Leitner (representing abutters at 669 Somerville Avenue) expressed concerns about trash location, loss of light/air, snow removal, and water prevention, arguing that the abutters would bear the burden of the project's impacts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Board Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li>Luc Schuster confirmed the signs were already installed and questioned the materiality of reducing the size from 5 feet to 4 feet.</li>
<li>Darren Baird explained that the 5-foot diameter was integral to the design, including backlighting hardware, and reducing it would require significant rework.</li>
<li>Chair Capuano expressed that the difference between 4 and 5 feet was minor and that a smaller sign might look "weird" on the window. He felt the issue was "silly" and should have been <em>de minimis</em>.</li>
<li>Lynn Richards agreed, noting the current underutilization of lab buildings and the need to support tenants.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Action:</strong> Following public testimony, review of submitted materials, and deliberation of required considerations and findings, the Board moved to approve the special permit for non-conforming wall signs, as modified to allow the existing 5-foot diameter circle, rather than the staff-recommended 4-foot diameter.</li>
<li><strong>Motion:</strong> Moved by Chair Capuano, seconded by Jahan Habib.</li>
<li><strong>Vote:</strong><ul>
<li>Jahan Habib: Aye</li>
<li>Michael McNeely: Aye</li>
<li>Lynn Richards: Aye</li>
<li>Luc Schuster: Aye</li>
<li>Michael Capuano: Aye</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Outcome:</strong> Motion passed unanimously (5-0).</li>

<h3 id="7-3-craigie-street-675-somerville-avenue-site-plan-approval-zp25-000016-special-permit-for-residential-housing-use-zp25-000017">7. 3 Craigie Street / 675 Somerville Avenue - Site Plan Approval (ZP25-000016) &amp; Special Permit for Residential Housing Use (ZP25-000017)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Public Hearing Notice:</strong> "3 Craigie Street / 675 Somerville Avenue, 675 Somerville LLC seeks to develop a general building in the MR3 zoning district which requires a site plan approval ZP25-000016. 675 Somerville LLC seeks to establish a residential house use in the MR3 zoning district which requires a special permit ZP25-000017."</li>
<li><strong>Applicant Presentation:</strong><ul>
<li>Attorney Adam Dash, representing 675 Somerville LLC, presented the proposal to demolish existing structures (gas station and auto body shop) and build a new three-story, 14-unit mixed-use building with ground-floor commercial space.</li>
<li>No car parking is proposed or required.</li>
<li><strong>Project Details:</strong><ul>
<li>14 rental units: 5 one-bedroom, 7 two-bedroom, 2 studios.</li>
<li>Two units designated as affordable (specific mix to be determined with Housing Division).</li>
<li>All-electric building, pursuing HERS certification, promoting pollinator-safe planting.</li>
<li><strong>Sustainability:</strong> Removal of current motor vehicle use, infilling existing curb cuts to increase pedestrian safety, green score compliance, cross-ventilation design, green roof.</li>
<li><strong>Site:</strong> Corner lot at Craigie Street and Somerville Avenue, served by two bus lines, within half-mile of Porter Square.</li>
<li><strong>Zoning:</strong> MR3 district, by-right, no variances requested.</li>
<li><strong>Trash Management:</strong> Proposed location on the east side, with screened and covered trash area built into the building and a separate screened/covered recycling area. Applicant clarified that the trash is <em>in</em> the building, not against the abutter's property. They are exploring "rat-proof" systems like Citibin.</li>
<li><strong>Mobility:</strong> Three curb cuts to be closed (one on Craigie, two on Somerville Ave). 14 covered/secured bike spaces for residents, 6 visitor bike spaces.</li>
<li><strong>Noise Mitigation:</strong> Triple-pane glazing in bedroom areas (STC 37) to reduce sound from car wash (60 dB to 2.3 dB) and commuter rail (85 dB to 28 dB). Acoustic design best practices.</li>
<li><strong>Materials:</strong> Face brick (full brick, not veneer) in copper tone with jade and coral fiber cement panel accents.</li>
<li><strong>Underground Storage Tanks:</strong> Alex Varelis confirmed tanks were removed in 2018 with an LSP on site, and soil samples were clean.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Public Testimony:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>In Support:</strong><ul>
<li>Crystal Hough (Ward 5): Supported the project, especially the housing, lack of parking, and accessible units. Suggested one accessible unit be affordable and adaptive bike parking.</li>
<li>Lisa Bedford (1012 Ibbotson): Loved the design, appreciated the incorporation of neighborhood comments, and saw it as a great upgrade.</li>
<li>Aaron Webber (32 Summit Avenue): Supported the project as a transit-oriented, modest-sized redevelopment by a local family, aligning with city goals.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>In Opposition/Concern:</strong><ul>
<li>Kenneth Leitner (representing abutters at 669 Somerville Avenue): Reiterated concerns about trash location (despite applicant's clarification), loss of light/air, lack of landscaping buffer in the alleyway, snow removal plans, and potential water flow issues. Argued abutters would bear disproportionate burden.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Board Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Pollutant-Soaking Plants:</strong> Lynn Richards questioned the selection of pollutant-soaking plants if the soil was clean. Christian (Offshoots) explained it's a proactive measure for urban environments, addressing potential future pollutants from abutting properties and general air/groundwater quality.</li>
<li><strong>Stormwater Management:</strong> Christian confirmed permeable pavers and planting areas on the ground plane to infiltrate water.</li>
<li><strong>Ride Share/Loading:</strong> Lynn Richards and Chair Capuano raised concerns about ride-share pickup/drop-off and commercial loading, especially with no on-site parking and a bike lane on Somerville Avenue.<ul>
<li>Krista Lucas (Howard Stein Hudson) explained that the city would retain control of curb cuts for metered parking. Some meters would be designated for loading/pickup/drop-off between 8 AM and noon. Additional residential permit parking would be added on Craigie Street.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Residential Parking Permits:</strong> Adam Dash confirmed that a condition would prohibit residents from obtaining residential parking permits.</li>
<li><strong>Commercial Space:</strong> Chair Capuano inquired about the planned use for the commercial space. Alex Varelis stated no tenant was secured yet, but it would not be an auto garage. He anticipated professional services or a daycare, not another cafe due to existing options.</li>
<li><strong>Building Energy Source:</strong> Jahan Habib confirmed the building would be all-electric. Paxton Sheldahl (BOS Urban Architecture) highlighted passive strategies like cross-ventilation and balcony shading for energy efficiency.</li>
<li><strong>Unit Mix/Affordability:</strong> Michael McNeely reiterated concerns about unit diversity, specifically the lack of three-bedroom units, and the potential for accessible units to be affordable.<ul>
<li>Paxton Sheldahl explained that the walk-up housing (under 20 units, no elevator) was chosen to drive down costs and keep rents competitive. He noted that the MR3 zone's "general building" type is intended for smaller households (two-bedroom mix), while "apartment building" is for larger households.</li>
<li>Michael McNeely expressed disappointment that the project wasn't doing more for community diversity if it wasn't committing to lower rates or more accessible housing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Continuance:</strong><ul>
<li>Chair Capuano suggested a brief discussion at the next meeting regarding the unit mix, given the concerns raised.</li>
<li><strong>Written Comment Period:</strong> Extended until Friday, August 29, 2025, at 9:00 AM. Comments to be sent to planningboard@somervillema.gov.</li>
<li><strong>Next Meeting:</strong> The public hearing for this agenda item will reconvene on September 4, 2025, at 6:00 PM.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Action:</strong> The Chair moved to continue this agenda item to September 4, 2025.</li>
<li><strong>Motion:</strong> Moved by Chair Capuano, seconded by Jahan Habib.</li>
