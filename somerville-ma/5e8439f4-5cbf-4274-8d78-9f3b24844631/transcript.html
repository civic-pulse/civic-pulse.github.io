This is a project in the Mr. Four district in a transit area, and a half. It&#39;s a residential project, and point five vehicle parking spaces are currently allowed per dwelling unit. It&#39;s a a three unit building. So uh half of three 1.5 so as not to exceed the maximum uh requirements the uh isd has made the termination that one vehicle parking space is what is currently allowed under the zoning ordinance um so typically uh as it&#39;s written in the submittal requirements in order to as part of the special permit application to exceed a parking maximum. A Tis is required, and what we would typically look at in this type of situation is a parking utilization study is usually the the study that we um would request for the surrounding area because this is in a transit area and residents of this building are not eligible for on-street parking permits in this specific case uh The mobility division does not feel that parking utilization study of the surrounding area is relevant to the determination of whether a parking maximum should be exceeded because residents would not be able to utilize that parking under the current zoning regulations. Christopher McConkey, So the mobility division doesn&#39;t feel that there is a transportation study that can be provided as support for exceeding the parking maximum, so we are in support of the applicant requesting their waiver.</td>

This is not the application for the special permit. This is the request to to, to, to wave a certain requirement to submit something to the city in order to get to the next step.

We think we made some good progress and we&#39;re looking forward to sharing those tonight with you in the public so I&#39;m going to pass it off to Paul Miller who&#39;s the principal architect on the project and uh and looking forward to the discussion afterwards thank you thank you thanks Pablo um good evening everyone I&#39;m Paul Miller as Pablo just said</td>

                <td>Christopher McConkey- Perfect Thank you Steve. okay can everyone see my screen okay terrific okay so um just a quick recap um for those who are joining tonight and maybe weren&#39;t at the presentation two weeks ago um the proposed project is a four-story building on an mr4 parcel near davis square in somerville at 199 elm street The proposed project includes a ground floor commercial space and three floors of residential apartments above with a mix of unit sizes. Our design started with the idea of preserving this mural and kind of lot line windows on the neighboring cafe revival and stepping the building back to create a small entry courtyard in the front that would give access both into Christopher McConkey- Our commercial space at 189 LM and also the residential lobby. Christopher McConkey- And then above the building picks up on that stepping idea and steps two more times to create space for. Christopher McConkey- balconies for each of the street facing units, and so the overall kind of design ideas here were a clear kind of base. of the building that picks up on the scale of the context, the neighboring cafe, and there&#39;s a couple other restaurants down Elm Street. And then above this sand or buff colored brick that recalls the kind of brick you see throughout Davis Square. and an oblique view kind of showing the lot line of the building. You can see that we broke the upper massing into three distinct pieces by splitting the building with the stair tower and putting a glazed blue brick on that. And that helps break the scale of the building down into apartment-sized pieces. And so Those design ideas we want to use to inform any other design decisions that we make. In the last meeting, we heard from the board that they would like to see a public art or a mural component on the building, as well as some articulation at the top of the building. So we&#39;re going to show a few different ways of achieving those things today, and then we&#39;ll tell you what our preferred option is. Okay, so here is option one. Christopher McConkey- The same front elevation i&#39;m going to zoom into it to show the details here, so this this for the at the top of the building we&#39;re showing two. Christopher McConkey- rows of soldier course brick and then an aluminum drip CAP and the kind of black accent color you see down at the base and on the balconies and then there&#39;s also a precast concrete lentil over the windows. um and you can see on the stair tower we&#39;re showing a mural this is just a placeholder when the project moves forward we anticipate that we would be working with a muralist we met with a local muralist this past week who did some work at revival and started a conversation so we feel really good about adding this kind of public art component to the project and we feel that the Christopher McConkey- Putting it on the steric tower integrates it really nicely with the architecture and it becomes kind of part of the architectural concept of the of the project. Christopher McConkey- And we also this is going to be our preferred option we like the subtlety of this we like that it the building is still read through its massing. Christopher McConkey- This idea of having these vertical kind of apartment sized pieces across the front of the facade to break it up. this cornice and lintel concept enhances that design idea. We&#39;re going to show you two more ideas just for kind of as a counterpoint. This scheme has a more distinct cornice on the top, shown here in a kind of black aluminum, which again, the color of the balconies and the commercial base And it is that cornice steps along with the massing and is aligned to the sides of each of those vertical upper massing pieces of the project, which is in contrast to this next scheme where the cornice is continuous across all of the upper massing. Christopher McConkey- So this one starts to break apart that reading that we that we want to make sure that we have in the design of those distinct kind of vertical parts of the upper the upper massing. Christopher McConkey- And then here&#39;s those three options next to each other, just for comparison so again, we would like to proceed with option one. Christopher McConkey- And that&#39;s all the way prepared tonight we&#39;re happy to take any questions or comments from the board.</td>

You know, that coming down Russell and that view with the site next door being set back so much, that&#39;s Despite the tree there, we actually had a conversation with the muralist around the tree. It&#39;s not on our site. Obviously, we don&#39;t want to be cutting down trees, and regardless, it&#39;s not our property. But this particular muralist, whether she&#39;s the one that does the project or not, she said, it&#39;s totally fine. We actually looked at shots of the tree in Google Earth when it didn&#39;t have leaves. She said, totally fine. We can integrate something really nicely on that side. We&#39;re in agreement and would be happy with that condition.</td>

So if you want to jump right to explaining as to whether or not we can start including some more accessibility features, I think that would be a more prudent use of time personally.

                <td> Thanks, Michael, for bringing the conversation back to that. So just quickly, in terms of the unit size, we don&#39;t want to spend too much time on it, but just to give context to the approach to the project from the beginning. The very beginning, we had versions of this building with one bedroom and studio. And as a team, we had discussions very early on about, can we get three bedrooms? into this, or can we increase the bedroom count? And it&#39;s just given the width, the two staircases, we would end up essentially with like a 2,700 square foot, three bedroom unit, which just seemed kind of not helpful generally. It seems like way too much space for those types of bedrooms. So these two bedroom units, we, we like put a lot of emphasis as opposed to come in with, you know, more one bedrooms. We kind of said, okay, these are really nice, generous two bedrooms. You know, I have personally, uh, uh, me and my partner have a daughter. Uh, an apartment with two bedrooms is more than enough for like our family. So that was just contextually like the approach to try to make this work, not try to maximize, you know, this kind of development from a financial point of view, um, So bringing it back to the accessibility, I mean, I think that what we discussed as a team is that it starts to get a little bit difficult to make a group two work. If we&#39;re talking about one unit, I know that as a team, we discussed that group two gets triggered at 20 units. And I think at the minimum, it&#39;s 5% of those 20 units. in that kind of bigger development totally makes sense to me to even push that five percent to something bigger in a smaller development with you know with this unit count it starts to feel challenging to make all of those conditions work you know within, for example, if we take the approach of one unit, it feels really challenging and we&#39;ve looked at that. I can let Paul speak more to the architectural and spatial issues, but with regards to the circulation in the bathroom, the kitchen, the balcony going out, the door being zero threshold, it starts to feel tough to take that on on this development. of course, open, you know, to the conversation and push back. But we discussed it and felt like it was kind of too big of a burden on such a low unit count. And given that we did a lot of, you know, put a lot of work to try to make these two bedrooms to cater to, you know, not big families, but families, felt like we were trying to kind of find that balance. Those are my thoughts, but open to... to come, you know, more conversation. And Paul, please feel free to jump on that.</td>

                <td>I&#39;ll just add a little bit. Generally speaking, to change a group one unit to a group two unit, the bathrooms get a little bit bigger and the kitchens have to be modifiable so that you have knee space underneath the sink and the cooktop and the space between the sink and the cooktop. And so, you know, we&#39;re talking about special cabinetry And then the spatial challenge is a tough one on a tight site. Like making one unit have a bigger bathroom means that there could be plumbing transfers and the layouts shift from one floor to the other. And Pablo was starting to hint at this as he was talking. It is difficult to do in a small building, which I think is why the code is written in the way that it is, where that threshold is 20 units where the group two um requirement kicks in um and so yeah i will just highlight again that the building is going to provide group one units um all the for all the units and we also have an elevator going up to the rooftop for the amenities space so that will all be accessible as well And so I think we&#39;re just talking about the level of accessibility here and whether or not the kind of financial cost of upgrading to a group two unit for one unit is, you know, appropriate for this project, given the scale and the tight site.</td>

So thanks for highlighting that. The second thing, Mr. Chair, if you don&#39;t mind me hogging the floor a little bit longer, was to talk a little bit about the vault in the front again. So I know that was a topic that we brought up as a point of concern just because of the water table nearby and wanted to know if you guys have any other comments to add to that discussion at this point.</td>

You guys have said option 1, I will tell you, I am not an architect. I took some design courses in college over at gundall and I was all well and good. And who cares? But I will just tell you, I am not a fan of option 1. I think the top looks kind of naked and as a guy&#39;s lost a lot of his hair look somewhat similar. So, I will be more in favor of options 2 or 3 kind of either 1. the other thing that I&#39;m kind of noticing and I&#39;m wondering Paul, I think this is your screen. Can you bring us back to the. Bigger facades of options 2 and 3. Sure, and do all of them have the piece on top of the window? The articulated piece on top of the windows. They do not. Option one and option three have that. Is there a reason option two didn&#39;t?</td>

But I always liked the idea of having an articulated top of the window, but that&#39;s that&#39;s just me. I personally like either 2 or 3. I think it gives a little bit more definition to the top of the building. If the intent that you all had was to make it a little bit more minimal, I think 2 probably meets that more than 3. So, with, I think what you&#39;re stated. um preference for the design of this building is to be a little bit more minimal um of those two i&#39;d i&#39;d say you know option option two works better for me um in what i would like to see as well as what you think your stated design for the um for the building is but anybody has anything that like that i see yeah thanks like take all the ornamentation away give me a box</td>

I like the articulation of the sandstone above the windows, but I liked the subtlety of the lines up top. It, to me, it carried, the same type of articulation that you see from the from the from the ground up. Like you&#39;ve got that revival. They pulled in the same coloring and the same thickness from revival on that first floor. And then the windows actually are framed with very light and then light, you know, light framing and then at the very top of the articulation kind of carries that through. right so to me it flowed a little better um i can&#39;t even tell you how much i&#39;m in love with the blue railing um and and that design element so for me michael i when they that&#39;s why i didn&#39;t you know i i think this is kind of outside the purview of the planning board you would know that better but to me they liked option we do this all the time but just you know i i don&#39;t want to get too</td>

I think that that, because Chirikopwana, we had as a team also that context of, or this conversation of a cap and kind of a hat on this, something that kind of terminated. But I think like we all kind of followed Paul, this was like Paul&#39;s, Paul put a lot into this from the beginning. And I think we could feel as a team outside of Paul, his reluctance to us driving this kind of cap version, because I think Paul&#39;s vision from the beginning was this kind of this verticality. And so I think the soldier horse kind of has this nice in-between. It kind of creates a little bit of this like, at um you know some termination again it&#39;s to everyone&#39;s opinion but it&#39;s subtle and just speaking with in terms of the windows i think for sure we&#39;re going to have those those stone lintels articulation on the windows i think the other version we talked as a team that we&#39;re going to have this kind of funky metal termination that i think won&#39;t look as good i think that this version Again, wherever we land on the top, but this version of the lentils as a stone or precast is a lot more successful. So, anyways, I just wanted to give that.</td>

It&#39;s located on the north, south, and west building entrances at 74 Middlesex. Darren, if you want to go to the next slide, just give a quick kind of overview of 74M. Yeah, so 74M is a 15-story, 525,000 square foot lab office building located in Assembly Square. The building achieved certificate of occupant, or excuse me, substantial completion in September of 2024. And we are wrapping up final construction in the neighboring civic space currently. So I will turn it over to Darren, who will talk about the request today.</td>

                <td> Great. Thanks, Charles. Good evening, Mr. Chair and members of the planning board. We&#39;ll try to be brief here. So we are here tonight to talk about three specific signage locations on the building that are above the south, north, south and west entry doors on the building. And they are property identification signage. So while they&#39;re wall signs, they don&#39;t technically comply with the wall signage requirements, which are really meant to be tenant driven. and occupant driven right but we think it&#39;s important way finding for the building and so here is just in all three of these signs are exactly or all three of these property identification signs are the same it&#39;s a 74m as shown on the screen here this is above the south entry which faces the kensington avenue civic space which abuts the property and i&#39;ll i&#39;ll zoom out to a site plan that reorients folks i know we&#39;ve been here a couple times but uh you guys see a lot of cases um and so it&#39;s really a 74m with a circle adhered to um you know the glass above the doorways and here&#39;s the south elevation view of it this is also the south here&#39;s the civic space to to plan left is the civic space at kensington and there&#39;s the there&#39;s the signage there above the door on the north side this is along the graph highway same thing you know five foot diameter circle with lettering that says 74m and then on the west side at the bike room entrance um same thing five but you know five foot diameter circle with 74m in the middle as shown graphically on the site plan here&#39;s the building at 74 middlesex here&#39;s the kensington avenue um civic space and the building signs are on the south side here north side here and west side here so here really as as detailed in the staff memo in our application there are a couple of there are a handful of instances of non-conformity first You know, under Article 10.8 of the of the ordinance, the wall signs are really address identification. They&#39;re not for a ground story business. And so that&#39;s technically a way that these wall signs don&#39;t comply with a letter of 10.8. They&#39;re also here to the glass curtain wall above the entry doors. And as a technical matter, wall signs are not supposed to be adhered to windows or any architectural element. They also provide property information and don&#39;t contain a business name or logo, which technically is not permitted under 10.8 for wall signs. And they&#39;re located at the three separate entrances. So each tenant in a building is allowed to have one wall sign, unless they&#39;re a corner tenant, and then they can have two. Here, this isn&#39;t a tenant, right? This is building identification signs. So we technically don&#39;t, aren&#39;t, you know, having signage in connection with a tenant. um and then finally can i ask you a question do you already have signage up the signage is already up and it was installed because we thought it was wayfinding it wasn&#39;t in property identification not technically a sign and so isd pointed out that yes it&#39;s signage and they would like us to come in and try to get you know get relief necessary to be able to maintain it So that&#39;s why we&#39;re here this evening. It was not, you know, had we had we realized it was signage when it was put up, we would have been here first. But now we&#39;re here. So, yes, it is up in all three of those locations. Um, I think last but not least is the diameter of the sign as a technical matter. The you know, the the diameter of the circle that encircles the 74 M lettering is 5 feet instead of 4 feet, which 4 feet is the maximum height of a wall sign under 10.811a of the ordinance. Again, that&#39;s the extent of the circle. The lettering is much smaller than four feet. And so we&#39;re hoping that the lettering is really what the focal point is and not the circle. So that&#39;s what we&#39;re looking for from the standpoint of James Rattling Leafs, Changes I don&#39;t want to see variances but changes from what is otherwise required under 10.8 to be able to maintain the signage. James Rattling Leafs, We think that the signage is very helpful from a way finding perspective and fits with the aesthetics of the building and. James Rattling Leafs, You know, as detailed in the staff memo think that you know all the findings under 15.2.1. for a special permit as well as 7.4.9 are findings that the planning board can make favorably in order to allow for the special permit to be granted. So I really don&#39;t have much else. These are the required findings. I know you guys are familiar with them. They&#39;re outlined in the staff memo. So rather than continue to go on, I guess we&#39;ll open it up to questions from the board. If you guys have any, happy to answer them. And that&#39;s it.</td>

Does anybody else on the board have any comments or questions of the applicant or staff before I open up to testimony? Seeing none, what I&#39;m going to do is I&#39;m going to open up this public hearing to testimony for anybody that wants to speak in support of this application. Please raise your hand, little button, and I&#39;ll call on you. Anybody that wants to speak in support. Going once, going twice. Seeing none, I&#39;m going to close that portion of the public hearing. And open it up to anybody who wants to speak in opposition to the application. Going once going twice. Okay, seeing none, I will bring it back to members of the board. Anybody have anything that they would like to address? I see Luke.</td>

The language in our agenda talks about it as a future thing, but that&#39;s just the sort of legalese of the agenda. And to me, I&#39;m asking because this does feel somewhat material. On the margin, you know, I guess going to four feet would be better, but if it&#39;s already up, it does feel to me like it&#39;s so minor. I don&#39;t have a major concern with it staying.

And we think it&#39;s helpful to assembly in general to have the address identified. So I can&#39;t say we would easily make them smaller if they weren&#39;t affixed, but because they&#39;re not, it makes it a lot more challenging for us to change the design and we would appreciate um consideration from the board obviously gray stars worked hard to get the building up and we&#39;re hoping to get it occupied but um and we apologize that that it came in this way but it they are up and affixed already again that&#39;s that&#39;s helpful one final question for me is um again i&#39;m inclined to just think all of it&#39;s okay as is but i am curious</td>

                <td> So moving to our sustainability narrative, the project, again, no motor vehicle parking. It will not add to traffic. It will not promote adding fossil fuel burning vehicles to the city. We are filling in all the existing curb cuts and that will increase pedestrian safety. The project will comply with green score requirements. We will remove the current motor vehicle used on the site. The orientation of the building will allow for better cross ventilation of the units. The project is pursuing a HERS certification for projects under 12,000 square feet of residential to meet the standards of the Specialized Energy Code. and will promote the goals of Somerville Pollinator Action Plan with pollinator-safe planting. So just a quick overview of the site. Located at the corner of Craigie and Somerville Lab, the site is served by two bus lines, 83 and 87. We are within the half mile radius to Porter Square. This is, again, that corner. We&#39;re going to be walking a little bit to the right to see the abutter to Fort Evenson Street side. You&#39;re going to notice there is a fire escape. There&#39;s a prescriptive easement to accommodate this fire escape. Going around, this is the back of the lot abutting 5-7 Craigie Street. And now we&#39;re going to be flying a little bit, looking from above all four sides. This is to the north. to the east, to the south, and the west. You can see here the car wash across the street. So the development is, again, not asking for any zoning relief. It is by right and complies with all our zoning requirements. We can come back to these slides if needed later on. The corner is a corner lot, right? So we have two fronts, a primary front on Somerville Ave and a secondary front on Craigie Street. So it has three sides and one rear. We have a 10-foot setback abutting NR and a 20-foot rear setback abutting NR. And we have a zero-side setback abutting MR3. but we will provide a minimum setback required for our neighbors, fire escape and egress. This is a proposed demolition of the structure. That&#39;s one story building that needs to be demolished. There&#39;ll be some concrete curbs that also need to be demolished and awning and a roof overhang with a concrete base columns and the sign also will be demolished. So onto the proposed design. We are developing a walk-up housing with duplexes and flats, again by rights, subject to special permit site approval, no unit parking, transit area, commercial space, on Somerville app, cross ventilation, for better living and units, no elevator, and standardized units. Overall, we are looking at 14,679 square feet of development. were 11,969 square feet of residential with 2,710 square feet of commercial. That yields 14 units, about 83% efficient. And the mix that we have, like I said before, sorry, I&#39;m repeating so much, five one-bedroom, seven two-bedrooms, two studios, two accessible units, which are tier one and tier two. Again, like Adam said, This is maybe still debated, but they won&#39;t have 0.8 remainder on the table. Alright, so we organize these slides to sort of look at first all of the ground plane features and the design has. So here in this slide you&#39;re going to see the main access points on Craigie Street is the main residential access. for the units. On some of the labs, there&#39;s a main commercial access, and there is also a secondary residential pedestrian access right next to our neighbors. And that takes you to a secondary access on the back. There is going to be a transformer in this location. right here, the transformer. We have received a preliminary load letter and we have started conversation with Eversource, our engineer. I&#39;ve identified that we need a 50 kVA transformer and this is the proposed location. The unit will be screened and will be open air. Now we&#39;re going to talk about trash. During neighborhood meeting one and two, there were several comments about trash location. how will trash be handled and how and then and secondary meeting was how uh um have you thought about putting the trash on craig street and we really want to talk to that point directly you know alex direct us to study a sketch that was proposed by our the neighbors of 2-4 evanson depicting their desired location of a two yard container uh for trash uh Patricia D&#39; It basically a trash room on the credit side, the image shows the area proposed by that sketch in red. Patricia D&#39; The issue, and this will have to have a curb cut right to access and a role, a roll up door to access it. Patricia D&#39; They just we encounter with this idea where that our commercial space depth will be reduced beyond what&#39;s allowed, which is a 30 foot depth minimum. And the rolling dumpster will require a curb cut and that will not allow us to infill the existing curb cut that&#39;s on Greggie Street. So that will reduce, you know, further reducing the possibilities of improving the street parking. And it will also, basically it wouldn&#39;t allow us to put the planter and will reduce our green score. Again, it will require an 8x8 roll-up door right next to a residential entry and Lupita D Montoya, Per udc comments, this was really frowned upon. Lupita D Montoya, So after looking at all these options are you know approved location for the trash is on the east side towards that second entry. There are two zones highlighted in green. One zone is almost like built into the building itself, screen and cover trash area right here at the bottom. At the top, there&#39;s a screen and cover recycling area. And this is really the option that yields the most functionality and flexibility. And it&#39;s been approved by the UDC. Soledad Villarreal, We are also looking into that exterior recycling area we&#39;re looking at enclosures that systems we&#39;re looking into that hopefully. Soledad Villarreal, You know, we can afford them that are rust and rat proof, so that they&#39;re not just things so we&#39;re looking into that idea and i&#39;m going to hand it to krista to talk about curb cut changes and bike parking okay. Thank you.</td>

                <td>I&#39;m Crystal Lucas. I&#39;m a senior transportation engineer with Howardstein Hudson. We submitted the transportation access plan to the mobility division as required for the project. As Sylvia mentioned, no vehicle parking will be provided on the project site. It is residential units and the location itself is very well suited for commuting. It&#39;s adjacent to the 83 and the 87 MBTA bus lines and it&#39;s less than half a mile or less than a 10 minute walk to Porter Square Station, which hopefully you all know has both the MBTA red line as well as commuter rail services and additional bus lines. So as this slide shows, three curb cuts are going to be closed, one on Craigie Street, that up and down one on the left side, and two on the Somerville Avenue. So those are the ones on the bottom right and left. So three curb cuts are being closed. Again, no vehicle access here, and so all of these can be closed and there won&#39;t be any curb cuts provided. uh bike parking next slide excellent sylvia&#39;s ahead uh bike car parking complies with somerville zoning ordinance the project is constructing a bike room uh that&#39;s that that top right box is pointing uh to that that 14 uh space bike room those are covered and secured for residents with access from the lobby and then there is a another set of two covered racks uh for uh for visitors and those are in that that middly box um pointed out and i don&#39;t know if sylvia i don&#39;t know if you can actually i don&#39;t know if you can just if you can in fact gesture through those with the mouse um but so we have uh two cup two covered racks which is for four spaces for visitors Krista Egger, In that courtyard and then on the bottom along somerville have there&#39;s another rack for another two spaces so again it&#39;s six visitor spaces and 14. Krista Egger, Permanent permanent covered indoor spaces for residents, so the project is exceeding the minimum requirements for bike parking and now i&#39;m going to pass it back to Sylvia, thank you.</td>

                <td>Sylvia Jones, Thank you krista. So on to other site issues. We want to talk about visibility from the corner. We know visibility is very important at the corner, so we&#39;re proposing a glazed corner to minimize visual obstructions. Here is a view looking through that corner. We&#39;re on Craigie Street going towards Somerville. Josiemer Mattei, PhD, MPH, So here in this diagram, we are showing the open common space areas where we are providing planting, seeding and visceral lighting. Josiemer Mattei, PhD, MPH, And then also here are the ground floor units private outdoor amenities, so they have their own little yards. Another comment from UDC was about adding a gate or fence behind the abutter&#39;s fire escape access to secure the site. In this diagram, you see a dashed blue line. This is the line where we are planning to install this type of fence. I&#39;m going to blow that up a little bit so you can see it in more detail. the fence will be located within our property line on a curb that is beyond the fire escape to maintain access to our neighbors who have an easement. And this is a kind of before and after view to sort of get a sense of the quality of that space. I&#39;m going to blow that up a little bit more. You&#39;re going to see the fencing beyond, this is all kind of blending in with the material of the sidewalk. And so there&#39;s no obstruction. And to clarify, triple clarify, this is a pedestrian walkway. This is just to access the second residential entry and to maintain the egress to some of the lab from our neighbor&#39;s fire escape. And because it came up in our neighborhood meeting number two, we just want to reinforce that there is no regular access to the space, the curb cut as shown here will be filled. All right, so moving on to not the site, but the building in green here, you see the residential units in the back. There&#39;s two studios and in teal there&#39;s one bedroom. In purple, there&#39;s the commercial space. In gray is the common interior lobby. the triangle show the access to stairs and units on the ground floor you take both stairs up to a common terrace and from that common terrace you have access to in green two bedroom duplexes and in teal one bedroom units from the terrace and then from you know there&#39;s a discrete entry for the third floor unit Again, the green is a duplex unit so they&#39;re moving internally and in teal you have the access to the one bedroom units which are located on the third floor. Now let&#39;s look at massing and facade. So the massing in this corner lot is broken into two blocks. This allows us to provide northern and southern exposure to all units for better light and for air circulation. At the bottom, you will see that the massing retracts, creating a recess that signals the residential entry that is now covered by the massing above. There&#39;s this continuous commercial space that allows flexibility and a really nice corner presence. We also have a green roof. I&#39;m going to keep moving on. Ana de Bettencourt- Our primary material is brick is a face brick in copper tone and it has two color accents that are going to be jade and coral too much as the brick these are fiber cement panel accents. Ana de Bettencourt- Here we have an elevation so primary elevation and, as you can see we&#39;re playing with the detail of the brick. We like to, you know, we&#39;re organizing the nothing in this grid, but we&#39;re playing with the movement, the ins and the outs of the bay to provide privacy to the balconies and to create also interest on some of the love. The color that we&#39;re using, this sort of green monster green, I guess, creates a focal point. And you can kind of start to see here the planter that we&#39;re We&#39;re loving this planter, which provides us with green score, but also creates a beautiful bench as he approaches the corners. It&#39;s a little bit of a social space as well. This is the Craigie Street approach going into Somerville Ave. The windows are varied, create a nice articulation, and the window frames also provide a subtle color, the pop-up color. In terms of signage, here&#39;s a strategy for awning and signage on the primary facade. I&#39;m going to move to this view. The awning is a thin metal extrusion as if you extruded the mullion out. It is supported by the balconies above. We think that locating the signage to the front makes it a little bit more visible. so you can see the detail on the brick here corbelling up that adds texture and add detail to the facade as you get close to it the ins and outs again provide privacy they provide structural continuity from top to bottom and they provide shading another um important aspect is contextual uh to our building is you know there&#39;s the question of sound and noise um are one in meeting uh number one for the neighborhood meeting number one the owner of the car wash cross summer of the lab said that he was supportive of the project but was concerned about residents in the new building complaining about having a 24-hour car wash across the street counselor even camping asked whether the units could be soundproof in some way such as by using special windows so we make this diagram just to show that there is not just a car wash it is also the existing mdta commuter rail both produce sound that is you know loud 60 decibels for the car wash by 85 for the commuter rail the commuter rail is a is a short 30 second sound the car wash we estimate a half an hour of constant sound as sound travels towards our building it diminish a little bit uh so we estimate that an 85 ends up being a 65 decibel, a 60 decibel ends up being almost like a 40 decibel when it hits the facade. So how do we counteract that? We&#39;re gonna have triple pane glazing in the bedroom areas that has an STC of 37 that will reduce the sound to 2.3 decibels for the 30 minute car wash sound and it will reduce it to 28 decibels for the MBTA sound. On top of that, we&#39;re going to follow best practices for acoustic design, right? So like acoustic caulking, sound insulation in our wall assemblies and sound reducing curtains could be another strategy. Another UDC comment we want to address today was to review the structure and the thickness of the balcony elements, ensure that the detailing comes across, and review how the windows interact with the flooring due to the thickness of the wood construction. I think our logic is that this grid reads very well, that there would be three equal horizontal bands. The design intent is that Ana Vizcarra Rankin she, Spandau condition be equal across all floors. It would be about six brick courses, 16 inches is the current assumption to accommodate the structure, insulation and floor assemblies. If additional space is needed, the detail will work properly and the logic of equal, equal, equal will be respected. Ana Vizcarra Rankin she, And also here you see a little bit of like our sun daylighting strategy. Okay, so now i&#39;m going to move to landscape and Christian is going to present our landscape and i&#39;ll patient you got to tell me next slide and i&#39;ll.</td>

                <td>yep yep absolutely Christian money everyone from offshoots starting at the ground level plan in our main goal here was to really create a nice outdoor communal space and amenities so we&#39;re showing this courtyard on the northeast. that corner with cafe style seating and catenary lighting and being framed by planting on the building side and on the property line side as well. This area also includes, as Krista mentioned, the outdoor bike parking, as well as enclosed trash areas, fully enclosed just to limit odor and make sure to produce rodent activity. Along Plan North, showing the three private patio spaces for the ground level units with low fences between them to divide each of those spaces. Along Craigie Street, we&#39;re showing that planter along the facade of the building as really an opportunity to bring greenery to the streetscape. And then on the Somerville outside just to echo what Sylvia said, making sure to provide the secondary pedestrian access while while maintaining safe and clear access to the butters fire escape. On the left are images showing the material choices, cast in place concrete paving along the streetscape to match Somerville standards and then a permeable unit pavers and P stone paving in in the areas along the back of of the of the building. On on the next slide you&#39;ll see some precedent images that give you a sense of these two main spaces. You know, simple movable furniture in the courtyard to create a flexible flexible space for for residents and. This this concept of the back patios being simple piece stone paving with with paving within just as a low maintenance way to create a green buffer without ground cover planting that that. We hope to turn you know, creating spaces for for rodents to to nest in in these areas. On on the next slide on Level two there&#39;s a terrorist that serves a circulation connecting the units, but also gives us the opportunity to create both private and communal spaces appear so. We&#39;re strategically using freestanding planters to create some visual separation between some of the private patio spaces created by the architecture and giving us the opportunity to have some communal tables out there as well along the railing on the north and east side of the terrace. On the next slide, throughout the This whole process we take into account, you know the specifics of the site in terms of sun exposure ground water flow and prevailing seasonal winds and, in particular, this helps us inform our plan. decisions to make sure that they&#39;re well adapted to these micro conditions and ensure maintenance and longevity so. You know, on the next on the next slide we&#39;ll see that this this project sits within a dense neighborhood so every bit of planting is is important and our office recently authored the Somerville pollinator action plan so we&#39;re excited to have. All of our planting strategies follow those guidelines and prioritize native plants that are that are actively supporting pollinator species and ecological diversity. and You know, offshoots in general as a practice is always thinking about performance, especially in these urban conditions. So as we do in a lot of our projects where we&#39;ve been sure to include a selection of tree species that have been shown to trap airborne pollutants, as well as deep rooted tree species that provide long term improvements to soil and groundwater qualities by sequestering and breaking down pollutants. So going back to that ground level plan our planting strategy here includes a basswood at the northeast corner of the property just to act as as a canopy tree and along those back patios showing Canadian service very for. ornamental accents and throughout that portion of the site mixing in quaking aspens and hybrid poplars, which are some of those species that have been shown to pull pollutants from the ground and the air along that northern to be productive and act as a seasonal buffer. We&#39;re also showing in that area Virginia creeper along the rear wall just to add a vertical greening element. And we&#39;ve also added a black Tupelo street tree on Somerville Ave, a species that&#39;s resilient and performs well in a streetscape condition. At the main entrance and along the courtyard edge, we&#39;re showing a mix of perennial species. That was right, Sylvia, on the next slide. Nope, nope, you&#39;re fine. And this is one of our selections from the pollinator action plan and chosen to have great seasonal interest and includes false indigo, clustered mountain mint, swamp milkweed, just to name a few. And on the second level, we&#39;re showing selection of shade-tolerant pollinator plant species. um which will be planted in in in those freestanding planters just to make sure that this becomes a a you know a low maintenance space that that can perform well and has serving ecological benefit uh up there on the roof level are the the planting strategy that we&#39;re that we&#39;re showing is using sedum cuttings mixed with native plug plantings to create this ecological green roof that has seasonal interest and creates a biodiverse planting palette that goes you know, beyond the green carpet of a single species, but really can begin to be a productive, you know, a productive landscape on a portion of the site that&#39;s usually very passive. And, you know, to wrap this up, the material selection of the design have allowed us to meet the target green score for MR3. So ensuring that, you know, all of these developments would bring ecological benefit and resilience to the neighborhood.</td>

I will remove an automotive use and replace it with housing and first floor commercial space as befits the MR3 zone. the project is sustainable as the experts have explained unlike the existing automotive use the project will reduce motor vehicle trips by having no parking whatsoever on site the current the currently entirely paved lot will have landscaping and extensive green roof which will help mitigate the heat island effect the project is dimensionally fully compliant with the somerville zoning ordinance for general building in the mr3 zone and no variances are being requested or required The project has been long owned and operated by the Varellas family, and Alex is here tonight. The family is seeking to redevelop their property to meet Somerville&#39;s changing needs and goals while respecting the abutter, particularly the abutter with the fire escape on the side, in order to keep that emergency egress along their property and providing sound attenuation regarding the train, the street, and the car wash noise as described. So, in all, the relief sought is the minimum relief necessary for a mixed-use building in the MR3 zone. An applicant requested this board grant, the site plan approval, and special permit being sought. Thank you.</td>

My ward is Ward 5. I hope that&#39;s it looks like that&#39;s okay. I live in this area, and that&#39;s probably an odd thing to say, having just said the previous, but I think it&#39;s important that people nearby come out and say how they&#39;re thinking about something. that&#39;s going to be near them. I am primarily in support of this project. I love the idea of there not being a parking lot there in that site. I love the fact that there&#39;s going to be a ton of housing in this project if it moves forward. have personally eaten canadian serviceberry so they are edible fyi by humans but they&#39;re not just decorative um and they&#39;re a native which is great um i&#39;m not worried about the trash i&#39;m i&#39;m not worried about the sound from the car wash the train etc um I I do want to put a note in that because this is currently zoned for Mr. 3. They can only be 3 stories tall, and is not required to have an elevator, and we have very little housing in Somerville that is Jessica Keever- elevator accessible wheelchair accessible, etc, there are two units in this that looks like they&#39;re going to be. Jessica Keever- wheelchair accessible, which is great, we have tiny amounts of affordable accessible housing and I, I would just put a note in for like can at least one of the accessible units be also designated affordable. I know that can&#39;t be answered during this hearing, but I want to put that note in, or that can&#39;t be answered to me directly anyway. I also wanted to put a note in that people who use wheelchairs also sometimes use bikes, and it might be good to take a look at the bike parking room and consult with someone who&#39;s a wheelchair user and a bicyclist and see about an adaptive bike parking option to make that accessibility more complete. um I do see a lot in this plan that&#39;s to love in terms of um trying to plan for all bunch of uh needs and hopes but I did want to put that out there as well um and I I really appreciate this uh this project like trying to work with the neighbors uh with a lot of diverse comments so thank you thank you very much</td>

One of them is, you know, a lot of times when we see development proposals, we&#39;re concerned that they&#39;re by very large international developers, that they&#39;re too big, that they&#39;re out of scale. Here we are with a transit-oriented, low parking, Adrian Holovaty, modest size project from a local family. Adrian Holovaty, I think this is exactly in the sweet spot Adrian Holovaty, for Adrian Holovaty, redevelopment, especially because it moves from automotive uses to housing to transit-oriented housing. It really seems like very much in line with the city&#39;s goals of um emphasizing this sort of project as as the sort of project that it wants to see so thank you very much for your time I think this is a great idea yeah thank you very much does anybody else want to speak in support of the application please raise your hand once going twice</td>

                <td>Good evening, Mr. Chairman, board members. Kenneth Lightner for the abutters at 669 Somerville Avenue, Don and Lottie. 675. 675, I&#39;m sorry. The abutters to the right, to the east of the project. And I have to speak to the impact that it&#39;s having on their property. We went through everything that you have. With the new building going up, they had windows to the side. They were going to generally lose their sight and the general airflow on that side of their building. And we went over the landscaping plans. There&#39;s no landscaping buffering this alleyway going down. It&#39;s just a causeway going down. And I imagine it&#39;s only for the purpose of getting the barrels down there and people coming up with bikes. It&#39;s been spoken. The architect first said that we have a prescriptive easement for the fire escape, which I would suggest is correct. So they had to keep that area open for the fire escape. But we are getting to take a... We&#39;re at the tail end of this. We&#39;re getting all the trashes located closest to our building, the recyclables and all the trash bins. There are 14 units and probably two commercial units. And how are they going to bring the trash down you know it&#39;s going to go it&#39;s going to come down between my clients building it&#39;s not going to affect these there are the residential units. And it&#39;s going to come down quite frequently and there&#39;s going to be quite a bit of trash, given the number of units, so we see that as a downside to the overall design. And, you know, we talked about putting it on the other side. They don&#39;t necessarily have to have a rollout. They could configure it to put it out on the Craggy Street side. But we&#39;re bearing the burden of all the trash coming down. We&#39;re losing some light and air there. They didn&#39;t talk about in the plans, the snow removal plan, where they&#39;re going to put the snow, you know, and what type of in what type of water prevention they&#39;re going to have against my client&#39;s building when they pave there. Are they going to put any sort of berm or buffer? I think it&#39;s things that have to be looked at. The site entrances are going to be on Craigie and Broadway, but everything, you know, the trash and the bicycles and the snow storage is all going to be on my client&#39;s side of the building. And we asked for some real consideration. I think it&#39;s a weighty matter. We&#39;re the closest of butter to them. And we&#39;re going to be at a burden of all of the trash, the traffic, the bicycles, trash removal coming up, and possibly the water flow. There was nothing, you know, we don&#39;t know if we&#39;re going to have any water problems coming down because there isn&#39;t, it is pitched down coming that way. Well, yeah, potentially deliveries on the side door to the two businesses coming up that private way. So I think we bear all the burden that I think it&#39;s unfair in that regard. You know, we don&#39;t have anything against development. We just think it should be configured in a different manner. None of the other butters are bearing this and really the residential units aren&#39;t it&#39;s all it&#39;s all it&#39;s closest to our building. So I want to pass that along.</td>

It&#39;s like if everything came up clean, why are we selecting a plant mix that will specifically help remediate pollutants from the from the ground.

You know, in being a firm that practices in urban environments and that has done research in phytoremediation of plants. It&#39;s something that we as a practice make sure to incorporate in all of our projects, regardless of the site, just as really a way of ensuring that plantings are being productive and You know, not not just being reactive to the sites, but being forward thinking. And, you know, this is this is something that ensures that. Any any pollutants that may come from abutting properties, air particulate matter from abutting properties, groundwater again from from the general area is is something that we&#39;re we&#39;re thinking of. um in in the future and is something that we we like to incorporate again not as um not always thinking of it as a reactive measure but more as a proactive measure to ensure that um we&#39;re specifying plans that are that that go beyond just meeting and fixing uh the needs of one particular site but creating really a network throughout throughout the city so that&#39;s our general approach um in our in our practice and and to say is is no different</td>

So the site was, I&#39;m guessing 100% impervious cover existing. Right? So you&#39;re putting new building on top of it. You&#39;re not changing the impervious cover at all. That being said, this is still an opportunity to use. um particularly the landscaping to help mitigate the runoff coming from that um impervious cover again i i&#39;m not i&#39;m not upset um you know it&#39;s 100 right now it&#39;s going to be actually less than 100 because you have a green roof so my question is can you use the ground plantings to further mitigate the runoff coming from the site um have you thought about that at all</td>

I&#39;m very supportive of this building and it&#39;s great looking project. I think it. As as a lot of people have said, as as Mr Webber has said, it takes a gas station, which an auto use, which, by the way, I like, and I have used to something that is something that the city needs. I think it&#39;s a, it&#39;s a, it&#39;s a well, meaning and good project. Generally, and I&#39;ll kind of start with that. Some of the questions that I had not concerns. Not so much of the issue. I think things things that we can. Clarify and maybe make a little bit better or a few things. Some of which have been raised by by other people, so I&#39;ll start with with those the. Little alleyway between the 2 buildings between yours and it was a concern that. Was raised about trash. I was wondering if you can remind me how trash is going to be handled in your building where it&#39;s going to be because. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair to have a bunch of trash bins necessarily next to another residential use if at all possible. So I&#39;m wondering if we might be able to revisit what your thoughts were on the trash situation with your building.</td>

The reality is, you know, Ubers and Lyfts and cabs are going to drop off where they&#39;re going to drop off. We&#39;ve all been in them. I don&#39;t care where the designated drop off spot is. They&#39;re going to go where they&#39;re going to go. To the extent that we might be able to put them on On Craigie, instead of double parking on some of the Avenue, you know, that&#39;s, you know, I think a better option. You only have 14 units. So it&#39;s not going to be a massive amount of listen at a given point. as well as the fact that I know that there is a bike lane and we don&#39;t want to impede the mobility of vehicles and bikes and things like that on some of the left. The consideration could be, see if we might be able to encourage people to drop off on Craigie or further up the street or whatever it might be, knowing that UberDrop is going to do what they&#39;re going to do. The other thought I had actually, and this is our meeting when when Amelia is not with us right now, but this is speaking in Amelia&#39;s. Level of concern is where loading might go for for that commercial space. particularly in light of the other concerns that we just raised about the Uber and Lyfts. That&#39;s going to be a 30 second in and out for 14 units. This is going to take longer than that and impede multiple modes of transportation if it&#39;s done on Somerville Avenue. I&#39;m wondering if we might be able to have some discussion on that. I see Krista, but this is an open discussion.</td>

Both Lynn and I completely understand your concern, particularly with that bike lane and knowing you use that bike lane, which means you know that People who, in fact, double park tend to do it in bike lanes, which makes bicycling less safe. But then, in fact, you know, to take the road, and this is an existing condition throughout Somerville and throughout all of our communities. We have, in fact, within the transportation access plan, we did, in fact, work with the city and mobility division to designate some of those meters during some of the day as loading and pickup drop-off. So those could be And again, in Somerville, you have the option to pull a permit for street parking for a moving truck. But like some of the commercial neighbors up and down Somerville have, we tried to be consistent. Within some of those meters are, in fact, it&#39;s limited between 8 and noon as delivery only. And then it becomes two-hour metered parking, which should help with, in fact, it will work If nobody is loading there, then in fact, Ubers and Lyfts can be there. It is limited. It is between 8 and noon, which then makes those meters available during the peak times when meters are most apt to be used, which tends to be more midday. So we have, in fact, worked with the mobility division to try to, in fact, maximize how this can best work. And then similarly along craigie street is adding some additional with closing those curb cuts we add some additional residents part residential permit parking. But also, hopefully, and it is good in somerville and parking is tight um but when when there are when they are not being used, you can still always. Do active loading or unloading without a permit so so if there is a space available when and you may have to drive a little farther down. to do your drop offs. So but anyway, but there is in fact a designated loading spot 8 to noon where those where some of those meters are as well as the meters as well as additional spaces and new spaces with all of these closed curb cuts. So hopefully that helps a bit.</td>

Tom Epstein, We don&#39;t obviously we&#39;re under 20 as well, the same discussion from the from the previous group that we talked about the whole reason we could do walk up housing is because we&#39;re under 20 units that&#39;s why we get away from doing an elevator. But when I say get away from, it&#39;s not a negative. I think it&#39;s a positive. Think about MR3s as walk-up housing, as in terms of being accessible in a different way, because it does drive down the cost. It does drive down the rental cost of being able to live in this building, because it is an MR3 in that particular scale. So I think there&#39;s a unique opportunity for the MR3s to think about walk-up housing in terms of the urban condition. I think others have spoken of the scale of this building. And I think that&#39;s the benefit of doing the MR3s this way, personally. The three, the two versus the three bedroom, we you know, we we talked to you to see about the two and three, and I think kind of the general building versus apartment building kind of came up when we looked at Somerville zoning. If you look at general building, they they specifically say, you know, it&#39;s basically unit type sizes and bedroom counts for smaller households. So we take that as two bedroom versus the apartment is the same thing for larger households. And so that was our kind of threshold when we talked to UDC between the two and three. Rob Geddes, The. Rob Geddes, It could accommodate a three bedroom probably in the north building if we if we needed to, but I, but I think we prefer the two bedroom mix in general in terms of affordability, for many reasons. Rob Geddes, And that&#39;s kind of we&#39;re kind of where we ended up.</td>

                <td> Okay, I mean I would be honest that&#39;s not the best set of answers from my perspective. I think it would really go a long way if you could find an element to improve the diversity of the stock a bit. I do appreciate the general idea and sentiment that you want to make those ground floor units all accessible, so if there&#39;s any way to make that a little bit more firm, would definitely appreciate that. But yeah, if you&#39;re not going to find a way to keep rates low, but you&#39;re also going to make an argument that you want to avoid creating accessible housing to keep costs low, I feel like you&#39;re not doing what you can for the community in that way. So I just want to kind of put that general sentiment out there. And then finally, to wrap up, you know, would definitely love to hear if you guys have any more creativity around the trash. I think it&#39;s definitely worthwhile responding to the abutters concerns there. And then the last comment, just, you know, as much as I&#39;ve been pushing on the diversity here, I do appreciate the fact that you guys are trying to put in a bunch more housing. So obviously, we need it. And, you know, I am at a high level supportive of trying to get more housing here.</td>

It feels like a lot of the details of the project have been thought through carefully. Echo Member McNeely&#39;s concerns around the unit mix, so just another voice interested in pushing there. The couple other thoughts I wanted to share HAB-Jacques Juilland. : From my things, but I grew up just on the Cambridge side of the commuter rail tracks on the at the end of Oxford street, so I know this area really well. HAB-Jacques Juilland. : That in terms of noise, no one seems to be raising big concerns about that, but you know the trains. HAB-Jacques Juilland. : You get used to it right away, and if you have any removed from it on the other side of the street you hardly notice it over time at all um. Will Olney, And just big picture I really love the mix of housing first for commercial there it&#39;s a weird stretch of some of the lab where. Will Olney, If you&#39;re looking at this property to the left, you get the like awkward strip molly place with the laundromat and the subway and it&#39;s not very walkable at all, even though it&#39;s so close to porter square. Will Olney, So things have been added along the stretch between porter and and Union, and I feel like this project. Will add people and just vibrancy and if we get good commercial on that ground floor it&#39;ll feel much more like a neighborhood that could could you know it&#39;s going to take a lot of changes. For many properties along that whole stretch, but this is exactly the kind of puzzle piece that I think could get us there to a better neighborhood feel between porter and all the way up to Union so that&#39;s something I like a lot too so that&#39;s what I got.</td>

I just wanted to say that I certainly appreciate the applicant team&#39;s efforts for this project. I do think that Somerville needs additional housing. I think what the questions and concerns raised by most of my colleagues is something that I shared. So I&#39;m not going to ask any any questions and repetition, but I do want to better understand when it comes to the building energy source. I know in one of the neighborhood meetings, there was a conversation around fossil fuel hookups versus electric. And at that point in time, the discussion was around the building is more likely to be electric. Just wanted to see if the applicant team has any updates or any other thoughts around energy conservation efficiency at all.</td>

                <td> So I think one of the, one of the, if we take a step back, just like a housing typology, it&#39;s like the double loaded corridor is probably the least efficient building you could do because you lose cross ventilation because you have a middle corridor. You can no longer have differential pressure on two sides of a building. So this idea we can do walk-up housing, we can actually have exposure on north and south simultaneously. You can open a window on the north and open a window on the south with cross ventilation. You don&#39;t have to turn on your air conditioner, for example. So inherently built in the typology, I think it is more energy conscious, let&#39;s say. On top of that, I have to go back to that section, but the balconies are completely shaded in the summer, but then they also let sunlight in in the winter, for example. So there&#39;s a recess in the balcony that&#39;s intentional to kind of maximize solar heat gain in the winter, but then minimize it in the summer, for example. So I think there&#39;s a lot of passive strategies that are good. We&#39;re not actively generating solar power. It&#39;s not part of the project right now, but I think the passive strategies are very strong with kind of walk-up housing.</td>

It may not be feasible, but it is certainly something that I think is is worth talking about. So, let&#39;s do this. Let&#39;s leave the written comment open until Friday. The twenty ninth at nine AM. Was it. planning board at SomervilleMA.gov. That is correct planning board at summer. The address has changed to the 29th at 9. A. M. and. Let&#39;s reconvene in 2 weeks next meeting is the 4th at 6. P. M. and we can see where we&#39;re at. But I think I think. Pretty pretty generally, we&#39;re, we&#39;re supportive as a board or certainly I am as as 1 member on on your project. So. I&#39;m looking forward to continuing this discussion. Is there anything else that you as the applicant team want to raise before we move to continue and I go get something to eat?</td>

                <td>Yeah, no, I appreciate all the feedback from everybody, and thank you. This was a great discussion. I appreciate you taking so much time with us. Yeah, I mean, we&#39;ll come back next time. I mean, keep in mind, it is only an MR3 project. It&#39;s a relatively smallish building. The unit mixes have been sort of discussed, and we went over this with the UDC, as was said. It&#39;s not like we haven&#39;t, like we were just trying to not do it. We&#39;ve actually looked into it. We just felt this was the best way to go and this is not a kind of a lean not a super profit building we&#39;re not building a high rise we&#39;re not high priced National developers it&#39;s just the varela&#39;s family doing a smallish building so just to keep that we&#39;ll look at it we&#39;ll look at it I&#39;m just saying I figured that was going to be the case but yeah it&#39;s certainly we can look at a brief discussion I think is is certainly worthwhile since since we&#39;ve had that I just want to set expectations is all. But yeah, we will go back, certainly. The Shell dolls are very smart people. We&#39;ll take a look at it.</td>
