Doug was bigger than life, full of energy, enthusiastic, and a very hard worker. In addition to his regular job as a computer marketing manager, Doug was a lifetime swimmer who competed in some of the most challenging swims in the world, including nearly 30 swim across America events. We extend our sincere sympathy to his wife, Laura.</td>

Following his honorable discharge, he continued his service and joined the Sunwell Police Department. Robert enjoyed playing golf in his earlier years and was an avid sports fan. He always supported the Patriots and Celtics, but didn&#39;t care for the Red Sox. As a history buff, he especially enjoyed war history. Once Marine, always Marine, he attended the annual Marine Corps reunion where he enjoyed connecting with his fellow Marines. The beloved husband of Barbara Hodnett, together they were married for over 40 years. He was the father of Ricky Silvestri, Vinnie Silvestri, Robert Hodnett, and his wife Erica, and Justin Hodnett and his wife DeFay. Dear brother of James Hodnett and his wife Sandra of Kennebunk, Maine. Cherished grampy of Kylie, Abigail, Matthew, Sophia, Whitley, and Kennedy.

You know, I walked past Houghton Street yesterday, and the center of it was milled up because it was finally getting repaved after utility work on it last year. I think the hot top just went down today. So seeing this plan here with Houghton Street being dug up in the exact same place again the day after it&#39;s been paved seems a little off to me. There are other utility drop points nearby, possibly from Prospect Street. So I&#39;d just like to get this sent in the committee. I don&#39;t have a set of conditions prepared tonight for it, but I do know there&#39;s a lot of concern from neighbors down there. And while they would like to get this done before winter weather so that that building can have service, There&#39;s just a lot of concerns about the placement and timing on this so if we could send this one to committee I&#39;d appreciate it Okay, I see no discussion.</td>

As many of you in the room here are already quite aware that we have some personnel matters to address, so we will take up the report of the committee on Confirmation of Appointments and Personnel Matters. After that, we&#39;ll probably pause for some pictures if folks want to take some extra pictures. And then when we reconvene, we&#39;re going to take item 9.2 out of order at the request of the administration. So if there&#39;s no objection, Madam Clerk, would you please? Well, item 6A is the committee report.</td>

                <td> Council, you and Kevin. Thank you, Mr. President. The Committee on Confirmation and Appointments met on this Monday. We recommend approval of two appointments, one to the Zoning Board of Appeals and one to the Planning Board. And I just want to take a quick moment. When we... When I joined the council with a number of colleagues, we were often banging the drum in this committee that we wanna see really qualified candidates for these roles. And I cannot overstate how much that has been happening over the last few years. We recommended approval of Olivia Mobied to the Zoning Board of Appeals, just an incredibly impressive person and resume, most recently a project manager on the bus network redesign for the MBTA, which I know many of us are familiar with. We also recommended confirmation of Coralie Cooper to the planning board. Ms. Cooper, I wanna make sure I get it right, she has most recently been the deputy director of the Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management, has a lot of experience at the Volpe Center and just brings a wealth of experience and we&#39;re really lucky to have Folks like this in our community stepping up for in many ways kind of thankless jobs, you know get yelled at a lot and make tough decisions So we&#39;re happy to recommend those two for approval and then the reason we have a big crowd here tonight And it&#39;s wonderful to see especially so many young people. Thank you all for being here. We have eight Promotions within the police department. I&#39;m just gonna briefly read them out Michael Perrone we recommended approval promotion to the position of police captain rico isidoro to the position of police lieutenant mark defava to the position of police lieutenant joseph tevis to the position of police sergeant justin costa to the position of police sergeant patrick canty to the position position of police sergeant cassandra camper to the position of police sergeant and richard levy jr to the position of police deputy chief The committee was, of course, extremely impressed with all of these candidates. Before the meeting, I was able to review with the chief all of their records and was incredibly impressed myself. I&#39;m happy that we recommended approval of all of these unanimously. And with that, I ask that the committee report be accepted, and then we can start the ceremony.</td>

When the planets and stars align and a little black cat with a popular agenda of crime ascends the political ladder of the community path, a ghost crosses the wheel. Yes, this is the spectral math. This year, we solemnly welcome you to another seasonal spooky series of trucks, treats, monsters, and undying mysteries. On October 18th, two to six on Somerville Avenue, Monster Mash presents a ghoulish promenade. Games, music, both shrill and true, carving pumpkins, no need to be afraid. Then truck or treat right here on October 23rd, BYO costumes and we&#39;ll bring the treats with enchanting screams to be heard when the Loch Ness Loader hits the street. Come one, come all to our yearly show and to the next mayor who shall serve in Minerva&#39;s shadow. Ghoul luck. We look forward to working with Boo. Just don&#39;t forget your undead constituents because they won&#39;t forget you. May our spooky season be safe, delightful, and ever so frightful. Yours, Ghoulie, the City Hall Ghost.</td>

So with that, as 4.2 is discussing what happens when discarded socks are left for days in the area. If these items are significant to anyone who may have left them, can we work with community partners, say Somerville Homeless Coalition, to create an additional off-site location so whatever snag there is that is preventing these items from being relocated in a more expeditious way, cool. Can we have some... storage cube box or something nearby to where they could be placed because I am hearing continuously from residents in the area that this is an issue and it is piled up. So there&#39;s that. Resolution 4.4, Councilor Davis and I learned in the Davis Square neighborhood business meeting that The needles that are reported from Health and Human Services Department, the needles that are found are counted, if a box of unused needles are found, they&#39;re counted in the collection of needles. But so there&#39;s not really a deciphering of unused or used needles. So I think it&#39;s a fair request to get a breakdown because I think that skews the data. Happy to have Councillor Davis speak on this if he wishes as well. Mr. Chair.</td>

                <td> Thank you, Councillor Davis. Thank you, Mr. President, and through you, thank you to my good colleague at large for working on these items with me. I&#39;ll just speak briefly. I sign on to everything that Councillor Scherzer said about the intent here. In terms of the belongings, obviously the first two items kind of work together. We heard on Monday, and we&#39;ve heard a number of times throughout various discussions about addressing some of the challenges that we and all of our neighbors are facing, including those who don&#39;t have a place to go with the roof over their head at night. And among those discussions has been What do we do with stuff? And there&#39;s a very, in my observation, there&#39;s a very broad spectrum there. And this goes from, on one end, somebody setting up a shelter of some sort, tents, et cetera, to perhaps on the other end, forgive me for using for maybe the sort of loose establishment what what one or the other end might be but um you know for the sake of making the point um i&#39;ve received pictures that i&#39;m sure others have seen of what appears to be discarded items around the porta potty that is in seven hills park that&#39;s there so folks have a place to uh you know to do what they have to do um and so it strikes me that there&#39;s there&#39;s probably some room you know somewhere along that spectrum to treat things differently And that&#39;s my intent in having this conversation is just to understand the approach as it stands currently and the degree to which there&#39;s a range of approaches of how the city will respond to various items and to discuss whether there&#39;s some room for adjustment. I think, you know, It may well be that there&#39;s an opportunity to remove things that seem clearly to be abandoned, and I use the word abandoned in item 4.2 very deliberately. It&#39;s a legal concept. I don&#39;t necessarily mean it in its legal context here, but very closely. Something that does appear to have been abandoned versus something that is, you know, very well perhaps may not be. We know for certain that when folks who are experiencing homelessness are separated from their belongings, it often can set them back weeks or months on any path that they may be attempting to undertake to get themselves into a better position where they have supports, where they have housing, where they have treatment, medication, identification, other paperwork, just information about services that they may have been interested in. Grab the pamphlet, for example. We try and create situations where people have touch points. I fully understand how damaging it can be when folks are separated from their belongings, and that absolutely has to remain central to this conversation. But as I said, it strikes me that there may be an end of the spectrum where We&#39;re very confident that&#39;s not going to be a concern, and we might be able to adjust our approach here. So that&#39;s all I&#39;m looking for in that regard. And as Councillor Strezo explained the request for data regarding needles very well. The only thing I&#39;ll add is, and this is on me, I neglected to request a time frame here. And I think through you, Mr. President, to the administration, certainly my intent and i won&#39;t speak for council shows or anyone else is is you know let&#39;s start with whatever we have is easily accessible right so to the degree that there that we have data that is that can be you know easily broken out into these different categories for um you know whichever if we have it for the past calendar calendar year or last 12 months great if we have it for this calendar year great if we have it only for the last three months like let&#39;s start with what we have that&#39;s easy And I&#39;m hopeful through you, Mr. President, to the Chair of Public Health and Public Safety that these could go on the agenda at the next meeting for that committee. And if we feel like we want more information and there&#39;s some digging to be done, then we can certainly have the conversation there. But I want this request to be taken in the spirit of I don&#39;t want to create a huge work project here. Let&#39;s start with what we have and what you can present, and we&#39;ll kind of go from there. That&#39;s all I have. Thank you, Mr. President.</td>

And I think try also, I&#39;ve been hearing a lot from constituents about the importance of regulating the speed. And there&#39;s not a lot we can do as a city to do that because a lot of it is set by the state. So I think having that conversation is important so that users understand what we can do and we cannot do and because we cannot do that so how can we think creatively so that we can still come up with ways to make the community path safer so that&#39;s yeah that&#39;s a follow-up</td>

Yes, I wanted to know, because it is fresh on my mind that we were talking about the Davis Square section of Community Path and the meeting that happened last, the safety meeting that happened in the region, and it was brought up by several residents that the Community Path at night, a couple of female residents people in the area said they felt very unsafe at nighttime. So that&#39;s why I wasn&#39;t sure if it were, are we talking like mobility safety? Are we talking physical safety? Are we talking about emotional safety? What kind of safety are we talking about? Thank you for elaborating. I do want to sign on to this as it is a mobility safety issue because yes, It really is astounding to me how I see so many people using the community path, and it is for everyone, and I think one quick inch move to the left or right can really harm someone if someone&#39;s speeding down in a very fast way and not think that this is a path for all of us. And it&#39;s just basic safety and consideration for all of us using the path. And I&#39;m hoping we can at least push that standard, that moral standard for all of us. But let&#39;s see. Thanks for putting this forward. What&#39;s up, Councillor Clingan? Thank you.</td>

We, as the council, have also gotten reports from constituents that There seems to be activity of the sort in Somerville. I&#39;d love for members of the committee to bring that element to this discussion as well, because what that would mean in effect, if it is true, is that the ordinance as written is being flouted by some homeowners and also that there&#39;s money on the table when we&#39;re talking about this three percent community impact fee so let&#39;s bring that those funds in and put them where they need to go which by law includes affordable housing and make sure that we can have a great community where everyone can live forever thank you council wilson</td>

                <td> Thanks, Mr. President. We&#39;ve talked about this. We got an update in, I think, during budget season. So to Councillor Burnley&#39;s point about who&#39;s trying to get around this, we used to use some software to try to catch people. We got the update during budget season that we were discontinuing use of that software. I&#39;ve talked to Director Bean about some alternative software options out there that I&#39;ve seen demoed that go beyond just simply catching people, but actually have some really interesting tools around. They track the price that&#39;s being charged because actually, We have to kind of go sometimes ask for more money from DOR than what they&#39;re offering us. And it helps us prove our case that actually, you know, we can show that it was rented on these nights at this amount using the software. And that allows us to basically go get it. are just due basically from dor so i think it&#39;s this is a discussion that where uh we should be looking also at what software options out there would allow us to properly monitor this and then to get what we are owed from dor as well</td>

                <td> Okay, thank you. Councilor Mbah would like to sign on as well. There are a few places I think this could go. My instinct is that it could go to finance, although the way it&#39;s drafted, it strikes me as a housing community development question, which is why I wanted to see the chair&#39;s thought on that in terms of getting it on an agenda. But if it has been discussed in finance and it has a better chance of getting on agenda quickly there, I&#39;m happy to defer to the will of the council. It could be taken up at either of those committees. Legislative matters would be the other one, but I think, you know, at this point, we&#39;re not at the point of changing the ordinance. We&#39;re looking at where we are with things, so. Okay, that going to Housing Community Development? All right, I think that&#39;s a good place to start the conversation. So that will be laid on the table for approval with a copy sent to Housing and Community Development. Thank you, Madam Chair.</td>

If you&#39;ve ever been coming down Walnut and you come to the street known as Sunnyside, there&#39;s like this big sort of property wall where these old markers were of like the olden times, you know, like these big pillars basically and these big bushes. And there&#39;s only a sidewalk on one side of Sunnyside. And essentially people park right up to the edge of the intersection of Sunnyside and Walnut. And if someone&#39;s coming off of Sunnyside, they can&#39;t get out of Sunnyside onto Walnut. But there&#39;s other issues as well just in terms of speeding and it&#39;s just a disaster waiting to happen We also have kids that walk that way Daily, you know me and councillor McLaughlin and put in requests for a mid block crosswalk there So I&#39;d like this to go to traffic and parking, please All right, so, you know for the discussion that oh Sorry councillor Burnley is your hand up on that one?</td>

So at this October 11, you know, Affordable Housing Trust meeting, the sum of the Affordable Housing Trust fund review finances showing 2.6 million in CPA funds and 11.9 million in non-CPA funds available. and authorized $400,000 in fiscal year 2026 for housing assistance RFPs to be advertised in mid-September. I&#39;m sure this probably already happened. Updates included the mayor&#39;s selection of Nick Pittman for the banking and finance trustee seat. That was a vacant seat. A mortgage amendment request for 24 Webster Street and a time extension for the 15 Temple Street project, which will add 115 affordable units. The trust also approved two contracts under the municipal voucher program for about $1 million with the Cambridge Housing Authority for administration and rental subsidies, and also about $100,000 with CARS for housing search and stabilization services, ensuring uninterrupted support for households that are in need. Thank you, Mr. President.</td>

But no new funds expected in 2026 and 2027. So the trustees review program updates, including the skill wrap-up and English language learning project, which underperformed and left about $95,000 unspent, sparking discussion about returning funds to the port. They also heard updates on the municipal job RFP under review and the fall 2025 RFP with proposals due in October. So planning began for the November 20, annual meeting to highlight program impact, preview investment, and engage employers and the community in sustaining the trust work through partnership and state funding opportunities.

In addition to the minutes from our September 23rd meeting, we unanimously recommended that you approve tonight an extension of our online bill payment contract with City Hall Systems, and there was a clarification on this that was asked for on Tuesday night that was sent out today. Hopefully folks had a chance to read that. That answered an outstanding question from the other night. Additionally, we recommend that you approve tonight an increase of the stipend for the municipal hearing officer. We learned that was to ensure coverage through the end of the calendar year while a replacement is hired. Also, four prior invoice items. appropriation of nearly a million dollars a quarter million dollars sorry from the 10 cents per rideshare trip in Somerville in FY 24 that&#39;s going to be used to increase funding for our FY 26 vision zero work also a $100,000 from Encore and a little over 50,000 from the Mass Cultural Council. Those are both going to local cultural council grants through the Arts Council. And finally, three state grants totaling nearly half a million dollars for E911 personnel training and medical dispatch. Finally, we had a discussion on Council Member Mbah&#39;s order asking for reporting on our many stabilization funds, a number of which are dormant. We also discussed Bill Valletta&#39;s comprehensive public communication about this, Director made sure that that we knew that he&#39;s available uh for counselors to have offline conversations ahead of what we hear will be an upcoming update to this council on some strategy in this area so with that i ask that you approve this committee report as submitted any discussion all right let&#39;s do a roll call vote on the report</td>

                <td> Thank you, Mr. President. We met for a brisk hour and a quarter on September 30th and had three big items in front of us. One of them we kept in committee, that is the approval of a home rule petition to raise some spending thresholds, bidding thresholds for contracts to go to entities, basically a way to raise the thresholds under which things have to go to a certain bidding process, allowing us to grant more contracts to disadvantaged businesses. So this is very similar to the City of Boston and Cambridge&#39;s work. We kept it in committee because there were a few language questions which we received some email from on Monday. So I&#39;d ask my colleagues who got a copy of that, please let me know by tonight because I have to get the agenda in for Tuesday if you&#39;re ready to proceed on that one. Outside of that we did approve move two things for approval after some minor edits one of which is a Home rule petition allowing us to raise the maximum amount of fines for violations I know folks in the community and the City Council as well are excited about this Previously our maximum that we could assign to any ticket for any municipal violation was $300 and that will be going up so That is up for a vote tonight. And then also up for a vote tonight will be ordainment of an amendment. to let&#39;s see section 7 in section 111 B to require notification to tenants of parking limitations so when we have this new relatively new in the last several years regime that folks who are coming into new build apartments in MR zones near transit are ineligible for parking permit and it&#39;s just the parking department knows this uh presumably the people buying building and selling these units know this we just want to make sure that everybody who is potentially going to be living in those units is aware of it when they&#39;re going to apply for those apartments or to purchase that residence so this just adds a notification requirement for any units that are in those areas so with that those two things i think are going to be up for us for separate votes and i ask that the committee report be accepted and submitted any discussion questions</td>

                <td> Thank you, Mr. President. The Traffic and Parking Committee met with all three members present. All items were marked as completed and two were kept in committee. Regarding installing crosswalks across Wellness Street and Wigglesworth Street, Director Postowait said that the challenge is weighing the priority for doing these locations versus all other requests around the city. We received an update on the community path safety improvements. Director Rawson stated that a community engagement process has been launched to discuss safety and upgrades to the community paths. Mobility and engineering staff are reviewing data and signage will be developed and installed perhaps in the spring. Regarding installing the left turn signal for vehicles turning from Somerville Ave onto Bow Street, Director Rawson stated that a left turn traffic signal is not appropriate at this location. It was explained that a more appropriate option would be a left turn after a stop sign. In regards to the efforts to fix the unsafe crossing of the community path at School Street, Director Postaway reported that the city hired the consultant to produce a design and that it should be ready in October for presentation. We discussed the Magoon Square Municipal Parking Lot sign. Director Winfred requested that a specific language be sent to her so a new sign can be made. We discussed the removal of the do not block intersection signage at the intersection of Broadway and Hinkley Street. Both directors said that this area is due for street reconstruction where this will be addressed. Pinkney Street has been added to the speed hump list and that a neighbor way in the area is something Director Rossin will follow up with with the Worldwide Counselor. Director Rawson gave us the background of what happened with the 90 bus route. Regarding the request to install stop signs on 10 Hills Road at Governor Winthrop Road, Director Rawson explained that federal guidelines dictate a certain due diligence steps are taken, and if the city cannot meet the requirements, staff will try to find other ways to alleviate the problem. Regarding the request to update the traffic signal equipment at the intersection of Rogers Avenue and Boston Ave, Director Posterway stated that it&#39;s best to incorporate this request into a larger project, possibly in the next few years, to make it more doable. Regarding the request to install rapid flashing beacon with push button stop sign in front of the East Somerville Community School, Director Austin stated that this type of sign is typically used on a longer crossing, not on narrow streets. However, if this concern continues, staff will look at available options. I request that the report be accepted as submitted.</td>

So for folks who may be watching at home, the council recently has taken the general practice with new appointments of asking those to be approved that night, unless there&#39;s an objection, of course, because something can always be sent to committee. So this would be consistent with the recent practice for new officer appointments. Did I get that right, Mr. Chair? Very well. All right. Any further discussion? We call the roll on that one? We don&#39;t need to. Don&#39;t need to. Really? That&#39;s the one we don&#39;t need to call the roll? Go figure. Okay. That item is approved. No, it&#39;s laid on the table for approval. Laid on the table for approval. All right, I was just going to do it. Okay, fine.</td>
