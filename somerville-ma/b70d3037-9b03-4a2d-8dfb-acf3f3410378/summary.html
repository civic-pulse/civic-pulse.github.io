<li>This item was discussed in conjunction with 5.2 through 5.5 (communications received regarding 5.1).</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li>Councilor Ewen-Campen expressed strong frustration and disappointment regarding the indefinite postponement of the Highland Avenue redesign community process. He noted that the initial meeting was in October 2021, and despite repeated statements and a dedicated city website indicating a July 2025 start for design and outreach, no action has been taken. He criticized the lack of honest communication from the Mayor's office, stating that misleading the public erodes trust. He argued that a redesigned Highland Avenue with bike lanes is crucial for commuter safety and to alleviate congestion on the Community Path.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li>Councilor Burnley introduced the resolution concerning 161 Broadway, a historic automotive garage. He described an opportunity for a local company, Topologic (automated sweater manufacturing), to share the space, creating jobs and civic space. The challenge is the current owner's desire to retain the existing licenses (used car dealer, garage) even if not actively used, to ensure future flexibility. He sought council support to facilitate this innovation.</li>
<li>Councilor McLaughlin moved to send it to Housing and Community Development.</li>
<li>Councilor Burnley preferred Licenses and Permits, arguing it's more relevant to licensing.</li>
<li>Councilor Davis argued it's more of an economic development issue and that Housing and Community Development is appropriate, especially since the ward councilor sits on that committee.</li>
