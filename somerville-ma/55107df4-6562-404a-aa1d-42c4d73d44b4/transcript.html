So that takes us to item number two, which is 25-1044, requesting ordainment of an amendments to sections 7-64 and 7-65 of the Code of Ordinances to reduce displacement of tenants and update relocation payments. This is our so-called condo conversion ordinance that has been in place for quite a long time, actually. There was a significant update made a few years back, and then I think maybe another tweak or two along the way. And this was requested to address sort of continued challenges with folks being displaced, particularly when there was a sale of a property prior to a condo conversion. Excuse me. So I know that we are joined this evening by Director Alan Schachter from the Office of Housing and Sustainability, as well as always by Brendan Salisbury, our legislative and policy analyst. Brendan, do you have anything you want to discuss with us or introduce to us in this, or should we, or Director Schachter, or are you... Who wants to take the lead in sort of explaining what we&#39;re able to come up with to try and help folks be able to stay in their homes?</td>

                <td>Thank you, Chair. Thank you, Committee. My name is Morena Zelaya. I am Housing Policy Coordinator, and I am also staff to the Condo Review Board. Excuse me. So tonight, we&#39;re going to be speaking to you about the recommendations resulting from the work of the Anti-Disbasement Task Force and the Condo Ordinance Working Group that was convened earlier this year. Next slide, please. so first i&#39;d like to start off by thanking um the working group members which included counselor scott um two members of the condo review board our vice chair kate byrne and our alternate member uh jennifer solis uh brendan ellen joe and i were also staff um and as brendan said earlier it was a very collaborative effort and i&#39;m um i&#39;m proud of the effort that we put into it and sort of the thoughtfulness that everyone brought to the table and think that we&#39;ve got hopefully some good recommendations for you all. Next slide, please. So tonight we&#39;re gonna be proposing two separate changes to the ordinance. This is gonna relate to the permits that are issued for units that are currently rented or the last use was as rentals. So this is going to, the proposed ordinance changes are an extended notice period for vacant units that were last used as rentals and increased relocation payments for any current tenants who are living in units while conversion is occurring. Next slide, please. So just to give a quick overview of the condo ordinance, so people have the background. Like I mentioned earlier, we&#39;ve got two sort of tenants, two types of permits that we issue, that the board issues, a rental conversion permit and a non-rental conversion permit. Non-rental conversion permits are permits issued for owner-occupied units or units that were formerly owner-occupied or things where... Yeah, that&#39;s basically what it is. So we&#39;re not really going to touch those because we&#39;re not making any changes for that. We&#39;re solely dealing with tenanted or formerly tenanted units. For currently tenanted units, the process is generally that owners must serve tenants with a written notice on a form provided by the board. The notice period for tenants begins as of receiving that notice of intent form. The tenants&#39; protections, however, vest when an owner forms an intent, and so intent plays a big role in the ordinance. And so that can be a different date than from when they get the form, because the owner decides that they&#39;re going to convert before they actually start collecting all of the forms that they&#39;ve got to provide to the tenants. So when tenants protections vest, they are entitled to a one year or five year notice period, a right to purchase their unit for the as is price of the unit, a relocation payment if they vacate within their notice period and the current amounts are on the screen there. And they&#39;ve got a right to actually cancel their lease or move out with 30 days notice to their tenants. now if you&#39;ve got vacant units where the last use was rental then owners have to notify those tenants that had lived there within the previous 12 months and they receive a written notice just a letter nothing from the nothing that&#39;s on a board form or anything and then the one year notice period in that case begins when the board issues a preliminary permit And just to be clear, the notice period is a waiting period. So you get a preliminary permit and then you have to wait for however long that notice period is before you can get a final permit. And then you&#39;re not able to sell your units until you&#39;ve got that final permit. So next slide, please. So the main issue that we&#39;ve come across is that the condo conversion laws generally protect current tenants. So as I mentioned earlier, the ordinance is triggered when the owner has an intent to convert. So this is difficult to establish. Owners often seek to maximize their profits from sales. But just because you vacated a building in order to sell it, that doesn&#39;t mean that they&#39;re is or is not an intent to convert. So the problem, the hard part that the board has is trying to establish that intent. So what happens is an original owner decides to sell. The original owner opts not to renew a tenant&#39;s leases. And then a purchase and sale will frequently require that the units be vacant at the time of closing. And then the new owner has an intent to convert. And so there&#39;s a one-year notice period to the board, but there&#39;s no tenant protections because the ordinance is treating this as a vacant unit. These tenants have been displaced. Next slide, please. So what we are proposing, two proposals before you tonight, as I said earlier, the relocation payments, we are proposing for those to be increased to $14,000 for tenants that are not entitled to enhanced protections and $18,000 for those that are. So those would be seniors, disabled tenants, or low to moderate income tenants. And then the second proposal is changing the notice period for vacant units that were former rentals to two years instead of one year which is currently what we&#39;ve got in place the goal of which is to encourage property owners to keep their tenants in their units since it would be more beneficial because the tenant notice period is not changing so if you&#39;ve got your tenants they would have generally just the one year if you&#39;ve got a vacant unit that was formerly tenanted then you would have two years so we&#39;re trying to change that calculus um next slide please So we understand that there are pros and cons to taking the two year notice period. We talked about them extensively during the working group. And like I said earlier, we thought that it was beneficial. It could be beneficial to keeping the tenant in their units It would potentially deter emptying out the properties prior to sale and might change that requirement in the purchase and sale agreements. It would grant greater opportunity for tenants to receive an offer to purchase. Not that many tenants have bought their units through the condo ordinance. And then an expanded notice period could provide opportunity for a tenant organizing or a nonprofit to purchase the property in order to restrict it for affordability. And then if the tenants do vacate, they can do so in a more manageable timeline than what generally occurs, which is a month&#39;s notice that a lease isn&#39;t being renewed or an at-will tenant is just being told that they need to vacate. The problem or the cons that we identified were tenant properties are harder to sell, which could increase the costs for development of condo units down the line. Some developers may have the funds to keep properties vacant. So that would mean higher housing costs in the end and units that aren&#39;t being used. And we&#39;ve already got one of the most stringent conversion bylaws in the Commonwealth. And so there&#39;s always the additional aspect of potential for litigation. Next slide, please. And here before you, we&#39;ve got just some data that we compiled about what, how often applications came to us, came to the board vacant prior to the 2019 change that added in the one-year notice period. So as you can see, we have had, it has had an impact, 92% versus 80%, but it&#39;s still, you know, Somerville does not have a vacancy rate of 80%. So obviously, for the most part, applications are coming before us still empty and tenants aren&#39;t generally receiving the protections that they&#39;re entitled to. And additionally, we do have two requests of this committee. We would recommend that the effective date should the amendments be approved, the effective date should be set to October 1st. This will allow staff time to conduct outreach and educate stakeholders on these changes. And then there&#39;s also a typo that we&#39;d like to correct within the ordinance Section 7-64A1A reads a non-tent paying tenant when it should read a non-rent paying tenant. And with that, I think the next slide is just a question slide.</td>

We&#39;re hoping that we change the math when folks are deciding if they&#39;re going to be evicting or emptying out their buildings. We&#39;re hoping that by saying, well, if tenants would only need to stay for a year versus a two-year waiting period, or actually if a tenant vacates earlier, then you can get your final permit earlier. So we&#39;re hoping that the math changes. It&#39;s not so much that we can sort of prevent the evictions themselves, unfortunately. And I&#39;m...</td>

                <td>Yes, thank you for a moment. Again, this is Ellen Chatterjee through the chair. I hope this, okay, Maureen, I wasn&#39;t sure how we were supposed to do this, but I guess I would just add a couple of things to very, very, very right, clearly explain the problem. The current owner evicts. That current owner may not have any intent one way or the other about what the next owner is going to do. Next owner comes in and converts and there&#39;s no sitting tenants. What we hope is by having a two-year period where that new owner purchases, even if the units are building and by saying they have to wait a full two years before they can convert to condominiums, that a number of things would happen. It would change the financial incentives for developers so that first of all, They might decide it&#39;s not in their interest to convert at all because it is now more expensive. There&#39;s a two-year waiting period before they can do that and begin to recoup any of their investment. So there is some disincentive from this to conversion period. The second thing, as Marina said, that I would just again like to point out is by landlords, new landlords and the old landlords have a choice, right? Sometimes they are communication. Sometimes the first landlord knows that the new buyer intends to convert, that there&#39;s conversation about that. But this could create a different kind of incentive so that together it might be more worthwhile for that person to allow that tenant to remain, not to bring that building vacant to us, but to keep that tenant in place and give them that that one year or maybe five years, right, period before they have to relocate. So what this does, we can&#39;t control the, we can&#39;t prevent the sale from one owner to the other. And we can&#39;t change the law to say the new owner is responsible for the old tenants if the old tenants evicted. But what we can do is try to change the financial incentives that really make may make a difference in our ability to get more of these buildings coming to us with tenants in them, as opposed to the first landlord automatically emptying all the buildings in order to sort of get the highest, what they perceive as the highest return on their dollar in that sale, which is typically to develop a vacant, you know, to deliver a vacant building. So we&#39;re trying to use this as a way to change some of the financial incentives that underlie the decisions that are being made when people come before the Condor Review Board.</td>

So I do want to separate the two, even though the two amendments, one came from each, I do want to sort of separate the work. The Anti displacement Task Force did not look into a way to expand the section eight stock i&#39;m not sure and and i&#39;ll let director factor. speak more clearly on this, but we we did. look into potentially the use of Section 8 vouchers in things like our inclusionary units to try to deepen affordability that way, things like that, but we didn&#39;t I&#39;m not sure that we have any control over expanding the stock itself. And my understanding, and again, Director Schachter can correct me if I&#39;m wrong, is that the vouchers themselves, the voucher program is pretty stretched. So I&#39;m not sure how much flexibility there is.</td>

The co-chair who was there in it is somebody who I&#39;m sure has reached out to, if not all of us, many of us with concerns over the Condor Review Board and their ability to actually exercise or help tenants exercise their rights. Um, so there was, I don&#39;t think I can do justice to the breadth of things that were discussed in that committee. Um, but I can say that city staff really did dig in, uh, and, and pursued every wild idea that we could, we could come up with. Um, I&#39;m not sure what the nature of community comment, uh, That was a pretty vague update, Mr. Chair. I don&#39;t see this as anything other than a very simple increase of the relocation costs to reflect the actual cost of relocating and an extension which, from a policy perspective, has a chance of making things better. So I&#39;d be inclined to pass these and just get them out of the box. But, you know, will of the chair.</td>

So let&#39;s see, I&#39;m going to share this document. all right so this is the ordinance can you all see that now is it is it um reasonable size we can see it but i will say you might want to just zoom in a tad bit so we can see the words more clearly how&#39;s that perfect all right so this is actually the marked up version so as you can see no changes for a good bit until we get to 764. And this is changing one year to two years. Here is the, excuse me, here&#39;s the non-tent paying tenant. I think unless the clerk disagrees, I think that is probably a correction that could be made by the clerk&#39;s office without needing to vote. It&#39;s fairly clearly just a typo. And then And just for the members of the public, this is actually the document that&#39;s attached to the item. So folks watching at home can pull this up as well, take a look through the agenda. So here&#39;s the second set of changes as was noted to 18,000 and 14,000 for the relocation payments. I think that was it. Oh, one more. Here&#39;s another, changing the one year to two years. Okay. Yeah, so that&#39;s it. And I think this is relevant to the discussion here because in terms of the actual textual changes, it&#39;s very limited, very straightforward. It&#39;s really just the concept that was presented here. So we heard, Councillor Scott, any other discussion in terms of moving this forward? I&#39;ll just share my thought as chair is, I&#39;m going to stop sharing here if the clerk wants to put the agenda back up. Thank you. You know, Look, I appreciate it, and we often have kept things in committee to give folks a chance to review it and take a look. We&#39;ve been talking about this for many, many, many, many, many months. It was submitted two and a half weeks ago. It won&#39;t be taken up by the council for another week and a half. Actually, is it even longer than that? No, it&#39;s a week and a half. The 10th, I think, of July is the next council meeting. So certainly if there&#39;s an outpouring of concern or substantive issues that are raised, the full council could elect to send it back to committee at that time. But I think there&#39;s also the question of the effective date in that request, which I want to come back to, but I&#39;m not sure I see a... a compelling argument to hold off any further in terms of what we have for us. Councilman Kampen, I see your hand raised.</td>

If there&#39;s a motion, I&#39;ll be voting for it, clearly. The only thing I wanted to say is if we are going to have an effective date of October, and if there is some benefit that I&#39;m not totally understanding of having time for people to try to influence our vote, as long as it&#39;s kind of, I think... hopefully very clear to the staff that this or something extremely close to this will pass when it comes. Um, if that effective date were to stay and we were to pass it in mid August, instead of now, you know, there&#39;s basically no harm, no foul either way. Um, it&#39;s really hard for me to imagine public feedback. That&#39;s going to change my support for this. So in that sense, you know, I, I don&#39;t want to, you know, patronize the public and pretend, right. Like I, I, I value the input of this working group is what I&#39;m saying. But I have certainly been wrong before. And if there is some value that I&#39;m missing and it&#39;s not going to change the time that this actually goes into effect, it&#39;s not the end of the world if we wait until August to take this up. But again, I&#39;m supportive of these changes. Yeah.</td>

                <td>Thank you, Mr. Chair. Let me turn my video on to respect that other people have done so as well and also prove that I do have a face. For the record, legislative and policy analyst Brendan Salisbury, So this has been a thing that has come up before the committee before with regard to the implementation of an effective date on an amendment. And I would like to say that for an amendment such as this in particular, it is extremely difficult to include an effective date. The inclusion of an effective date in the effective date section notwithstanding my opinion on the use of effective date sections in their entirety, is that if we were to say the amendment of X date takes effect on X date, we would eventually have an extremely unwieldy and difficult to parse effective date section. With these text changes where they are as you have noted, very minor text changes within the text. It would be a relatively simple thing to add an effective date if an entire new section was being added or even an entire new subsection. We could say this subsection shall take effect on X date. But where we&#39;re literally changing only a few words throughout the entirety of this ordinance, it would become a very difficult exercise to include the change from one to two years in, you know, subsection A of 764 paragraph one takes effect on October of 2025. So I do want to caution against attempting to make any addition of an effective date on the fly in committee, because it will lead to a bit of a nightmare in terms of drafting.</td>

Mr. Chair, at the risk of showing my bitter experience, we pass laws all the time that don&#39;t get enforced until the administration decides to. I&#39;m thinking of the vacant property ordinance in particular. So if there&#39;s an administrative decision to pause the implementation of this until a certain date, let that be so and let that be a choice that the administration makes. Um, but I, given that, I think very compelling explanation there, uh, my inclination, whenever you feel it&#39;s appropriate is to move, to recommend, uh, the document before us. Thank you, Mr. Chair.</td>

I&#39;d love for the vacant property ordinance to be enforced at some point ever in its many, many years of existence. But alas, here we are. But fair point, I think what I&#39;m inclined to suggest at this stage is that a motion is in order and that in the 10 or so days between now and when the council meets and its final meeting before the recess, you know certainly as always if there are um significant concerns that are that arise that are that are brought to the council&#39;s attention um it&#39;s always uh there&#39;s always the opportunity to uh to send something back to committee um and uh similarly uh in in the meantime if there&#39;s a um a streamlined way without uh you know messing up the batter to, uh, to add an effective date to this. Um, that&#39;s certainly something that we could, um, you know, that, that we could, we could take up at the, uh, at the meeting on Thursday. Um, I happen to, uh, have a close connection with the person who will be presiding over that meeting. And I can tell you that I think he&#39;d be willing to allow it. Um, so, uh, so it&#39;s fine with me, um, you know, want to get things right. And I don&#39;t have, I, I, you know, Other than just wanting to get this in place, if there&#39;s a significant reason to do that, that&#39;s fine, but definitely don&#39;t want to mess up things. So I see Councillor Ewen Campin and Scott.</td>

It&#39;s never been an issue in the past that I&#39;m aware of. I certainly respect that drafting might be less aesthetically clean or something, but Isn&#39;t having an effective date for a series of amendments like a completely de rigueur thing that is commonly done in ordinance drafting across the country?

Peter Haslund, companion item, I believe that was this is actually the initial discussion if i&#39;m correct so. Peter Haslund, I would recommend that we place this one on file if that&#39;s if the park would confirm that&#39;s the right disposition of that really. I guess it&#39;s an order, so yeah.

So that brings us to item four in the agenda, which is 24-0256, that the city solicitor discussed with this council whether elements of Boston&#39;s proposed ordinance for road safety and accountability for delivery providers could be used to disincentivize mopeds on the community path. This is apparently the disincentivization meeting tonight. Um, So this was a suggestion that was put forth by Councillor Burnley a little while back, a good while back actually. And I wanted to get it on the agenda so we have a chance to kind of queue up the conversation. I know that there are, I know we have folks from the law department here that may be able to speak to some of the questions and issues, but certainly there&#39;s no expectation that there&#39;s a fully fledged sort of response or proposal here. I wanted to, kind of you know have the discussion on this and then you know in hopes that perhaps over the recess we could you know folks could kind of put pen to paper and when we when we come back at the end of the summer if there is anywhere to any improvements we can make here then maybe have some some concrete suggestions on that so I just want to I want to say that at the outset so there&#39;s no you know expectations that we&#39;re going to have you know a fully fledged response or proposal but Just want to get the conversation started, if you will. So with that context in mind, Mr. Salisbury, you mentioned that you have some background or some input that you&#39;d like to share with the committee on this item. Is that correct?</td>

So through you to the committee, I did want to flag just one thing, that in review of the ordinance that was passed in Boston, I did want to highlight that while Councillor Burnley&#39;s intent does appear to be about disincentivizing mo community path it&#39;s my opinion that the ordinance that was passed in boston and that was initially proposed would would not accomplish that um the ordinance that was passed and initially proposed in boston uh was essentially to establish accountability um for uh all delivery drivers in the event of a crash um so requiring the use of insurance I obviously cannot speak to the legality of that. I know that members of the law department are here and may be able to. But I do have... I&#39;ve done a glancing analysis of this, and I&#39;d be interested to know how things are shaking out in Boston. They do, of course, have a significantly more substantial apparatus in place to make this work. But I&#39;d be very interested to know how this is going in Boston, because I... To be frank, this looks like a logistical nightmare.</td>

So there would be a lot of issues about what if anything we could do, particularly unilaterally without MBTA. The good news is we have a lease for the community path with the MBTA and the lease prohibits motorized vehicles. and mopeds are not currently allowed on the community path. That&#39;s my understanding. So I&#39;m not quite sure how the Boston Ordinance and what the Somerville goal on the community path mesh together because the Boston Ordinance is designed more to deal with insurance for people delivery services so that when there is a problem or an accident that they&#39;re covered or more importantly, the people that are harmed have coverage that they can go to. Whereas I believe the question about the community path is not wanting to have motorized vehicles. And apparently my understanding is there is also a sign that says no motorized vehicles. That&#39;s the extent of my knowledge.</td>

So I think, look, I mean, the language of this item is fairly clear in terms of the intent, in terms of... some type of motorized vehicle on the community path. There is also some nuance, if I understand it correctly, and the letter, the Boston ordinance, at least the letter we have from the mayor here, lists when referencing the 311 calls, lists mopeds, motorbikes, scooters, and e-bikes. And so my understanding is that the state legal structure does recognize a distinction between certain types of vehicles that have some sort of a motor, right? And there&#39;s categories or classes of e-bikes at some point moving up towards what we would call a moped or a motorbike. First, is that right? Do I have that correct, Attorney Amara?</td>

So to Attorney Amara, I would love to see if you have a citation on which modes of conveyance are considered to be motorized vehicles for the purposes of that law. I&#39;m sure of course, electric wheelchairs would be excluded as well, but I just, you know how much I love a good citation. So if you could pass that along, I&#39;d appreciate it. And you know what, I&#39;d also be happy to take a look at that lease for the community path to see if anything tickles my fancy in terms of ideas we can implement. That said, Mr. Chair, I think we&#39;re having the discussion that&#39;s being requested. It sounds like the answer to me is that the Boston ordinance doesn&#39;t have any particular relevance here, but that there&#39;s some good ideas for signage, which in my opinion would be outside of the scope of this order and would be best handled with a council order at our next meeting.</td>

                <td>Thank you, Mr. Chair. Okay, thank you, Councilor Scott. So, yeah, I think, look, to Mr. Salisbury&#39;s points initially, if there&#39;s some feedback in terms of the experience here at Boston and something we may be able to do that we think makes sense as far as creating an insurance system, then we could certainly consider taking that to me that aspect of the request up and But if that is all that&#39;s in the Boston Ordinance, then it probably doesn&#39;t quite get us to the suggested intent here of the community path. So I&#39;m inclined to leave this one to committee. And then, you know, Attorney Amara, thank you for listening to our questions and requests. If there&#39;s some feedback or, Scott, you want to... work with the law department over the recess to take a peek at those documents and see what we might be able to do in terms of some signs, then I do agree that, you know, if so, a separate order would be appropriate to, you know, or I mean, frankly, we don&#39;t necessarily even need an order, just do it. But if you want to have the discussion about what makes sense, you know, that is something that I would think could probably be taken up in, you know, traffic and parking or another committee. Okay. since it&#39;s really outside of the legislative piece of the equation. So any further discussion on this item? Okay. As I said, I&#39;m inclined to leave it committee just in case there&#39;s something that folks want to pursue once we come out of the recess. If not, it can certainly be marked work complete. But as I said, we were going to start the conversation on it. I&#39;m inclined to stick to my word. and leave it in committee for a future discussion, whatever direction that might go. And so that brings us to the items five and six on the agenda. I would thank you, Attorney Amar. I appreciate your input on that one. The last two items here I put on the agenda so that they can be placed on file or marked complete. So 25-007 is Chris Duan submitting comments regarding the Urban Forestry Committee recommendations. Those recommendations have been codified and passed. We just must have missed putting that one on the agenda as a cleanup item. So I will suggest that we place that on file. And then item 25-0154 is an order that the Director of Economic Development presented this Council a plan to ensure compliance with Section 8-18 of the Code of Ordinances. This is sort of a companion item to an item that was discussed in the Licensing Commission last week, basically the exact same topic. Council Burnley, who put this item in, of course, chairs the Committee on Licenses and Permits. And we had a lengthy discussion with the administration on the status of that ordinance. And so I would encourage folks to take a look at that if you&#39;re interested in it. But I think there&#39;s certainly, I serve on licenses and permits. So my view is that that discussion effectively covered the entirety of the substance of this. And so I&#39;m inclined to mark it work complete, unless there&#39;s any objections. Any discussion on this disposition of those two items? All right, seeing none, that brings us to the end of our agenda. Is that correct, Madam Clerk?</td>

With that, Councilor Scott moves for adjournment. Would the clerk please call the roll on adjournment?</td>
