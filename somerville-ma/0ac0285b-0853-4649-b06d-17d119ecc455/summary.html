<h3 id="6e13-order-by-councillor-scott-25-1189">6E13 Order by Councillor Scott (25-1189)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Subject:</strong> An order by Councillor Scott that the Executive Office Administration personal services salaries line be reduced by $186,744 in the FY26 budget.</li>
<li><strong>Motion:</strong> Councilor Wilson moved to sever item 6E13 from the report of the Finance Committee and take it up separately for a vote.</li>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Councilor Davis:</strong> Disappointed by the Mayor's statement, arguing the cut was about the position, not the individual. Stated the Council's power to cut dollars from the budget is limited, and if it corresponds to a position, that's how it works. Believed the position was not appropriate or necessary. Clarified that the Charter-created position is different from the current one.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Ewen-Campen:</strong> Agreed the Council can cut positions but emphasized the need for deliberation. Expressed concern about the lack of discussion on Tuesday night and the psychological impact on city staff morale.</li>

<li><strong>Councilor Scott:</strong> Glad for reconsideration, emphasizing the role of a deliberative body. Criticized the Mayor's statement as "corrosive" and disrespectful to the legislative branch.</li>
<li><strong>Council President Pineda-Newfeld:</strong> Shared her experience as a city contractor during COVID, highlighting the anxiety city staff face during budget season. Argued the cut felt personal and was not reallocated to other priorities. Emphasized the Council's role in asking questions and understanding staff roles, not just cutting jobs.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor McLaughlin:</strong> Defended his daily work for the city and the need for accountability.</li>

<li><strong>Summer NOVA Items:</strong> All four amendments were approved by the committee.<ul>
<li><strong>Arts and Innovation Subarea (Master Plan Development Overlay District):</strong> Discussed thoroughly, with a motion by Councilor Ewen-Campen to guarantee affordable housing. Concerns about transportation, parking, and traffic were weighed. The committee voted 5-0 in favor, based on the merits of the zoning.</li>
<li><strong>Other Three Amendments:</strong> Approved again after being sent back to committee, with no changes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Citywide Zoning Proposals:</strong> Samantha Carr (Land Use Analyst) and Dan Bartman (Director of Planning) updated the committee. More housing is being built in UR and NR districts (as-of-right) than MR districts (main streets). Concern was raised that making MR as-of-right might jeopardize inclusionary zoning. This item will be continued.</li>
<li><strong>Building Official to Waive Certain Dimensional Standards for Means of Egress:</strong> Councilor Wilson made an amendment to strike "possible" and insert "feasible without undue financial hardship" to ensure stricter application of the waiver.</li>

<li><strong>Councilor Scott:</strong> Appreciated the Land Use Committee's work and the process of taking items back to committee for modifications.</li>

</li>
<li><strong>Outcome:</strong> The committee report was <strong>approved</strong>, and item 6F5 (Yimby-Dormer) was <strong>sent back to committee</strong>.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Subject:</strong> An amendment to articles 8 and 12 of the zoning ordinance to establish a new Arts and Innovation Subarea of the Master Planned Development Overlay District.</li>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Councilor Davis:</strong> Acknowledged ongoing communication and valid questions. Emphasized the overlay district as key to comfort, providing oversight and checkpoints from the Planning Board and Urban Design Commission, and additional public input opportunities.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Ewen-Campen:</strong> Stated he would vote yes, calling it a "tough vote." Recalled the process starting two years ago with developer withdrawal due to community pushback. Highlighted improvements: minimized traffic issues (low parking ratios, free shuttles, aggressive mobility management with stop points), required residential component, and community benefits agreement (project labor agreement, art space, community center, financial contributions to nonprofits). Thanked the Union Square Neighborhood Council for their "extraordinary" work.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Wilson:</strong> Acknowledged neighbor concerns but noted that the integrity of the USNC vote was not questioned. Satisfied with changes to address height, lodging use, and traffic. Believed the developer's long-term leasing strategy aligns their interests with the neighborhood's.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Mbah:</strong> Thanked the Land Use Committee and acknowledged community engagement. Supported the overlay zoning as representing "the best of what community driven planning can look like." Highlighted the community benefits agreement (local jobs, youth pipelines, art space, climate tech cluster) and supported an independent oversight committee.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Scott:</strong> Praised the Land Use Committee's impressive work and the decade-long organizing effort. Called the outcome "absolute wins for the community" and a new standard for development.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor McLaughlin:</strong> Supported the item, acknowledging the hard work of ward councilors and the neighborhood council. Stated the community's ballot referendum did not influence his vote. Emphasized setting a new standard for development where developers meet the city's standards and provide tangible community benefits.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Clingan:</strong> Agreed with previous comments, thanking the Land Use Committee and the community for their significant input, which led to a "great deal."</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Sait:</strong> Weighed pros and cons, satisfied with mobility department presentations on traffic mitigation and the community benefits agreement. Highlighted the amendment requiring residential housing.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Burnley:</strong> Recalled his initial conversation with the developer three years ago, where he set the standard: "get the community on your side." Stated he would honor his promise to support what the community fought for.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Strezo:</strong> Driven by the community-led process, CBA, and PLA. Confirmed with Director Galgani that shuttles provided by Rafi Properties would be available to all Somerville residents.</li>
