And Madison will be doing some slides. While that&#39;s happening, this is Adam Dash, 48 Grove Street in Somerville, attorney for Couples Bagels Somerville, LLC. Farzad, Julie, and Ali Gorby are the managers. They are all here tonight, the family. Madison Hill from Colwell Group, the architects, is here, as is Jared Walsh, the civil engineer from Bowler Engineering. uh regarding uh this project um the clients are going to be leasing 54a elm street to open a bakery coffee shop or cafe use namely couples bagels which will be a second location for their famous brookline location uh 54a elm street is a storefront that&#39;s attached to the 54 elm street property which is a four-unit mixed-use building which has been vacant since the building was renovated and expanded seven or so years ago. If you go back far enough, you may recall there was a convenience store in this site on this location way back when, but it&#39;s been vacant for a very long time. It&#39;s in the neighborhood resident zoning district and the small business overlay, so this use requires a special permit. No other works being done to the building exterior rather than signage outdoor seating. There will be no parking on site, nor is any required Madison. You want to show some slides? It&#39;s not a terribly slide heavy presentation, but.</td>

                <td>Yes, absolutely. Thank you, Adam. And thank you. Madam chair. I&#39;m going to go ahead and share my screen. I think I just need to send a quick request. Awesome. And as Adam mentioned, I am with the Coldwell Group. So we are the architects working with the Gorbys for Couples Bakery. We are going to show some existing site photos. This is just a site plan showing where those photos are coming from. As you can see, and as Adam had mentioned, we&#39;re not going to be doing any exterior site improvements besides signage, potentially on the windows and the awnings. The entrance to the building is staying as is. Again, all the exterior siding staying as is. So this is just showing as we&#39;re approaching the entrance. An overall view of the building. The side view here going down Mossland is where we&#39;re proposing to include exterior seating for Couples Bagels. And then this site plan is showing Just the overall site improvement. So we&#39;re proposing a walk-in cooler for the bakery. It&#39;s going to be as close to the building, back of the building as possible. And we are going to be screening it with lattice fencing, just extending the existing lattice fencing that is there. We also have a proposed dumpster container that will be enclosed with the chain link fence and privacy slots, as well as short-term and long-term bicycle parking. And then up alongside this side of the building is the proposed outdoor seating. When we&#39;re going into the interior of the building, nothing&#39;s changing to the existing basement plan. It&#39;s just gonna be used as existing or additional storage for the bakery itself. The first floor plan, utilizing the existing ADA restroom. And then we&#39;re just going to improve it with a kitchen, ordering counter. And there is 14 indoor seating arrangements, some high tops, bistro tables, a bar counter. And then again, the 10 outdoor proposed seating. And then finally, we&#39;re just showing some elevations of how we&#39;re proposing to extend the lattice fencing, something similar to the white lattice fencing that is already existing and then chain link privacy fencing for the dumpster enclosure.</td>

It&#39;s very narrow. There&#39;s 2 turning lanes and it&#39;s not really built to accommodate the type of traffic that goes down that goes down that street to get onto some real. There&#39;s a bike lane that runs on Cedar street. and ends but then people go down cedar onto mossland and very often what happens is and i know because i have to do this sometimes it&#39;s there&#39;s so much traffic on mossland that it&#39;s pretty unsafe to drive to ride your bike through that street and people will go on the sidewalk briefly before they get to the stoplight um but sometimes i got to do it just because that&#39;s what it&#39;s like in the morning on that road so while you&#39;re considering the seating that&#39;s going to be on mossland hopefully a cyclist is going to be smart enough not to put their bike on there if it&#39;s crowded with people but you could have a liability issue on your hand if somebody does decide to go on a cycle on the sidewalk just for that brief moment to avoid the traffic there um so i want the outdoor seating but John Potter, You know, go there in the morning, when there&#39;s a shower and there&#39;s a lot of people on their bikes on a nice day like today and see what you think about that.

I would just like to say I&#39;ve seen that corner evolve over the years, and it&#39;s much, much more attractive. It&#39;s nice. That little business is going to be, especially the 54L beside it. There&#39;s A and B, I think, on the address. The front lawn always looks nice. They&#39;re keeping the property. And that&#39;s inviting for people who want to go and sit down and have a cup of coffee and a bagel or a tea or something. my question i have a couple of questions about the back of the building because i believe it&#39;s the opening after the garage behind the building that you&#39;re going to put your air conditioning out there and your trash and your uh is it a race a refrigerator going outside</td>

And it will include on the first floor a half bath and it&#39;s really the expansion of a family bath here so at present it it includes this area and it&#39;s a very small cramped bathroom so What the clients would like to do is extend it three feet, three and a half feet outwards and to include laundry facilities, a full tub with shower, and then obviously a toilet and sink. And so what happens on the first floor is there&#39;s this space here, which they&#39;d like to put in a half bath. to serve guests who come and visit on the first floor so they don&#39;t have to go up to the second floor. So this is the proposal. And as far as I understand, sorry. So it&#39;s basically adding two floors with a foundation. not a full basement, but a crawl space. And so here is here is the elevation from the street. This is the addition. And here is the elevation from the neighbor side to the east, I think. And it only goes up the two stories with the basement the crawl space foundation um so we&#39;re looking for relief because it seems to with the when you add the uh two JoAnne Hanrahan- When you add the setbacks because this is this was a building that was built way before there were setbacks it is oddly situated such that the this. JoAnne Hanrahan- This corner is very close to the property line. JoAnne Hanrahan- causing this to be so, so when you add the two, I think it. It comes out to just over the 12 feet that&#39;s allotted. When we add this in.</td>

Literal enforcement would cause financial other hardships by prohibiting additions with bathrooms to meet required clearances of 30 inches clear. And with regard to the question of detriment to the public good, the desired relief does not cause substantial detriment to the public good, nor detracts from the intent and purpose of the Somerville zoning ordinance. Because the required relief is only six inches, which would be very barely perceptible to abutting neighbors and the proposed addition is only two stories, rather than the full three stories of the dwelling, making it less visually impactful.</td>

The code mandates that all signs, all these type of blade signs be less than 10 feet from the principal entrance. As we can see here, we are coming very close to that. This lot is on the corner. And at the elevation that our customer would like to put it on, the sign would not be able to be installed because there&#39;s windows all within 10 feet of the principal entrance here. And since this is a corner lot, we do have this nice corner that we can install the sign on. And there&#39;s a little bit of confusion as to where the principal entrance starts. as this is a double door um i couldn&#39;t find it stated in the code where that is but uh from this corner here and uh this projection here um going straight out from that it&#39;s about 10 foot two i think from the corner to the edge here is according to my survey about 134 inches um the door is 76 wide And there&#39;s a little alcove in here, which may or may not be added in the calculation. But we&#39;re proposing to install this to get increased visibility from pedestrians.

So I think you&#39;re suffering from coming after some of the four actors, specifically the chase sign. That blue neon sign, you can see more than a block and a half away and lights up the entire square at night. I just don&#39;t believe that people are wandering around and need to be able to see a sign more than a block away. So I think, I realize this is probably into some zoning details, but I think the brightness Justin Delacruz, makes a big difference, I think the scorching blue light that comes from the chase sign is probably an example of something that does not work and is unnecessary. Justin Delacruz, I don&#39;t think most of the other signs that that criteria that really detracts from the evening visibility in the square. Justin Delacruz, So I don&#39;t know for factoring in brightness, but I do think that is a concern for the neighborhood.</td>

I&#39;m just trying to understand a little bit about maintaining some consensus consistency and fairness to the businesses around here who do have a right to do the best they can advertise their business but also um keep things consistent and not give one an advantage over the other so do you guys remember anything from any of the past cases as to why we allow some of this and others we didn&#39;t I don&#39;t know off the top of my head um and also don&#39;t we have a committee that approves the signage</td>

And they would have that relief granted by the ZBA and then all other things outlined in the ordinance they would have to comply to. Like we do have lighting that they have to abide by, lighting standards to prevent light pollution. I&#39;m not sure how ISD enforces that exactly.

I&#39;m not very convinced by the argument that the other frontage of the store and the windows are making it so that&#39;s unique that they need to put that sign at the end. You know, if anything, you&#39;re on the corner a lot, so you actually have a little bit more of a view for people to see it. I&#39;m undecided at this point.

The placement of the sign is partly the merchant&#39;s preference about where they want to position it in terms of the height. Certainly to raise it just slightly could go on the facade rather than interfering with the windows. I&#39;m not sure that that difference in height would make that much difference for visibility for foot traffic, which seems to be the primary concern for placing the blade sign. And I take seriously the point in the staff memo that if we start granting hardship variances on these small variations in signage what&#39;s the what is the sign ordinance for um we want some consistency as zach says many of these signs may be non-conforming previously installed signs i don&#39;t know if the city goes goes around and tries to get them to change to conform um i mean it is partly a reflection of Well, it&#39;s not so new of an ordinance anymore, but still it&#39;s only four years old. So I am, like Zach, uncertain about this. I think the owner could make an adjustment and make it a conforming sign and everybody would be happy and don&#39;t need a hardship variance then.</td>

Karen Hollweg, Is for security dama. Karen Hollweg, it&#39;s up in the signage band, I think that specific issue with the goodwill store that we&#39;re looking at is they have a double wide frontage that a lot of the other storefronts don&#39;t have, which is you know, made their. the metrics of where their front door is a little bit more complicated. But that said, I do think that the blade sign is accomplishable without a hardship variance up in the signage band if they really want one.</td>

Karen Hollweg, i&#39;m not in favor of this. i believe that sometimes you get a good idea to do something and it keeps growing and growing and growing and then you have all this signage all over the place that you can&#39;t they&#39;re out doing one another and as joe k said you know we want a certain amount of illumination at night especially davis square know you got a good crowd going through it&#39;s a little later square than maybe uh other squares in the city like a teal square or you know what a ball square but um i think after a while it&#39;s like sign pollution like noise pollution the lighting&#39;s not there there are some residents still around in the neighborhood they might want to look out a window they might live upstairs over a business um um and i think if you folks thought you were going to come forward with this sign, this blade sign, after coming forward with the goodwill, investing all that time and money, I think it&#39;s too much signage. I&#39;m not in favor of it. And that&#39;s how I&#39;d be voting. Does anybody else have any other comments? And again, we must reiterate the severity of a hardship variance Sometimes we&#39;ve come along now with some of the new ordinances and it was under the old and what&#39;s the new and all that jazz and we&#39;ve been a little bit, we tweak it a little bit when we feel we can and we feel it is a hardship for the family or the business owner or what have you. But I mean, let&#39;s face it, everyone knows Goodwill. They&#39;ve been there 34 years. they&#39;ve got a beautiful corner with a beautiful signage on the top the sign is beautiful did a wonderful job the coloring everything looks very very nice if this was down further in the center and not on the corner so much that might be a consideration but right now i think it&#39;s very attractive it&#39;s very professional looking and it makes the store inviting so uh without further ado does anybody else have any comments they want to add is everybody ready to vote tonight yes um Brian if you&#39;d like to make the motion um uh would you like to phrase it as approve or disapprove well I&#39;d do it as approved I would do it as approved And we can vote accordingly because somebody might say yay or nay. You know what I&#39;m saying? So I think we have to do it as approved.</td>

We were very selfless. Thank you. And is there anybody has any, so that&#39;s it. Is there anybody else has any comments as we go forward? I want you to know me sitting back as the chair, you&#39;re all starting to speak up and get more involved and I appreciate it. because it&#39;s very hard for an applicant to come forward and hear our yay or nay, and they really didn&#39;t hear us talking about it. And I think it&#39;s good that we all participate in the conversation and how we come to our conclusion. So thank you for stepping up. You guys have been doing much, speaking up more and I like it.
