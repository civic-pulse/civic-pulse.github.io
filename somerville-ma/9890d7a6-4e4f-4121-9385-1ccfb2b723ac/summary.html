<h3 id="4-orders-resolutions">4. Orders &amp; Resolutions</h3>
<h3 id="41-order-by-councilor-strezo">4.1 Order by Councilor Strezo</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> That this council discuss the Somerville Special Education Parents Advisory Council (CPAC) report sent to the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE) in response to the upcoming DESE District Review of Somerville Public Schools for the 2025-2026 school year.</li>
<li><strong>Recusal:</strong> Councilor Davis recused himself due to an immediate family member working in a school with out-of-district placements. Vice President Mbah presided over this item.</li>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Councilor Strezo:</strong><ul>
<li>Explained her motivation for the order, stemming from her role on the Construction Advisory Committee (CAC) for the Winter Hill Innovation School and Brown School.</li>
<li>Expressed concern that special needs families and children, including those in the AIM program for autistic children at Winter Hill, were not adequately included in CAC discussions regarding school design and consolidation.</li>
<li>Cited an example of a kindergartner at Healy School with undiagnosed autism experiencing behavioral issues due to sensory overload in the cafeteria, highlighting the need for intentional spaces for children with special needs.</li>
<li>Emphasized that school decisions are "family decisions," "future of Somerville decisions," and "child decisions," not solely financial or infrastructure decisions.</li>
<li>Introduced Liz Eldridge, Chair of Somerville CPAC, to speak on their report.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Liz Eldridge (Chair, Somerville Special Education Parents Advisory Council - CPAC):</strong><ul>
<li>Provided context for the 25-page report submitted to DESE, prompted by DESE's notification of a district review to assess equity and quality of education for all students.</li>
<li>Stated the report ensures family and educator voices are heard, based on district data, public records, and extensive testimony.</li>
<li>Highlighted key findings:<ul>
<li>Somerville Special Education was designated "needs assistance" by DESE in early May 2025 due to noncompliance and MCAS scores.</li>
<li>A significant gap exists between the district's stated vision of equity/inclusion and the reality for students with disabilities, with legally required services often missing, delayed evaluations, and IEPs based on staffing shortages rather than student needs (which is illegal).</li>
<li>Students with disabilities comprise over 20% (1,070 students) of the student population.</li>
<li>2024 MCAS data: Only 12% of students with disabilities (grades 3-8) were proficient in English Language Arts (vs. 46% general education peers); 10% proficient in Math (vs. 39% general education peers). This means nearly 9 out of 10 students with disabilities are not meeting grade-level expectations.</li>
<li>Root causes are structural: understaffing, lack of training, inconsistent school-level planning, communication challenges, weak multi-tiered system of support, and budgets failing to prioritize legally mandated services.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Called for corrective action:<ul>
<li>Ensure every student receives legally entitled education and support (Individuals with Disabilities Education Act and Massachusetts regulations).</li>
<li>IEPs must be based on student needs and fully implemented, requiring adequate funding, qualified staff, timely evaluations, and service delivery.</li>
<li>Create inclusive classrooms and buildings, staff co-teachers, provide paraprofessionals and specialist support, and train general education teachers in inclusive practices.</li>
<li>Meaningfully engage families and CPAC, as required by state law, and foster a culture of accountability, transparency, and inclusion.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Emphasized that the issue is systemic, not individual teachers or families, and called for the DESE review to be a turning point.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Action:</strong> Placed on file. Councilor Strezo requested colleagues review the report.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="42-order-by-councilor-strezo">4.2 Order by Councilor Strezo</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> That the Commissioner of Public Works provide information regarding the installation, safety, and accessibility of a railing on the concrete stairs between the play structures and the soccer field at the Winter Hill Community Innovation School playground.</li>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong> Councilor Strezo requested referral to committee.</li>
<li><strong>Action:</strong> Referred to School Buildings, Facilities, and Maintenance Committee.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="43-order-by-councilor-mbah">4.3 Order by Councilor Mbah</h3>

<li><strong>Description:</strong> That the city clerk implement the hiring practices detailed within for positions in the city council and city clerk departments.</li>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong><ul>

<li>Personnel Department, City Clerk, and City Council President to develop implementation guidelines (outreach, compliance, equity training).</li>
<li>Annual report from Personnel Department on implementation, compliance, and outcomes (demographic data).</li>
<li>Policy to be consistent with equal opportunity laws, not establishing quotas or unlawful preferences.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Requested referral to committee for further discussion.</li>

<li><strong>Item 25-1373:</strong> That the City of Somerville hereby accepts the provisions of Chapter 53, Section 18B of the Massachusetts General Laws.</li>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Councilor Scott:</strong><ul>
<li>Clarified that without accepting this provision, the city cannot legally spend money on a citywide mailer to inform residents about ballot questions.</li>
<li>Supported the measure for increased voter information, despite logistical concerns.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Davis:</strong><ul>
<li>Supported the principle of providing information but expressed concern that it is too late for the current election cycle due to timelines and early voting.</li>
<li>Suggested acting on this for future years and referring it back to committee.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Mbah:</strong><ul>
<li>Acknowledged the oversight in not adopting this during the charter review process.</li>
<li>Introduced Harriet Randvig, a constituent, to speak on the policy's intent.</li>

<li>Expressed concern about the implications of not adopting it for voters.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Harriet Randvig (5 Leicester Terrace, Somerville):</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Summary:</strong> Emphasized the need for accessible information beyond websites, suggesting printed copies in public places (libraries, City Hall) and large print/embossed copies. Stated the website is not fully accessible to her as a blind computer user. Highlighted the difficulty of voting without understanding legalese.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Councilor McLaughlin:</strong><ul>
<li>Announced the charter passed the Senate and awaits the governor's signature.</li>
<li>Clarified that incorporating MGL Chapter 53, Section 18B into the charter itself would not have been appropriate.</li>
<li>Expressed concern about rushing the decision and potential "mistakes" given the upcoming preliminary and general elections.</li>
<li>Supported sending it back to committee for further review.</li>
<li>Noted the new charter is in plain language and available online at SomervilleMA.gov/charterreview.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Councilor Wilson:</strong><ul>
<li>Affirmed universal support for transparency and voter information.</li>
<li>Stated the <strong>$40,000</strong> cost is not a primary concern, but feasibility and logistics are.</li>
<li>Supported the idea of a later start date for the provision, possibly for future charter amendments.</li>
<li>Expressed concern about rushing and "getting it wrong."</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Mbah:</strong> Noted the imperfect but improving implementation of Braille voter guides.<ul>
<li>Emphasized the need to understand legal implications to avoid "undue burden" or "unintended consequences."</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Liaison Radazzi:</strong><ul>
<li>Affirmed the city's desire for an informed electorate.</li>
<li>Stated the city is open to continued discussion on adopting the statute.</li>

<li>Emphasized the goal of using a variety of methods and neutral, plain language summaries.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Mbah:</strong> Suggested robocalls and text messages in multiple languages to reach those not typically accessing websites.</li>
<li><strong>Bev Schwartz (Charter Committee Member):</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Summary:</strong> Stated five charter committee members are volunteering for outreach. Suggested the city could at minimum robo-call or email a link to the actual charter language. Emphasized the extensive work on the charter and the importance of it not failing due to a technicality.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Wilson:</strong> Thanked the state delegation for their work on the charter's passage.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Action:</strong> Referred back to committee (Legislative Matters).</li>
