Highlighted the dispute with Republic Services, the second-largest waste disposal unit in the country, owned by Bill Gates, with the CEO earning 170 times more than the average trash collector.

<li><strong>Speaker:</strong> Bridget Quinn (Legislative Director, Teamsters Joint Council 10 New England) – Summarized that Local 25 represents 450 Republic Services workers. Demands include higher wages, affordable health insurance, and safe working conditions. Stated Republic Services has refused to bargain in good faith, causing strikes in 14 communities.

<li><strong>Councilor Strezo:</strong> Signed on as co-sponsor. Commended Teamsters Local 25, stating the Council stands in solidarity.

<ul>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> Resolution condemning Harvard's attack on its graduate student union.</li>
<li><strong>Motion:</strong> Councilor Burnley moved to replace the item with amended language.</li>
<li><strong>Amended Language (Read by Clerk):</strong><ul>
<li>"Whereas education, research, and academic inquiry are values intimately connected to the lives, careers, and passions of Somervillians, and whereas the Trump administration has targeted education and research, including grants, funding, and academic freedom at Harvard University, and whereas Harvard University employs many residents of Somerville, and whereas labor unions play a critical role in workplace and economic justice, and whereas Harvard University is attempting to strip union protections away from workers who are in tenuous positions in science research, including by removing hundreds of students from the Harvard Graduate Student Union, now therefore be it resolved that the Somerville City Council strongly opposes these actions by Harvard, is opposed to all forms of union busting, and urges Harvard administrators to undo these actions, and be it further resolved that Somerville urges Harvard administration to seriously engage with the demands of the Harvard Graduate Students Union on issues from fair pay to protections from harassment and discrimination to resources for non-citizens, and be it further resolved that a copy of this resolution be transmitted to Harvard University administration and president."</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Discussion on Amended Language:</strong> Approved.</li>
<li><strong>Discussion on Resolution:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Councilor Burnley:</strong> Emphasized the "disturbing and frankly disgusting actions" by Harvard, attempting to remove 973 workers from their union by arguing they are not workers. Stated this is dangerous and existential for all workers, as it degrades the dignity of labor. Accused Harvard of trying to bankrupt the union by cutting dues.</li>
<li><strong>Speaker:</strong> Dorothy Manovich (Somerville Resident, Harvard Graduate Student Union Member) – Stated her union has enabled her to live a good life in Somerville, providing dental surgery reimbursement, protections from overwork, harassment, and discrimination. Highlighted that Harvard is attempting to strip union rights from 973 workers and partially from an additional 1,000, concentrated in STEM fields already under stress. Called Harvard's actions "pretty explicitly illegal." Explained that if Harvard succeeds, these workers will lose wage protections, harassment/discrimination protections, and access to emergency funds for healthcare, dental, and childcare. Stated the union relies on dues for operations and Harvard's actions aim to weaken it. Called for Harvard to recognize these workers and for community support.</li>
<li><strong>Co-sponsors:</strong> Councillors Wilson, McLaughlin, Scott, Strezo, Mbah, Davis.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Mbah:</strong> Thanked Councilor Burnley and Ms. Manovich for leadership. Shared his experience as a union member in grad school. Emphasized the importance of fighting for workers' rights.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Wilson:</strong> Criticized Harvard for taking advantage of Trump-era labor rollbacks. Called academia's exploitation of student labor "disgusting" and "infuriating," with unionization being the best antidote.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Scott:</strong> Expressed dismay at the need for this conversation. Urged Harvard to de-escalate conflict, stating graduate students and workers are not the enemy but make the institution flourish.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Strezo:</strong> Expressed solidarity with the union, commending their courage and perseverance.</li>
<li><strong>President Davis:</strong> Echoed thanks to speakers. Supported the resolution, noting the fundamental issue for millions of workers. Shared his mother's experience as a teacher and union representative, highlighting the challenges without the right to strike. Emphasized the need for collaboration on shared values.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Outcome:</strong> Approved.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="84-item-103-resolution-by-councilor-burnley-public-workers-right-to-strike">8.4. Item 10.3: Resolution by Councilor Burnley (Public Workers' Right to Strike)</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> Resolution in support of certain public workers' right to strike.</li>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Councilor Burnley:</strong> Argued that the fundamental power of workers is to withhold labor, and public workers should have this right. Supported State House bills to grant this right. Acknowledged concerns about service disruption but emphasized that communities understand when workers fight against injustice from corporations or governments. Stated that denying the right to strike allows punishment for seeking better conditions.</li>
<li><strong>Speakers:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Colette Burrard (Resident, Ward 7; Public School Teacher):</strong> Described her Andover Education Association's strike in November 2023 due to the school committee's refusal to negotiate on issues like recess expansion and living wages for instructional assistants. Stated strikes are risky but necessary when employers refuse to bargain, as current laws incentivize employers to wait out unions. Argued that making strikes illegal doesn't stop them; giving workers the ability to strike when management refuses to negotiate is the solution.</li>
<li><strong>Jim Kaplan (Resident, Ward 6; Mass Teachers Association):</strong> Stated the division between private and public sector labor rights is historical, rooted in exclusions of agricultural and Black workers from labor protections. Argued that granting public sector workers the right to strike would invigorate the Democratic Party by engaging the working class. Cited the Somerville Municipal Employees Association's long struggle, which would have been shorter with the right to strike.</li>
<li><strong>Mary Ann Wallace (Resident, Ward 4; Regional Vice President, SEIU 509):</strong> Stated public sector workers are held "at gunpoint" without the right to strike, unable to fight for members, families, and clients. Highlighted that not all contracts are just about wages but also working conditions and community needs. Described how state employers control bargaining, leading to stalled negotiations and withheld payments. Argued that public sector workers, often at a disadvantage, deserve the dignity of the right to strike.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Co-sponsors:</strong> Councillors Wilson, Davis, Scott, Mbah, McLaughlin, Strezo.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor McLaughlin:</strong> Supported the resolution. Discussed the historical struggle for labor rights, noting that strikes are not vacations but involve significant risk for workers. Emphasized that if workers vote to strike, it's a serious decision. Connected the decline in union membership to the decline of the Democratic Party.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Wilson:</strong> Referenced the UK Labor Party's approach to avoiding public sector strikes by offering good contracts, suggesting this is the solution rather than prohibiting strikes.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Scott:</strong> Highlighted that public sector workers often take lower pay due to their commitment to public service values. Argued that denying the right to strike removes their decision-making power in shaping policy and service delivery. Stated that removing impediments to worker involvement leads to a better system.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Mbah:</strong> Thanked Councilor Burnley and speakers. Expressed embarrassment that such a conversation is still necessary.</li>
<li><strong>President Davis:</strong> Reiterated support for the resolution and speakers. Noted that the Council is expressing support for state-level legislation. Emphasized the fundamental nature of the issue and the need for public sector workers to advocate for themselves. Highlighted the importance of collaboration across political divides.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Outcome:</strong> Approved.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="85-item-104-communication-by-councilor-burnley-wage-theft-advisory-committee">8.5. Item 10.4: Communication by Councilor Burnley (Wage Theft Advisory Committee)</h4>

<li><strong>Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Councilor Burnley:</strong> Reminded colleagues of amendments to the Wage Theft Ordinance, specifically that committee positions are approved by the Council President and City Council. Stated that the committee currently lacks a quorum. Announced plans to reach out to unions to find representatives to fill seats and ensure the committee can effectively address wage theft in Somerville.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Chair:</strong> Councilor Davis.</li>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Mopeds/Motorized Bicycles:</strong> Discussed regulation of mopeds/motorized bicycles, focusing on insurance and community path safety. Item left in committee to explore further regulations with the law department.</li>
<li><strong>Proposed Amendments to Condominium Conversion Ordinance (Item 24-1740 / 25-1044):</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Motion:</strong> Councilor Davis moved to sever Item 25-1044 with the intent of placing it on file.</li>
<li><strong>Outcome:</strong> Item 25-1044 severed and placed on file.</li>
<li><strong>Explanation:</strong> Councilor Davis explained that Item 7.1 (a request from the Mayor) is a replacement for the committee item, incorporating an October 1st effective date.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Outcome:</strong> Report accepted as submitted.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="102-item-71-request-of-the-mayor-condominium-conversion-ordinance-amendment">10.2. Item 7.1: Request of the Mayor (Condominium Conversion Ordinance Amendment)</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> Requesting ordainment of an amendment to sections 7-64, 7-65, and 7-68 of the Code of Ordinances to reduce displacement of tenants and update relocation payments.</li>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Councilor Davis:</strong> Stated this item is a replacement for the one placed on file, substantively identical except for the October 1st effective date. Explained the changes resulted from a working group addressing loopholes in the ordinance that allowed tenants to be displaced before condo conversion. The intent is to make it more attractive to keep folks in their homes. Noted that the administration requested no action be taken tonight, and feedback has been received.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Scott:</strong> Thanked the working group. Explained the fundamental problem: tenants' rights were being circumvented due to the ordinance's timeline, allowing displacement before compensation. Stated the proposed changes are an "elegant solution" that reinforces the intent of the ordinance and inconveniences those attempting to avoid tenant relocation benefits. Thanked the clerk's office for resolving the effective date issue.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Davis:</strong> Added that the intended effect is to make it more attractive to keep folks in their homes. Acknowledged constituent concerns and feedback received since the committee meeting. Stated that the administration's position is that the October 1st effective date would not change regardless of when the Council acts.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Wilson:</strong> Suggested tabling the item until the next meeting to allow all councillors to be present and for further public input, given the October 1st effective date provides time.</li>
<li><strong>Motion:</strong> Councilor Wilson moved to table Item 7.1, along with related public communications (Items 9.8, 10.18, 10.19, 10.20), until the next meeting.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Davis:</strong> Supported the motion to table, stating it allows time to consider feedback and potential unintended consequences without affecting the October 1st effective date.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Outcome:</strong> Motion to table approved. Items 7.1, 9.8, 10.18, 10.19, and 10.20 laid on the table until the next meeting.</li>
