We have a few items that we&#39;re gonna take out of order, but not in the sort of normal sense that we do. We&#39;re actually gonna take the regular order of business first, although we will take up with item 4.1, we will take up item 10.7 along with that out of order. Then we will take up items 10.1 and 10.4, and then back to the regular order of business. Yeah, that&#39;s essentially the plan. At some point after we take up items, in that then regular order after 7.5, we&#39;re going to take items 10.5 and 10.6 out of business as well. The reason for that, there are a number of items that require two-thirds vote, and we will have a couple of our members who are away this evening joining us remotely so that we will have the ability to, if everyone were to vote in favor of those items, at least we have the possibility of having a two-thirds vote. Of course, if not, then no worries, then that, then we go on. We&#39;ll then have a brief recess and we&#39;ll come back and we will finish the items in the regular order. So not quite as clean cut as usual, but we&#39;re trying to balance the reality of folks this time of year and make sure that we get the city&#39;s business done. So would the clerk please call the next item.</td>

The problem, though, is that we are very concerned as to how approximate this can be. I, as an electrician myself, you know, this is... It&#39;s electricity, it&#39;s an unforeseen kind of situation, something you can&#39;t see and it can hurt you. And my experience running 2,000 amp services for a brand new Dunkin&#39; Donuts and for a 14 unit apartment, we wanna know exact, we don&#39;t want approximate because if this impedes or imposes on our, you know, our private property we would like to know because if it does this would require an easement from the uh from the landlord and you know from us personally so we want exact not not approximate just to make sure okay thank you all right is there anyone else here to speak on the item</td>

Two things I want to say about this issue. Everyone following the news understands that the local teamsters are on strike against Republic Services. in 14 cities in Massachusetts. And this is not a union against some small town trash company. This is the second largest waste disposal unit in the country. Bill Gates is the largest shareholder of this company. and the CEO makes 170 times more than the average trash collector. So this is really the corporatization and consolidation of wealth at the expense of workers, which is typical, but it&#39;s in our backyard, so it&#39;s something we have to speak up about. So I&#39;ll let the teams just speak for themselves, too. There&#39;s Bridget Quinn from Local 25. I&#39;d like to sponsor her to speak and just encourage everyone. I think most people already signed on to support this item.</td>

                <td> So good evening. For the record, my name is Bridget Quinn, and I&#39;m the legislative director for Teamsters Joint Council 10 New England. I just want to start by thanking Councilor McLaughlin and Clingan for sponsoring our resolution, of course, for the great support that we have with all the councilors signing on. So Local 25 represents 450 workers at Republic Services. And our members have tough, demanding jobs, and they provide such an important service to our communities. For the past several months, Teamsters Local 25 has been bargaining with Republic Services for a new contract. We have a few demands, very simple demands. Higher wages, affordable and accessible health insurance, and safe working conditions. Republic Services has repeatedly refused to bargain in good faith. And as a result, this company has caused a strike that is disrupting trash collection in 14 communities around eastern Massachusetts. And it&#39;s also left small businesses, like the ones here in Somerville, scrambling for alternatives for their trash collection. And so make no mistake, this strike is completely and totally the fault of Republic Services. And it&#39;s also not an isolated incident. Republic Teamsters in California, Illinois, and Georgia, and Washington State have also been forced to strike, and now we have 2,000 Teamsters on the strike line because, again, this company refuses to pay its workers competitive wages and respect them in the workplace. Republic, as we know, would be nothing without its workforce, its workers who work hard every single day to provide service to our communities. But for far too long, this corporation has forced our members to endure unsafe working conditions and economic precariousity. Our members will stay on strike until they get the contract that they deserve, because none of our demands are unreasonable in any way, shape, or form. We&#39;re calling on Republic Services, which is the second largest waste company in the nation, to provide the same wages and benefits that local companies like Capital Waste provide to our Teamsters. If a local company can afford it, so can Republic Services. They can and should take care of our members and make sure that they go to work and save working conditions and come home at the end of the day and can provide for their families. And so I just want to close by thanking the members of the City Council here for supporting the workers. You always do, and we very much appreciate it any time. Thank you for your time.</td>

I also think it shows contempt for its customers and I think that&#39;s unacceptable and just shame on public services and I encourage if you have public services in your business or in residential to reach out to them and let them know that this is unacceptable and to stand with the Teamsters and stand for fair wages and to respect the employees. So that&#39;s all I have to say with that. We&#39;re with you. Thank you.</td>

I just want to make a highlight because when, for members of the public, when they say the demands are not unreasonable, like just a caption from the resolution, It says, these workers have been bargaining in good faith for fair wages, affordable health care, safe working conditions, and adequate paid time off, standards that reflect both the dignity of their labor and the financial success of their employer. And Republic Services has failed to meet these reasonable demands and has refused to return to the negotiating table, prompting TeamSTAR&#39;s Local 25 to initiate a 24-on-7 strike until a fair agreement is reached. I&#39;m telling you, Republic Services is at gritty peaks. I don&#39;t think that most of these issues that people are negotiating, just like she said, I just want to share that for members to know that these are just basic stuff that workers need to present their dignity that they are not giving to them. So thank you for indulging me. Thank you. Councillor Scott.</td>

One thing that I did want to highlight, though, in this is the mention that there are apparently over 100 residential and commercial customers here in Somerville, particularly as it relates to the residential. I&#39;ve heard from several large buildings in my district who are concerned about the heat, about smell, and about the fact that It&#39;s really going to be a logjam situation for them. I would like to request that the administration consider the possibility of extending some of our municipal tipping. I know the city&#39;s policy has been not to service buildings over a certain size, but for the duration of this particular labor conflict as a way to both support our residents, and to support the workers who are fairly on strike here to get good working conditions. I&#39;d like the administration to consider what we can do to facilitate residential trash pickup for these buildings that are left high and dry by Republic Services right now.

But the point I was trying to make was, We are seeing some incredibly disturbing and frankly disgusting actions by the largest higher education institution, not only in our great Commonwealth, but in the nation. An institution which has billions, billions of dollars is attempting to remove 973 workers from their union. on the argument that they should have never been considered for the union anyway, which is an argument that the Harvard Grad Students Union has faced since they tried to unionize initially many years ago, this argument that they are not workers and they are not entitled to the benefits of workers. Now, this is something that I view as incredibly dangerous and existential for workers of all kinds and backgrounds because it&#39;s a fight that predates Harvard, predates this nation, and gets to the heart of the fight for labor. When we define what a worker is, in such a way that we remove people who do the hard work to make our institutions run, to clean our facilities, to make our society function. We are allowing the degradation of the dignity of every single person. on this planet, the degradation of all workers. This is an injury that strikes at the heart of not only unions, but of every person who gets up and goes out the door trying to provide for their families, trying to provide for themselves. When we define workers as less than and to say that they do not have the rights that all people are deserving of we not only besmirch but degradates our collective dignity and that is what harvard is attempting to do through reliance on a besieged national labor relations board through The force of knowing that if they are able to remove these workers from the union, they will essentially cut out a third of their dues. They will be effectively trying to bankrupt this union. And like so many other fights, we know that this will only be the beginning. If they are able to rip apart unions years after they have been certified, years after they have negotiated contracts, there is nothing stopping them from moving forward and doing this in such a way that they can attack all unions. And at a time where work itself is being destroyed by technology, AI, the mass layoffs of various industries, we as a community need to stand up for all the workers in our community and make sure that Somerville is a union town. And to that point, I would like to sponsor a Somerville resident and a member of the Harvard Grad Student Union, Dorothy Manovich, to speak up to this issue. Thank you.</td>

                <td>Thank you. Hello. Well, first of all, thank you so much, Councillor Burnley, for bringing this resolution and for having me here to talk a little bit about it and what this means. So my name is Dorothy Manovich. I have been a Somerville resident for five years, living in Ward 2 in Union Square. And I have, you know, throughout the course of my graduate program, I have been able to live a good life here because of my union and the things that my union has fought and won for me. Some of these things include being able to pay for dental surgery that I would not have been able to afford otherwise, which was reimbursed through union health care funds, protections from overwork, protections from harassment and discrimination that I&#39;ve benefited from in my workplace. And that&#39;s, you know, just kind of like the top of the list of some of the union protections that we won as the Harvard Graduate Students Union that have made my life and my work livable here in this amazing community. And so I also wanted to highlight, in addition to some of the points that Councillor Burnley has already highlighted, kind of what is happening right now for the Harvard Graduate Students Union and at Harvard and what this means for us, right? So as counselor Burnley said, Harvard University is attempting to strip union rights fully from 973 workers based on our most recent analysis and partially from an additional thousand workers. And this constitutes an attack on those workers specifically and on our union in general. These workers are also concentrated in STEM fields, which have already been attacked by the Trump administration. These are workers who are already under extreme stress and labs that are already seeing funding cuts. They&#39;re being attacked by the Trump administration and now they are being attacked by their own university. And not only is this just a massive problem, it&#39;s also illegal. This is pretty explicitly illegal, and this is something that with a functional NLRB, we would have many more options to fight this, but because Harvard thinks they can get away with it, and because labor law and the NLRB is what it is, we are in a position, we are in a more difficult position than we ought to be. And so I want to highlight specifically what this means for the workers who are attempting, or Harvard University is attempting to cut out of our unit. So these are 1,000 workers who are going to lose the wage protections that we have in our contract. Any new wage increases that we win, if Harvard is successful, they will not have access to those. They will not have access to the harassment and discrimination protections that are so important to us and that we are fighting expand in our next contract. And as I&#39;m sure a lot of you are aware, Harvard has had massive, massive scandals, especially related to gender-based and sexual harassment over the past decade, some of which were centered specifically in my department. And so, in addition to this, we also have funds to help people with emergencies when they lose their housing, when they have a family member who passes away or gets sick and they need to travel and have expenses that they weren&#39;t expecting. We can cover those. We have funds for health care and dental and child care, which, as we know, is a problem not only for the parents who are in our union, but also for our community, so many parents in our community. And if Harvard is successful in cutting out these workers, all of that is going to evaporate for them. We also as a union rely on union dues like all other unions do in order to fight for our workers. That means paying for lawyers, that means paying for our wonderful staff who carry a lot of the burden of our organizing and basically everything that comes with running a successful organization. And so with a potentially massive cut in dues, we will be at a much lower capacity to operate, which Harvard has never wanted to have any unions on campus, and they fought very hard against the formation of our union, and so it is not surprising that they are seeking to weaken it in this way. And so the solution here is for Harvard to once again recognize these workers as part of our unit, as they have been since our unit&#39;s inception, And once again, it falls on us as a union, on our union brothers and sisters, and on our community to fight shame and pressure Harvard into doing the right thing. And so we hope to get the council&#39;s support on this resolution and your partnership in this fight for the workers in our union and the workers in our community. Thank you. OK.</td>

As the spouse of someone who I watch get just terribly exploited for five years in a Ph.D. program by the academy, this is just disgusting. It&#39;s infuriating to see this. Academia is founded on the exploitation of student labor. Let&#39;s be real about that. And the best antidote is student unionization. I can&#39;t tell you how many times during those five years of grad school that I told my wife how badly they needed a union after witnessing the latest ridiculous treatment of her or her colleagues. So yeah, I stand in solidarity with HGSU and UAW against this ridiculous action by Harvard. Shame on you, Harvard.</td>

I am dismayed that we have to be having this conversation right now. I think it is, somebody very wisely told me not too long ago, that this is a time to de-escalate all conflict with anyone who is not actually the enemy. And we are in an environment where conflict is being escalated, where the force of the federal government is being deployed at both institutions and directly at our neighbors. We&#39;ve seen institutions that have buckled to that pressure, whether it would be a law firm like Paul Weiss or a university like Columbia, who decided that collaboration was the better approach. But here, When Harvard decided to not buckle, to stand up for some principles that most people would like to see them stand up for, there was an outpouring of support from the community, from institutions all over the country to say thank you for doing the brave thing, for doing the right thing. Here, the brave thing, the right thing is very obvious. And I would urge Harvard to de-escalate this conflict because your graduate students are not the enemy. Your workers are not the enemy. They are the people that make your institution flourish. They&#39;re the people that make your institution function. They&#39;re the people that make your institution great. And confusing your allies with your enemies is one of the simplest ways to undermine and rot out your entire organization. So, I would implore Harvard, please, let&#39;s de-escalate this conflict. Let&#39;s all stay on the same side of fighting for the values that we all share. Thank you, Mr. President. MR.</td>

                <td>Councillor Burnley. Thank you, Mr. President. You might sense a trend in my items this evening. On the previous item, I spoke a bit about the importance of recognizing the dignity of workers, understanding what being a worker entitles a person to within an organization. And to that point, on this item, the fundamental power that workers have is to withhold their labor. There is, in my opinion, no more fundamental right than that as a worker. And frankly, as a citizen, no more fundamental right than to withhold labor and our finances from destructive institutions or programs. And yet, so many public workers who make our institutions flourish, operate from cities and towns to state government to federal government, are not given the same rights as so many workers across this nation and across our Commonwealth and in our own community. This resolution is in support of a pair of bills at the State House that would give certain public workers the right to strike. Now, I understand that some folks worry about that, right? We just heard this evening, well, so no one picks up the trash. There&#39;s gonna be trash everywhere, you know? And yet, from Councillor Scott&#39;s comments to Councillor McLaughlin&#39;s comments, I have to believe that people will be understanding when they know that our communities are, collectively going through this struggle together, when mega corporations, when institutions such as ours, public bodies, governments, when they do the wrong thing, workers have the right to, and they should have the right to, withhold their labor in pursuit of better working conditions, higher wages, decency, dignity, in the workplace and in their lives. For far too long, folks like our teachers have not had the right to strike. Some have. Some brave folks have. But they&#39;ve been punished for it time and time again. We cannot live in a society where workers have their basic human rights respected if they cannot exercise the most fundamental power of laborers, which is the right to strike. And that&#39;s why I&#39;m calling on my colleagues to co-sponsor this, to support this pair of legislation at the state level, because Somerville&#39;s voice does matter. I know it&#39;s easy to push aside us and say we&#39;re just a small city that has a particularly progressive bent, but our leadership matters, and the voices that we bring to the table matter to push forward these issues. And I wanna bring forward some voices of our community right now, and I&#39;d like to sponsor. I&#39;m gonna do it all in one, if that&#39;s okay. Jim Kaplan, Marian Walls, and Colette Berhard.</td>

                <td>Hi, I&#39;m Colette Burrard from Ward 7. And for the past 17 years, I&#39;ve been a resident of Somerville. And I&#39;ve also been a public school teacher in Massachusetts. So back in November of 2023, my local Andover Education Association went on strike. And it was terrifying. It was really risky. And if you know anything about the demographics of Andover and about our district in general, we have traditionally not been a very assertive kind of union until recent years but we we had to do this because for the better part of a year our school committee was refusing to negotiate with us and this was on virtually every issue that came before them in bargaining from expanding recess for our elementary students which wouldn&#39;t have cost the district anything to implement to providing living living wages for instructional assistance who topped out in $30-something thousand dollars a year. Some of them were in our district for two decades, couldn&#39;t afford to have health insurance deducted from their paychecks. Their attractability was not surprising because earlier during the pandemic years, they were refusing to negotiate with us about getting independent contractors to come in and evaluate our HVAC systems so that we could come to school safely during a worldwide pandemic. So I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve noticed that Andover is not on an island here. We were preceded by Malden, by Haverhill. We were followed by Gloucester, Marblehead, Newton, Beverly. And We&#39;ve done this wave of strikes despite the risk, despite the fact that we&#39;ve faced potentially crippling fines, because right now our employers have really no incentive to negotiate with us at all. They know that the law is on their side, they hold that over us, and as such they feel they have the moral authority to wait us out. They know or suspect that we won&#39;t be able to financially withstand a strike action. And so these are going to continue indefinitely because this is not a sustainable situation. Making strikes illegal for public sector workers isn&#39;t stopping strikes. If you want to prevent strikes, then you need to support giving us the ability to withhold our labor when our management refuses to negotiate with us. So I really urge you to support this resolution and to support all of your workers who deserve the same rights as our private sector labor brethren.</td>

                <td>Thanks. Following that up, a second speaker from the Mass Teachers Association, also an alumni of this union here in Somerville for 30-something years, 34 years teaching in Somerville. My name is Jim Kaplan. I&#39;m a resident in Ward 6, Lance&#39;s home ward. I have three minutes and three points. Number one, the division between private sector rights and public sector denial of rights is part of the original crafting of labor law in the United States. There were carve outs on various things designed to assure enough votes to get it through. Those carve outs established, for example, the exclusion agricultural labor from the NORB. Why? Because they were brown skinned and they spoke Spanish and many did not have citizenship at the time. It arranged for the carve out of black workers, especially in the south where southern representatives and senators would not vote for the bill. to establish the NORB and labor rights, the Wagner Act, unless black workers were excluded from labor protections. And it divided into private sector and public sector. And public sector had no right to strike in most states, state regulated. Therefore, it can be changed in this state. In some ways, we&#39;re actually quite lucky under the impending dictatorship of the new Fuhrer. we actually may be in a better position than some of the private unions that are going to be targets for union busting. Nonetheless, it would be a much better situation if we were increasing in power. And I speak tonight to the last point, which is all the folks around this horseshoe are Democrats. with an interest in the invigoration of the Democratic Party in order to stop this drive toward dictatorship that we are in right now. The way to do that is to engage the working class in this country through all its expressions, one of which is the labor movement. And that means taking some risks that some thinks may jeopardize the apple cart in some areas. Here in Somerville, It won&#39;t necessarily do that in the case of the teachers, the education workers, the educators union bargaining. I was astounded at how cordial the last night&#39;s bargaining was when they attained a contract. On the other hand, there was the long, drawn out, slow torture of what was then the Somerville Municipal Employees Association. Had they had the right to strike, that contract would have been settled much earlier and we would not have lost nearly as many people out of that union working for the citizens of the city. There may be some conflicts that cause strain. If you want a labor movement to fill the sails of the Democratic Party that all the people here belong to in one wing or the other, then you&#39;re going to have to take some risks. Otherwise, without a labor movement, you saw in the last election where alienated victims of a bad economy and utter inaction from either of the two parties often on labor issues cost us. That&#39;s very clear. It&#39;s a small risk, and there&#39;s a big gain if you build a labor movement. Thank you.</td>

I&#39;m a resident of Ward 4 and a regional vice president for SEIU 509 and sit on the public sector side of the local, which represents 13 state agencies. One of the issues on why we support this, the right to strike, is because we are held gunpoint, for lack of a better word, because we have no ability to really fight for what our members and the families and clients that we represent deserve. Not all contracts are just about wages. It&#39;s about working conditions, but it&#39;s also about fighting for the people that reside in our communities. And we are literally held at the state, for my local, we are literally held at the state&#39;s beck and call as to when they wanna sit at the bargaining table. At any point, they can cancel a session, they&#39;re not, They don&#39;t have to come with bargaining items. We have literally stalled negotiations for over a year at times because they control when we meet, because we have no power over them. If all of you can remember, a couple of years ago, we actually passed a contract and our money was being withheld from the state. They wouldn&#39;t sign the increases. It was Christmas time, and our members were going without their money that they bargained for, voted for, but it was sitting. We are held by municipalities, by state electeds, all the time. And we&#39;re also held and bound. Our raises come based on income. So we&#39;re already at a disadvantage most times than large corporations like Harvard, The least we can do is give us, our workers and our members, the dignity to have the right to strike for what we deserve and what our families deserve and our communities deserve.

There were times when the National Guard would break up strikes in support of business owners. Business owners were allowed to lock out employees, but unions were not allowed to strike. People were killed over this. And the struggle for labor continues to this day. And I I support first of all I support this But you know people think you know going on a strike is no small thing. It&#39;s not a vacation. It&#39;s not time off The workers take a tremendous risk doing this a risk of not getting paid a risk of potentially losing their jobs Being replaced by scabs or whatever you want to call it There&#39;s a chance that things do not work out for the workers so if a group of people decide to vote and favor of a strike that&#39;s a really big deal and I don&#39;t want to see teachers go on strike I don&#39;t want to see garbage workers go on strike because everybody gets hurt in that process but they&#39;re hurt along with it as well and they&#39;re the people who are dealing with it the most direct and just to point out to you what Jim said as well you know the history of this is the Democratic Party was used to be organized labor was the backbone of the Democratic Party and Union membership has declined. The Democratic Party has declined. And then there&#39;s also instances where, you know, maybe the values aren&#39;t aligned like they used to be. So I do see this as a good opportunity to speak up in support of organized labor, people&#39;s right to strike, which again is, it&#39;s a risk they are taking. It&#39;s not a fun decision. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a decision anybody who relies on a salary would take lightly. So even a public service employee, I would hope, you know, vital work being done, but people need to be paid for that vital work as well.</td>

                <td>Yeah, thanks, Mr. President. Yeah, thank you. Thank you, my colleague, for bringing this forward. I appreciate the comment about, you know, how do you ultimately, like the power of the strike and how you ultimately settle these. It was just yesterday, there was a headline I read from the UK. It was something to the effect of labor, the Labor Party promised to do away with public sector strikes. Why are we seeing so many of them? And I was shocked for a second. I know obviously this new labor is a little disappointing to everyone, but I thought, have they really abandoned public sector strikes? And it turns out, Labor&#39;s approach has been to go give good contracts to their public sector unions over there, and that&#39;s how they&#39;re avoiding public sector strikes. So it just speaks to what we heard about how the answer to, you know, yes, give the right to public sector employees to strike, and then go do right by them, and you won&#39;t have public sector strikes. Simple.</td>

                <td> Councilor Scott. Thank you, Mr. President. We talked about a lot of important pieces of organized labor in unions tonight. I want to lift up one thing that Ms. Wallace touched upon, which is that the folks that are working in these public sector jobs are frequently taking lower pay. because they believe in an ideal of a public sector that provides services, a government that works for the people, that helps our neighbors. And as politicians who sit around having large conversations about values and then try to implement policy, I don&#39;t think it should be undervalued how much the people working in direct service delivery in these public sector jobs also have really strong values around the services that they are providing and the services they would like to provide. you know when we&#39;re talking about DCF you&#39;re talking about people who have the best interests of these families and these children at heart and want to be able to deliver the services that their neighbors deserve that they would like to be to receive if they were ever in a horrible horrible position like that and not having the dignity even the option of the right to strike puts them farther much farther away from the decision-making power that they should have when it comes to shaping policy not just the overarching things that we might talk about around this horseshoe or might get talked about at the Statehouse but even in the day-to-day implementation of how people are treated not just the workers on the job but the people that they&#39;re serving so as with just about all things um removing the impediments to more people being involved in those decision-making processes removing the risk that a worker faces because even with the right to strike a strike is a scary thing i believe that these are absolutely essential and i think they result in a better system where all the people who are part of this incredible rare idea of a government that serves our neighbors um should have the strongest possible voice in in how those services get delivered so i of course 100 support this and we&#39;ll continue to support the workers in our public sector who are trying to lift us all up together so thank you mr president okay thank you counselor bye</td>

I fully sign on to all of them, and thank you to the speakers who came here tonight to support this issue. To be clear, this is the Council reaching out to our representatives at the state level, expressing our support for something that is already before them. Whether this will move forward at the state level is very much an open question, at best. But I think it&#39;s, to me, I just want to note, and whatever small ounce of hope I have that this piece of the message gets through to anyone up there making a decision, this isn&#39;t wacky left Somerville doing its thing again, right? I love it when we do our thing, right? But this is a fundamental issue for millions of workers across the Commonwealth and the country. And we heard about the dignity of good working conditions, the ability to advocate on behalf of your fellow workers. I&#39;ve never quite understood why this particular rule exists, that public sector workers can&#39;t strike. And I&#39;ll confess, I&#39;m biased. My mom was a second grade teacher, special ed and second grade teacher for her whole life, her working life, and beyond her retirement, actually, and a proud union representative for her school. And I saw how hard she had to fight for anything, even just to get a planning period for her colleagues, which she did. She&#39;s very proud of that fact. But without the ability to strike, that was a huge win, just to get a little planning period during the day. So I support this. I hope that the folks at Beacon Hill will really take this seriously, give these organizations the right to advocate on behalf of themselves. And let me just echo the point that we on the left need to do a better job of being inclusive there are values there are things upon which that we all agree upon and if we aren&#39;t able to work with each other and find those common threads despite however vast the other differences might be we&#39;re going to continue to have a hard time winning on these issues so it&#39;s just It&#39;s incredibly important that we focus on where we can collaborate with folks, even when those folks disagree with us on other stuff. That&#39;s how we&#39;re going to win stuff like this. Thank you for bringing this. Thank you, Mr. President.</td>

And I think this item speaks exactly to the point you were just making and the point that Mr. Kaplan made as well. As my colleagues may remember, we made some amendments to the Wage Theft Ordinance, specifically to the Constitution of the Wage Theft Advisory Committee. touch that up a bit to remind folks that one of the changes that we made to that committee was that all those positions are to be approved and submitted by the council president and approved by the city council. I&#39;ve talked with some folks who currently reside on the committee, which effectively does not have quorum yet. And we are going to reach out to various unions to help find representatives who can help us do the important work to ensure that wage theft is not happening in Somerville and to support the workers who are on the front lines of those fights. So I just wanted to let you all know that when we come back from our, I&#39;ll say, I was gonna say well-deserved break, we&#39;ll see. When we come back from break, I will have a number of suggestions in collaboration with our council president about who can actually fill these seats on the Wageshift Advisory Committee so that we can do the work to actually report on issues of wage theft, have our first meeting effectively all year because we&#39;ve never been able to have true quorum, and move forward in a way that actually does right by these values that we&#39;ve been speaking toward all night. So just wanted you to have a heads up. There will be several suggestions when we come back from the break.</td>

                <td>Councillor Mbah. Thank you, Mr. President. So at the June 10th meeting of the Somerville Job Creation and Retention Trust, we reviewed key financial updates, active initiatives, and status of current RFPs. The trustee linkage fee fund remains at approximately $2.2 million, with an additional $900,000 expected from upcoming development. The trustees approved $294,200 dollars allocation to the city&#39;s summer promise department for child care advancement programs initiative. Following a discussion on the single proposal received at this collaborative structure, updates were also provided on the Good Municipal Jobs RFP, currently open through October 15. We limited union participation noted during its initial info session. and trustees encourage broader outreach to generate more proposals and share updates about potential training collaborations, including HVAC training through Bunking Hill Community College and facilities in Boynton Yards. The board also discussed planning for the next RFPs informed by partner feedback showing widespread concerns about federal funding cuts and a desire for flexible funding. Trustees explore revising eligible funding categories to better respond to current needs and emphasize the value of more open-ended RFP model. A new subcommittee was formed to draft the RFP and determine scope, timeline, and award structure. So we also have conversation to touch on workforce development pathways such as union partnership and some of the high school programs. which prepares students for certification and employment so we close the meeting with the reminder of future meetings and motion to adjoin pass unanimously i ask that it should be accepted as submitted all right thank you council by any discussion all right seeing none that item is placed on file item 4.4 is the communication by councillor Mbah conveying a report of the affordable housing trust fund counselor Thank you again, Mr. President. At this June 12th meeting, the Somerville Affordable Housing Trust reviewed its financial update and approved several funding requests aligned with its mission to preserve and expand affordable housing. As of May 31st, the Trust had approximately $8.2 million in its non-CPA account and $2.3 million in CPA funds available for new commitments. trustees unanimously approved a 129,805 CPA-funded emergency request from the Somerville Homeless Coalition to support four households at risk of displacement from permanent supportive housing. They also extended Somerville Housing Homeless Coalition&#39;s Tenant Stabilization Program contract through November 2026, and approved rolling over $17,000 in HomePass admin funds to a new contract. In addition, the trustees approved a new two-year contract for just a start to its TPS, allowing use of up to 10% of administrative costs, affirming eligibility for tenants for up to 100% AMI. The trustees also released 171,000 CPA commitment previously designated for the purchase of 31 to 35 Richardson Street as the property is no longer owned by the original applicant. some of the community corporation that is the occupant. So trustee discuss updates to open board positions including the needs to fill seats for non-profit representative and a banking finance professional with applications open through July 2025. staff noted that a new housing program coordinator has been hired to serve as a permanent liaison to the trust. A meeting concluded with recognition and appreciation for outgoing board member Brielle Carderan for her new contribution. And if you endorse me, Mr. President, the trust also met today, July 10. And actually, it was brief, 37 minutes. So the trust met earlier this evening for a short time to announce its end of the fiscal year financial status and to begin planning for the RFP that will be issued in the fall for rent subsidy and similar tenant assistance program. Beginning fiscal year 26, the trust is in fairly solid shape with a total of over 13.5 million available for new commitments. The revenue into the trust has been declining because of the poor real estate market and lack of new zoning linkage. However, the trust has achieved its 13 million of available funds partly by going back and moving unspent money from past years out of several accounts of unfinished programs. So the September RFP that will be written in the next few weeks will give the housing NGOs the opportunity to request funding for their various programs which help low-income tenants to make up rent areas and cover other deficiencies and legal costs to avoid eviction and find new housing when facing displacement. I ask that this report be accepted as submitted.</td>

Members will notice in their mailbox a printed copy of the Council&#39;s rules. I missed this. We used to have updated copies that I always kept in my drawer. I found it useful, and so I ask that we go back to this, to having this handy. Of course, this is not a complete set of the rules because we defer to Robert&#39;s Rules of Order. except for where they are superseded by this. So keep that handy if you want. It can come in really handy if you wanna use procedural rules to accomplish something. They can be very useful at times. What was the other thing I was gonna note? captioner is joining excellent that is very good news oh I submitted some changes to the committee assignments to the clerk today to replace me as chair because the president does not serve as chair or vice chair so in each case for those two committees the vice chair will assume the chair of those committees when those go out if anyone has any concerns for any reason of course let me know we can always adjust those will be For the remainder of this term, of course, in January, whomever is president will make their own determinations at that point for the new council. What else? Do not have a representative. Those with the new committee assignments will be sent to the council tomorrow morning? Oh, can we make them a late item since I didn&#39;t know I could do that until? She&#39;ll send them by the email tomorrow. Let&#39;s just fill in a few holes for, oh, and the other thing is, it&#39;s my intent as president, I should have said this earlier, so those won&#39;t be for the full year, it&#39;s my intent as president, when my understanding is for Ward 7, once the election happens, that person will begin to serve immediately, so it&#39;ll be my intent to fill that new counselor in for the last few weeks of the session, just to get a head start, I think so. Very well. And we have an attorney here, excellent. Who do we have? Attorney Selkirk, please introduce yourself and the request is to confirm that this item is appropriate for executive session.</td>

One was a proposal to look into regulation of mopeds or motorized bicycles. The Boston ordinance that was referenced really has to do with insurance on those, and so the discussion was, we kind of focused more on that as well as other ways that we might make the community path safer vis-a-vis motorized vehicles and the types thereof. The item was left in committee, I believe, to look into other ways we might suggest regulations. So over the course of the recess, we work with the law department to look for something we can do there. And then the primary discussion was on proposed amendments to the condominium conversion ordinance. I would like to, so that&#39;s item 24-1740. I would like to move to sever that item with the intent of placing it on file. The reason being that we have a separate item, which Madam Clerk, I left my notes up there, Madam Clerk?</td>

Because there was some disagreement on exactly how to do that logistically, we left that to be determined. The administration has worked with the clerk&#39;s office on proposed language, and that is reflected in item 7.1. So after the report, I will ask that we take up item 7.1, which is the replacement for this item. So first, Madam Clerk, I&#39;d like to request to, or Madam President, I move to sever item 25-1044 with the intent that it be placed on file.</td>

Substantively, it is exactly the same as the item that was in committee with the exception of the aforementioned October 1st effective date. The substantive changes are the result of a working group that met many times over the past several weeks or months. I&#39;m looking to Councillor Scott to correct me if I&#39;m wrong here. But the working group ultimately recommended some Minor changes in terms of textual, you know, in terms of the language. The intent, this was a result of requests and concerns that were brought to many Councillors from constituents who had experienced a building being sold and then being converted to condominiums effectively. finding a loophole in the ordinance. And the request was to the administration, Department of Housing Stability, the Housing Department, and others to see if there&#39;s a way we could mitigate the impacts of that scenario. And ultimately, what they came up with, working with the law department to make sure that what was recommended was on solid legal ground, what were the changes that are before you. So the substantivity is the same changes that have been before the council for many weeks now. discussed in committee a week and a half ago and reflected in the item that was in committee and are also reflected in item 7.1 before us. Mr. President, I&#39;d be happy to defer to the good counsel from Ward 2 who served on the working group. If there&#39;s more detail he cares to share about the substance of the amendment.</td>

                <td>Thank you, Mr. President, and thank you to my colleague from Chair of Legislative Matters, former Chair of Legislative Matters. this was in actually an incredible working group of staff working with members of the kind of conversion board based on as reports from constituents and the the fundamental problem is that there are tenants rights that should be provided and that based on the timeline of the ordinance as it currently exists has proven to be trivially trivially easy for tenants to be displaced from their apartments a demo permit to be pursued and then by the time the condo conversion process actually takes place those tenants are long gone and unable to be found and that the waiting process the timeline is such that it lines up pretty closely with the normal permitting process that somebody would go through. So the working group went into a great deal of depth on a variety of different approaches and I gotta say, some of them I liked a lot, but based on defensibility, based on efficacy, and frankly also on simplicity, this is a very elegant solution to quite a few of the problems, but in specific, the circumvention of the intent of the ordinance. So this is a very simple change. And for developers who want to do the right thing, it has zero impact whatsoever. All this required is that the people who are in the building Get the compensation that we have as a city and with the state&#39;s approval, I have said they are due to help them relocate and find a place to live. I was just trying to go upstairs. Like what&#39;s the six one thousand the other? You go down like nobody&#39;s process. It&#39;s talking about goal in the least. This just goes through as intended, which is, I think, the way we would all hope things would work. Right. Follow the rules. Everybody wins it. will and intentionally so inconvenience people who are attempting to not provide their tenant relocation benefits or their tenant right benefits that the council has established as a policy goal and established an ordinance through several years of work so i want to once again reiterate the things that i gave in legislative matters committee for the people who worked on this for the folks who brought a spirit of collaboration and exploration to the table and trying to reinforce this ordinance I feel like this is really straightforward and I look forward to voting on it as soon as possible. And also I want to thank the clerk&#39;s office for collaborating on the language to get that thorny effective date issue resolved. So thank you again.</td>

                <td> Mr. President, if I may add just a little bit of additional detail. Thank you, through you to the good Councillor from Ward 2, thank you for that summary. One point that I thought I found interesting in the discussion as it was conveyed to the committee was that the ultimate effect or the intended effect of the proposed changes, which as I said are very minor in terms of the actual language, are to make it more attractive to keep folks in their homes, to not clear out a building. And that is truly the driving, as I understand it, that was the driving intent, really not anything else other than to to make it make more sense for folks who might own the properties or be buying properties to keep folks in their homes until they&#39;re ready to take other actions on it. I will note that during the meeting, the administration noted that there had been a request from some constituents to not take action this evening. or that evening, the evening of the committee meeting, and to that end, we did ultimately recommend approval, but I noted very specifically that if folks did have concerns, at that point I had not heard any of those concerns directly, but certainly that provided us a week and a half opportunity for folks to weigh in. I have received some feedback since that time, as I imagine others have as well, And we have four items that are also on the agenda this evening that are communications regarding that. So I just wanted to call folks&#39; attention to that. Thank you, Mr. President.</td>

Given that we have seven of us here in the chamber tonight, with two joining us here remotely, I think it makes a lot of sense that Councillor Davis referred to the feedback about, you know, just taking a beat just to table it for our next meeting in order to give counselors just time to know exactly what this is and know it frontwards and backwards for good two-way communication with the public about it and to have all 10 of us here for that discussion and that vote. i spent time earlier today watching that presentation from legislative matters last week reading the legislation talking to our legislative policy analyst i&#39;m personally a good place myself as a result i support this i think it accomplishes the stated goals with some really simple clever incentivization uh i&#39;m not gonna pretend that that i think that you know all of us are are in that same place i&#39;ve had that same opportunity to get to that comfort level so i think this is about the process and i think it makes sense to uh to just table it for the next meeting uh and take up and so i&#39;ll move to table the item um it&#39;s uh item 7-1 until our next meeting</td>

Certainly want to make sure folks have time to weigh in. they have now but certainly some of the I read all the communications that came in I would actually ask that those four items be be also laid in the table so that they remain in the agenda so we have that context the folks want to you know review them over the summer there was some there were some concerns raised that that were not specifically discussed in the committee meeting and I I will take the opportunity over the recess to touch base with economic development, other folks to just get their feedback on some of those concerns. Find out if there may be unintended consequences that we haven&#39;t considered. I won&#39;t opine on whether I think there are or not. But I did have a conversation with staff from Intergovernmental Affairs today, and it&#39;s the administration&#39;s position, and it certainly would be my position as well, that regardless of taking action on this this evening, if this motion to table fails, or whether we take it up at the next meeting of the council, which would be the end of August, that that October 1st date would not change. So, effectively, the effect of these changes would not happen any later. We essentially have a bit of time to make sure that everyone has a chance to weigh in, that we all have a chance to consider those views without, if we then do decide to go forward, it changing the effective date in any way. So, thank you, Mr. President.</td>

In addition to the minutes from our six budget season meetings from last month, we were recommended by a 4-0 vote that you approved tonight. Authorization to dispose of unclaimed bicycles through a program in conjunction with the YMCA whereby Somerville residents can apply to get free, tuned-up bikes. A long-delayed response to an order by Councilors Ewen Campin and Clingan back in 2021. A new contract with Blue Bikes. I&#39;ve made some requests for some new stations in areas of our city that look to be currently underserved by Blue Bikes. an extension of the lease agreement for the parking lot off Grove Street between Elm and Highland Ave, and a time-only extension with the Franklin Cummings Institute for Job Training for the Job Creation Retention Trust. We also marked as withdrawn three items that the administration requested to be withdrawn. The last two of those, IDs number 25-1163 and 25-1164, are being replaced with two new items submitted for tonight&#39;s meeting. Those are agenda items 7-2 and 10-5. The former is due to changes prior to Tuesday night&#39;s meeting, while the latter is due to the hours of the civic space area being amended from an original 8 a.m. to sunset, as stated in that original item that&#39;s being request be withdrawn, instead simply referring to the city&#39;s standard hours for our parks by ordinance, which is currently 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. With that, I ask this committee report be accepted as submitted.

We discussed the Councilor McLaughlin&#39;s order talking about the housing bond bill and how Somerville may strengthen its protections and the condominium conversion and tenant protection laws. And I&#39;m going to skip ahead to convey to you some really important, so read that in the minutes, but I want to skip ahead to convey to you some information about the Sealing of evictions and the recent state legislation, which is now in effect. Technically May 5th of this year, now tenants can petition the court to seal records from no-fault evictions, such as when a landlord sells a property, significantly increases rent, or dismisses the case. So please convey that to your constituents. This is in effect, and the Office of Housing Stability is working very hard to make sure to get the information out to tenants, to everybody. We&#39;re working alongside Cambridge with that, so look for workshops. There have already been six so far, but the information is trying to get out there as fast as possible. We also discussed the economic impact of small businesses as a result of recent federal immigration policies. We had Deputy Director Dana Whiteside to discuss some Older efforts such as the business impact of packets, it&#39;s 1033, so bear with me here. that they created, and also some grants that are still happening, oh, the leasing handbook, that was presented last year, but he reminded us that it exists, and really encourage you to pass that along to your constituents as well. We also talked about how the efforts being put forward of how we can get, how small businesses can obtain tax IDs so that, you know, when we have our twice a year events slice of the city, that maybe they can be contracted with the city to be one of the vendors. That&#39;s important. The deputy director has said that these programs exist and they are willing to help make that possible. So tell your constituents to reach out to economic development so that they can be part of that. We also talked about the we talked about our one-year action plan for community development block grant we had our Director of Finance and Community Development Ellen ANC sicko it&#39;s 1030 so talking about just the updates that have happened since the last year and I want to emphasize this that For the first time in 20 years, the city will be fully leveraging the financing capabilities of the Community Development Block Grant. And this will require the city to make its annual entitlement payment of $500,000. And that will result in significantly long-term benefits for the community. So that&#39;s happening now. It&#39;s inactivated. That&#39;s exciting. And then we also talked about more impact on small businesses and how construction plays a role in that. Kept it in committee, so I&#39;d love to hear more Conversations and what you&#39;re experiencing colleagues and always welcome to discuss that in committee as well But I think that conversation has to be happening ongoing especially with what with the impacts we&#39;re having federally and with all the construction and digging up of streets, et cetera, that we&#39;re all hearing about. So I ask that these minutes be submitted as, or accepted as submitted.</td>

The president moves that this council congratulates Councilor Sait on the birth of her child, who arrived this week, July 3rd, I believe. My understanding is everyone&#39;s doing well. I&#39;m very happy, and we look forward to having one more set of hands to help us all get our job done at the council. So congratulations to Councillor Sait. That item is approved.</td>
