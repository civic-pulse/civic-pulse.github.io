Pursuant to Chapter 2 of the Acts of 2025, this meeting of the City Council is being conducted via remote participation. We will post an audio recording, audio-video recording, transcript, or other comprehensive record of these proceedings as soon as possible after the meeting on the City Assembly website and local cable access government channels. Let it be known that pursuant to our rules, this council salutes the flag and reaffirms our oath. In the event of emergency, we must evacuate the building. Please locate nearest emergency exit, including the one behind me. All means of egress must be kept clear throughout the meeting, from objects and persons, et cetera. Looks like a short crowd tonight, so I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll have to worry about that. Would the clerk please call the roll to establish</td>

                <td>Thank you, Mr. President, through you. I just, I want to say before I read this little recap that we&#39;ve had a really trying summer with fires, and I know there are plans to recognize other folks, but this was brought forth by myself and Councilor Wilson, who were on the scene of the Wheatland Street fire, and so this comes out of that, but many people have suffered over the summer with these fires. This is just one story of a situation that I wanted to share. On the afternoon of Sunday, July 6th, during a severe heat advisory, a significant fire broke out on the third floor of a triple-decker on Wheatland Street. The blaze spread rapidly, ultimately displacing all occupants of the affected building, as well as residents from an adjacent property. In total, 27 tenants were displaced. Some of the fire units arrived within minutes, worked aggressively to contain the fire, supported by multiple companies, including other cities. responding to the scene. The situation drew a large crowd on the street of onlookers while the arrival of the Red Cross usually takes some time, you know, creating an urgent need for immediate coordination of the displaced residents. At this critical moment, Health Inspector Stephanie Estrella arrived on the scene and quickly took charge of victim coordination. She organized residents away from the danger zone and out of the intense sun, gathering them safely under a nearby tree while firefighters continued operations. Inspector Estrella worked swiftly to collect critical information, ensuring that all displaced residents were accounted for. Despite language barriers, the emotional distress of the residents, and overall chaos of the scene, Inspector Estrella&#39;s communication remained clear, professional, and effective. She also demonstrated persistence in contacting the property owner to secure the site following the completion of firefighting efforts. Her actions provided vital support for both residents and emergency personnel, ensuring that victims received assistance in a timely and organized manner. Inspector Estrella&#39;s leadership and professionalism exemplify the City of Somerville&#39;s commitment to public safety and community well-being. So that said, I just wanna say from a personal standpoint, as a councilor, I&#39;ve been on the scene of a few fires since I&#39;ve been on the council, and one of the things we&#39;ve kind of struggled with as councilors is sort of what is the protocol around having city representation on the scene of a fire to do just this. I mean, this was a Sunday afternoon, and I understand that based on a lot of advocacy, there is protocols, but that does not take away from the fact that the individual who showed up was critical in making sure that these folks had the resources they need and were in touch with Red Cross. So that&#39;s why I, myself and Councilor Wilson, just recognize the immediate need on the scene and the fact that the right person came. You need somebody that&#39;s able and ready and able and willing to take charge and do the job that needs to be done, not just kind of stand around and try to figure out who&#39;s who. You need somebody who really shows leadership. And that&#39;s why I&#39;m presenting this this evening to Inspector Stephanie Estrella of ISD. and I&#39;ll read the, actually Councillor Wilson as my co-sponsor may wanna say a few words and then I&#39;ll read the citation and we&#39;ll present it.</td>

It&#39;s this past, a few weeks ago I was in D.C. and this is like the first time that I actually met like a lot of people like from Ukraine and I mean the shared joy that they have really took me off guard because when I was interacting with them I asked the question about like what is the situation in Ukraine because I know that it&#39;s like the war zone, they actually came like to this conference and Yet I could see that dim in their faces that said, hey, nothing has changed. They&#39;ve just become so normal to them that this is just part of their life. So I left that place feeling really moved. I said to myself that a city like Somerville has always long prided itself on being a welcoming and globally connected city. And we are committed to fostering cultural exchange, mutual understanding, and international friendship. So sister-sister relationship will strengthen people-to-people connections, create opportunities for cultural, educational, and economic exchange, and reaffirm the values of solidarity and cooperation. So the city of, you know, Pryluky, you know, shares common values of community resilience, innovation, and civic pride. So, and is seeking to deepen international partnership during a time of great challenge and rebuilding for Ukraine. and establishing a sister city relationship with Pryluky will allow Somerville to stand in solidarity with Ukrainian people, provide opportunities for cultural and educational exchange, and strengthen Somerville&#39;s commitment to democracy, peace, and global cooperation. Madam Clerk, would you please read the resolution?</td>

First, I would like to welcome our virtual guests who have joined us from Pryluky, Ukraine. Mayor Pompanko, most of us cannot fathom what you and your community have faced during this relentless war, but I do hope this step makes clear that our community wants to know you are not alone. I have no doubt that this partnership will strengthen our shared commitment to lasting and just peace for all, and to standing up to authoritarian regimes that threaten our safety and our democracy. As some in this chamber may already know, I was raised in a household with generational war trauma. This experience is woven into my visceral opposition for all war. My parents lived through World War II as youth. We are a family of immigrants carrying not just the history of our ancestors with us, but also the memory of war and destruction. My earliest years were spent among people who were still putting themselves and their countries back together from the ravages of that war. Even after the passage of decades, I know firsthand how war scars its survivors and how the weight of a thing that happened before you were born can be looming presence in your life. Earlier this summer, I was deeply saddened to read about a drone attack on the city of Pryluky. that claimed the lives of multiple family members of one of your firefighters. It was a heartbreaking reminder of the devastation this horrific war continues to cause. The city of Somerville looks forward to learning more about your resilience, and we hope to share how we at home are fighting our own little battle to safeguard democracy. Again, I want to thank Councillor Mbah for initiating this partnership and for the council supporting it. Our city looks forward to our future as your sister city, both as an opportunity to celebrate our communities and cultures, as well as to bolster our roles as a place of peace and progress. Thank you.</td>

This was very moving to hear directly from our colleagues in Ukraine. I think all of us know that it can feel like we have no power to influence international events, but I very firmly believe that actions like this can have a really meaningful effect. Growing up in Cambridge, there was a sister city relationship established with a village in El Salvador in the immediate aftermath of a brutal war there. As the populations of small villages were returning to the places that they had been made refugees from, they established sister city relationships. Cambridge has one with a place called San Flores. It&#39;s now been in operation for 35 years. There have been delegations almost annually. There are really deep and meaningful relations. They, in some cases, have been able to, you know, work with the State Department when things have been difficult. I really believe that things like this can make a difference. So again, through you, Mr. President, I want to thank you, Councillor Mbah. And also, during the speech from our colleagues in Ukraine, my colleague next to me pointed out that it is 2.30 in the morning where you all are. So that speaks to how moving this was. So thank you all. That&#39;s it.</td>

                <td>Council Burnley. Thank you through the chair. I wanna echo my colleagues thanks to Councilor Mbah for bringing this forward and for the mayor for taking whatever future steps necessary to establish this relationship. And I want to make sure that the folks in Ukraine know that when we walk around Somerville, we see your flags. We see them on homes. We see them in cafes. We see them painted on fences. Because the people of Somerville... are the world. We have people from all over this beautiful world of ours who are connected to your community and many others. And so I&#39;m really grateful to see this act because it reaffirms that connection from our community to yours. It makes clear a truth that is self-evident if we can all look it in the face, which is that We, all of us, are strengthened and our communities enhanced by having relationships in communication with people across the world and beyond our own borders. That does not stop at our country&#39;s borders, it does not stop at our Commonwealth&#39;s borders, and it does not stop at our city borders. We are better for connecting culturally and educationally to the experience of those even and especially who are different than us. So I&#39;m grateful for your presence here, and I&#39;ll try not to speak too long because I know maybe you could use some sleep. But I&#39;m grateful that Somerville, again, leads the way on confronting issues, whether big or small, local, statewide, or international. Thank you.</td>

So typically this type of a process would come to us with, My understanding is historically, the administration would have put a lot of work and laid some groundwork, and then we would approve it. This is an entirely appropriate way for us to start the conversation. There is, of course, work to be done to lay the sort of formal processes to build out the relationship. My understanding is the administration, as we&#39;ve heard, is certainly excited to move forward with that. Councillor Budd, do we want to... do we want to send this to committee so that the council has a sort of a formal process to participate in that conversation? We certainly could do that without it being in committee as well and we can put a new item in to send a new item in when we&#39;re ready for the formal procedure. I think that&#39;s probably the way I&#39;d lean, but Councilor Mbah, I&#39;m happy to hear any other preferences.</td>

                <td>Thank you. Good evening, councillors. Tonight, I&#39;m honored to present a proclamation recognizing Welcoming Week in Somerville beginning September 12th, 2025. Welcoming Week is a national celebration that reminds us that when communities are inclusive and open, everyone thrives. As you all know in Somerville, we don&#39;t just talk about diversity, we live it. Our neighborhoods are homes to people from across the globe and our cultures, schools, and economy are stronger because of it. But welcoming week is also about courage. It&#39;s about choosing connection over division, compassion over fear, and love over hate. At a time when too many voices across our nation seek to divide us, Somerville will always stand firm in our belief that every person deserves dignity, belonging, and opportunity. And while we officially mark Welcoming Week this September, the spirit of this week goes well beyond a single set of days. In Somerville, welcoming is year-round. It is embedded in how we treat our neighbors, how we shape our policies, and how we build a future where everyone belongs. I thank the Council for joining me in lifting up this moment. this important week and for standing with me as we say clearly, Somerville is and will remain a welcoming city. Thank you.</td>

The price was based on the prior owner having paid $1.2 million for the parcel within the prior year, and in part on what the planned use of the property was, which was for a two-story office building. When you go to eminent domain, the measure of the value is the highest and best use. So not just how the land was at the time it was taken, but what was the possible highest and best use for which the land could be used. It was a 7,000 square foot irregular shaped parcel. Each party had their own appraisers look at the value of the property. They both agreed that the highest and best use was for mixed commercial and residential. a five-story building, which would have been permitted under the prior zoning and perhaps under the new zoning as well. And they came up with a value that was $2,350,000 was our appraiser, $2,760,000 was the other appraiser. They met in the middle for a final value of $2,555,000. and the amount being requested will bring it up to that agreed upon total. Also, when a case has been in litigation for several years, parties can request, the plaintiff can ask for pre-judgment interest, and in consideration of the city&#39;s agreeing to settle this case, they waived all the pre-judgment interest that would have been owed on the taking.</td>

This is, I appreciate that summary, and I wanted to call out a couple things, one of which is that this is, I want to, this is a moment to celebrate, because the 217 Somerville Lab Park had its ribbon cutting just last week, and is already a very welcome space. It is some of the first, It is, I believe, the first public park that&#39;s been created by the city by taking property by eminent domain in at least 20 years. So it&#39;s an incredible act. It&#39;s also one that was driven by the city council. I can remember back in 2018 putting in the... the item calling for the eminent domain at the time for 1.2 million because that&#39;s exactly the price that was paid for this parcel. So tonight we are closing the door on Osaka. I certainly don&#39;t disagree with any of our legal strategy, but it does strike me as hard to swallow when the owner of this property has made a tidy $1.4 million profit for owning it for less than a year off the backs of the residents of the City of Somerville. So with that said, I thank all the staff that worked to make this acquisition happen and to work through settling this lawsuit. And I hope to see everybody down there in the King Kelly Park. I&#39;ll be the one sitting on the Rose Caterino bench. Thank you.</td>

Will each one be coming with a memo? Or do you see this as something that is relatively rare moving forward?</td>

The request before you is to transfer funds from salary contingency to the individual departments as we were developing the fiscal year 26 budget. The step increases for non-union employees, grades, sorry, yeah. Pay bands one through four, I&#39;m gonna get my terminology right. Pay bands one through four, two steps. That was discussed at budget time. This is the transfer to effectuate that. It happened really late in the budget process. We didn&#39;t want to re-import a full list of 1,500 employees, so we reserved the resources there and we&#39;re making this transfer now to make those departments whole for those adjustments. All right, thank you.</td>

I&#39;m gonna just make it clear what the intent is. And this is the unmet need that she actually says she brings this to me is the timely distribution of a plain language summary of changes to the city charter. which will be on our November 4, 2025 ballot, you know, as a ballot question. This distribution of the summary of the charter changes needs to be not only available on the city website, but it needs to be sent out in normal and even large print, print, as well as Braille and Bose copies in all languages in which the city usually makes information available. Without this, the city voters will be voting blind. So the way to make this kind of information mandatory over the years, the council will need to adopt mass general law Chapter 53, Section 18B. And at this point, I would like to, with your permission, Mr. President, I want to sponsor Harriet to speak to this policy order.</td>

                <td>My name is Harriet Ranvig. I live at 5 Lester Terrace in Davis Square. And I just came to speak on this matter as a matter of having a well-informed electorate because... Having time to read through these documents is very important, and to have a summary of the changes, considering there&#39;s been no changes since 1899, it feels to me that it is our duty to make this available to every voter in Somerville. And we went through a very difficult experience last year because, naturally, Secretary Galvin had the little red book sent out at least two months before the election. Whereas the Braille edition, because of various complexities of bureaucracy, was only presented to blind folks at the poll. And no fault of the poll workers, but having no experience of Braille, The two volumes was only one volume here and there. There was not a complete in the six polling places that I went to. So this is kind of to try to get a jump on it, number one. And number two, I am eager to read plain language summary of those changes because they will affect our city and how it moves and works for us. And this is also a part, after some research, of the Chapter 53, Section 18B of Mass General Law. How that interacts with the home rule petition, which I&#39;ve been told, I haven&#39;t read it for myself, is already in the Legislative House of Massachusetts. I do not know that interaction. And I just know that I think that everyone in this room is devoted to an electorate that has the information they need to vote intelligently and well concerning the charter. Thank you very much.</td>

I think this issue is, while... those and any other changes that, all of the rest of the changes are subject to the request here to provide that information in every accessible way we can. I&#39;m not sure I want to take those up right now, because I think this item is substantively a little different, unless there&#39;s a strong objection.

And I see you nodding your head, so I appreciate if the administration, obviously given the time sensitivity, I don&#39;t want to delay this, but I do think the actual substantive adoption of this law is appropriate for discussion in committee, but certainly we all recognize that there are some timing concerns, and so if the administration can take a look at those, take a look at the request, and as soon as reasonable, be able to speak to that in committee, that would be very much appreciated. All right, so seeing no further discussion, these two items are approved and sent to committee. Let&#39;s see who matters. First one, yes, thank you, thank you, thank you, because I put these together, my bad. Yes, first one placed on file, second one approved and sent to committee.

My understanding is that the Council has not officially received any further communication beyond these ones that are here, but I did want to keep these all together to have the full context. And because there were a few potential issues raised in those communications at the time, I asked through the Intergovernmental Affairs. It&#39;s getting late, folks. Through the Office of Intergovernmental Affairs, I had asked for someone in the administration to just take a look and be able to speak to us. We have Director Galgani here. Director Galgani, if you could just give us a quick sort of summary of your conclusions, if you have any concerns or if you feel like, or sort of your thoughts on some of the issues that were raised here, I won&#39;t us to have that context so that we can, if we decide to move forward, do so with full information.</td>

Are we going to see less homes constructed as a result? And is this going to increase costs for developers? Yes. Will this result in less homes being built? Possible. The real question is how many, and what is the scale of the problem, and what is the scale of what we&#39;re trying to solve? It&#39;s hard for us to quantitatively estimate what the impact, it might be some slight impact. Is this something that&#39;s going to collapse our residential market? We definitely think not. There are relatively few condo conversions that happen. Most of them that happen are with existing buildings. Some of them do result in demolitions and then larger units being built, but we don&#39;t see this as having a catastrophic effect on residents. Necessary thing that we need to do in order to protect our residents.</td>

That certainly, as you said, is not, it&#39;s not the majority of conversions, and I don&#39;t know what the percentage is, but the number of units wouldn&#39;t necessarily be impacted where a current X number of unit rental property was converted into the same X number of units condominiums. It&#39;d be obvious that if X remains the same number, it&#39;s the same number of units, correct?</td>

That will increase the cost of development, but we don&#39;t think it&#39;s gonna have such a detrimental impact that we should forego these changes. I think these changes are important, and I think it will make a difference for the people that we&#39;re trying to make this for.</td>

                <td> Thank you very much, through you, and thank you, Director and the administration, for continuing to push on this. I remain extremely supportive of this, and I just want to focus in. So we got one letter from the Chamber of Commerce that outlined why they were opposed to it. They say their objections are based on substance and process. The first thing that they mention on substance, they say the quote, the city&#39;s stated goals are to create more housing units of all kinds. As Somerville has little in the way of vacant land on which to build new housing, existing structures will have to be demolished in order to build more. This entails removing tenants from those existing structures with the goal of having more tenants in the new structure. So the stated reason for opposing this is that they want to make it easier to remove tenants. Those are our constituents. Those are the people literally who elect us. The idea that it is the city&#39;s stated policy that we want to make it easier to remove tenants from their homes just makes my blood boil. I almost can&#39;t put into words that they would have the first reason to us is that we want to make it easier to remove tenants from their existing homes. It boggles them up. I agree we need to build more housing. The types of condo conversions that I most frequently see, they&#39;re not adding units. They&#39;re taking a triple-decker, evicting everybody, and turning them into three condos. It is not the city&#39;s policy that we want to displace as many tenants as possible, and I just wanna state that for the record. And in those situations where tenants are going to be removed, because we can&#39;t prevent it fully, they deserve to land on their feet with reasonable relocation expenses and with a reasonable amount of time to find a new place to live. They&#39;re getting evicted. So that is why I remain extremely supportive of this, and I&#39;m thankful, honestly, for this argument being made in such clear terms.</td>

I believe there was a like half did one with someone where it was to the ward counselor and then I was like well the at-larges would like to know as well quite frankly that was a few years ago and I remember at the time the next fire that happened actually near me unfortunately I was alerted by the city so I know this can happen because it has happened once or twice before but it seems as though We start to move forward on this and then either people forget or it gets lost in the hustle bustle of running a city and unfortunately the need for this is really present. I mean we&#39;ve talked about, we&#39;ve mentioned two fires thus far that just happened recently. I also like to uplift that there was a fire on Thurston Street which caused soot to rain from the skies. I remember seeing it from afar because I live in the area. These are real people&#39;s lives. These are homes that are being destroyed or potential homes and future homes. And even if, you know, I&#39;m not saying every counselor is going to swoop in and try to, you know, run the show or do anything to that order, but I think it is very helpful when constituents see that their government is responsive and caring in those very difficult moments, so thank you.</td>

I just wanna first say that I know there&#39;s been a lot of conversations about what is the protocol, what is the process when there is an emergency. So the intergovernmental affairs team has started conversations with our director of emergency management to talk about how we can come to the council, maybe come before public health, public safety, to start having these conversation and talk about what actually happens when there is an emergency, what are the departments that are either onsite or respond right away to help our constituents. On the specific issue of notification to city council, I do wanna say that IGA, although we&#39;re not perfect, we do our best to notify and the ward counselor as soon as we hear of the emergency. It&#39;s not always in real time because in that moment, the departments that are onsite are focused on addressing the emergency. As soon as they are done addressing the emergency, IGA gets a notification and we reach out to the ward counselor right away. Just this morning, I reached out to a ward counselor at seven in the morning, and I know some of you have heard from me late at night as well. Although our current protocol is not to reach out at large, I&#39;d be happy to have conversations about what process works for everyone. So I just wanted to say that. Thank you.</td>

                <td> Thank you, Mr. President. So the way that I heard that the tier works in the talking of when the emergency management director came and spoke before the task force discussing ADA accessibility and updating protocol with that is that emergency management gets it gets the information and then I forgot the second tier and then it&#39;s supposed to go to IGA but again I&#39;m still confused as to why at-large counselors aren&#39;t included in the conversation And while I understand that it is important that ward councillors are aware that this is happening within their ward, say for instance Ward 7, which is kind of rogue right now, we don&#39;t have a Ward 7 councillor. And I&#39;ve gratefully taken on a lot of former councillor Pineda-Newfield work in her ward, and I&#39;m grateful to do that. But I do want to know and I don&#39;t want to leave our constituents just out in the cold and I still don&#39;t understand why at-large counselors aren&#39;t included in this process and I don&#39;t want to hear about it in a press release from the mayor&#39;s office in five days because I think it&#39;s really unfair. I know that in real time is a possibility because in a previous administration it was a very simple protocol that happened. And if it&#39;s the fire auxiliary that is giving a call or a volunteer that is giving a call to us, I think that&#39;s a very basic, basic request that we can ask for. So on record, I&#39;m asking that all counselors are informed when fires are happening in real time, just as you are aware of it, that we are aware of it as well. I would really like that and let our constituents know that we&#39;re there for them and they can see us. Because I have heard from constituents, where were you? No one was there. Nobody cares. I remember one story of a constituent saying that they actually came to City Hall. to the mayor&#39;s office after a fire. And this was only a couple of years ago. A fire just destroyed her unit and a couple of units in the building. And she was hoping that somebody somewhere in the city could guide her to resources basic resources after Red Cross left because then they were gone and and and she knew that that this was a possibility because she she had lived in Somerville all her life and I heard about it eight months later. And she carried that burden and that trauma that nobody cared. Nobody in the city of Somerville cared for over eight months. We were able to direct her to resources and gratefully there was a really happy story that ended from it. But it shouldn&#39;t be that. It should never be that. We shouldn&#39;t leave our residents, our constituents out in the cold. Thank you.</td>

This is something that, you know, when you mentioned that you will, you know, the protocol is to follow up with the ward councillor. Like councillor Strezo said, we don&#39;t have a ward councillor in ward seven. And yet there was a fire that occurred. I don&#39;t know like who you communicated that fire to. Like we were all left in the dark. So I think it would be good to I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s an ordinance that needs to be put in place for us to get information. I&#39;m not sure, but this is something that is just basic, you know, courtesy that we need to be having timely information so that we can be there for our residents and our neighbors. Thank you.

                <td> Okay, I wouldn&#39;t mind if Madam Clerk read it, but I&#39;m also going to summarize it quickly because it gets really technical real fast. But if you know the language, you know. Anyhow, some of the We first, 1 in 36 children have a form of Autistic Spectrum Disorder, ASD, including here in Somerville. And some of the first steps once a diagnosis is established with an autistic child is to help this child get basic life I wouldn&#39;t say life experiences, but life training. And some of that work is through BCBA, ABA, early intervention, which happens here in Somerville. And so with that, There&#39;s a list of providers that, a long list of families trying to get to providers for autistic support. And sometimes it is staggeringly long. And then don&#39;t even get me started on insurance companies and where that plays in, where you can get services, even just the simple diagnosis of autism. if you&#39;ve talked to your constituents, can be a year and a half, two years to wait to get to the right behavioral pediatrician specialist or department. It&#39;s a waiting game. And despite the fact that it is a very common diagnosis or it&#39;s becoming a more commonly diagnosed, it&#39;s not super common, but you know what I mean. Because of that, we should have more providers, we should have more services available, and yet we don&#39;t. So what this resolution is essentially saying is that there&#39;s an opportunity through MassHealth, a lot of children with autism may receive MassHealth. It opens up the process with this resolution if we can open up more opportunities levels of service providers to support autistic children and families that love support and care for them. We can do that if MassHealth and insurance companies can collaborate and if the state of Massachusetts will allow that. So just really quickly read this. The first years of life are the most consequential in human development. We know that. And despite everything we know about early intervention for children with ASD, Massachusetts has an acute shortage of key practitioners who are crucial in the provision of ABA services. which, like I said, ABA applied behavioral analysis, BCBA, resulting in a wait list of 2,000 to 3,500 children aged 2 to 5 years old at any given time. And the average age of a diagnosis in Massachusetts is 5.3 years old. I&#39;m not even talking about girls and the gender differences with that. Boys typically get diagnosed fastest. Girls can be diagnosed far later, if even at all at times. Massachusetts operates under a two-tier delivery model of ABA services rather than a three-tier delivery model like in California or Michigan. And what this resolution is fighting for is to open up to a three-tier model and with MassHealth&#39;s acceptance of that and insurance companies&#39; acceptance of that, that could be possible. So that&#39;s a brief 945 p.m. summary of this. And I am requesting that this be sent to the governor&#39;s office and our state delegation and that they advocate and fight for this as well.</td>

I met with the CEO at this conversation, but I said I&#39;ll be submitting a formal policy order. So as Somerville continues to advance its goals, for economic vitality, climate leadership and equity. It&#39;s important to assess how Greentown Labs operation align with this priority. You know, and such an assessment will allow us as a council to recognize the successes, identify areas for improvement, and ensure that the presence of Greentown Labs continues to advance some of its vision of an innovative, sustainable, and inclusive local economy.

But at the August 14 meeting of the Somerville Affordable Housing Trust, all the trustees welcomed the newest members, Abba, Solis, and approved the July 10 meeting. Financial reports show approximately 2.3 million available in CPA account, including the fiscal year 2025 allocation, 11.8 million in non-CPA account, and 50,000 in early action acquisition fund. The CPC approved returning 264,000 in CPA interest earned between fiscal year 2019 to 2025 to the trust. So the staff recommended allocating up to 400,000 in CPA funds for fiscal year 26 housing assistance program through a competitive RFP with evaluation criteria based on past program success, organizational capacity. So the trustee recruitment continues with interviews for the banking and finance, that was a seat that was open. And so they are scheduling an interview for that. They scheduled that already, I think August 20th. And there&#39;s some of the nonprofit seat also. There&#39;s a seat that&#39;s been opened. That seat has been re-advertised for mid to late September. It has the report be accepted as submitted. All right, thank you. That is placed on file. Next item.</td>

August 21st, the Job Creation Retention Trust voted to issue an RFP inviting job training and career counseling providers to compete for four or five grants of approximately $200,000 each, supporting ongoing programs for Somerville clients through fiscal year 2026 and into 2027. The trustees committed $1 million to this RFP despite concerns that with no new construction projects expected until the real estate market improves, spending now will be reduced to the trustee reserve to less than $2 million for a future period that could extend five or more years, potentially threatening its sustainability and the community organization it supports. So that&#39;s why I actually trigger the previous order in finance for those funds to look how we can subsidize and repurpose funds from the stabilization account. So I ask that this committee report be accepted and submitted. That item is placed on file.</td>

And she had just spent the summer working for the Cambridge DPW on a program where summer interns, they bike around the city and they fill up the tree water bags. They&#39;re taught how to connect to fire hydrants. And it happens kind of in addition to whatever is done, the contracts to keep the trees watered, which can always be supplemented. So we&#39;ve filed this order to ask the mayor&#39;s office and DPW to look into including a program like this. It really, it sounded like a just totally wonderful experience where they were just showered with appreciation from all the people who live there. They were increasing the tree canopy. You know, it&#39;s a win-win-win. And so I&#39;d ask that this please go to committee so we can follow up on.</td>

                <td>Thank you Mr. President. Normally I wouldn&#39;t take time to talk about an order like this, but I just want to clarify what I mean. When you&#39;re driving on Somerville Ave, right before you get to Gracie&#39;s, there are two lanes of traffic. One of them almost everyone wants to turn left. the right lane, everybody wants to go straight. That signal has been really screwed up. There have been a bunch of kind of inadvertent changes made. I&#39;ve gone back and forth a lot with the mobility department. But it&#39;s a very long red right now. And that red is intended to keep people from going straight when there&#39;s a red light 100 feet ahead of them. But it causes a huge backup for people that just need to be turning left. So I really think that there should just be a left turn arrow right there so that people obviously would still have your walk cycle. But for people turning onto Bo or Warren, just keep the traffic flowing so that it doesn&#39;t back up so far on Somerville Ave. So if this could go to traffic and parking for follow-up, I&#39;d appreciate it. All right. That is approved. Cocked traffic and parking.</td>

                <td> Thank you, Mr. President. In October of 2021, the city held its first community meeting about redesigning Highland Ave to make it safer. And when the city first held that meeting, this was under the previous administration, I was incredibly naive because I really genuinely thought that that was the beginning of a design and construction process. That was four years ago, and quite literally nothing has happened since then. A few months after that meeting, when the current mayor was inaugurated, there was basically a pause put onto all the major capital investments while the new administration developed their own priorities. I was very strongly publicly opposed to that pause as it pertained to this project. We were quite literally digging up Highland Ave at that time for utility work. And I remember I had worked with the incoming mayor when she was a counselor as the co-sponsor, kind of calling for protected bike lanes on Highland Ave. So I was already frustrated. This was in 2022, 2023. I fought really hard to make sure that despite that pause, there was still momentum. And indeed, when the current capital investment plan was put out, Highland Ave redesign was included there. And again, I must have been really naive because I thought that that was real. And for anyone who has been following this process, the line, has been that this process is going to start the summer of 2025. The city has a dedicated website. If you Google Highland Ave redesign, it has a dedicated website. The most recent update says, we can expect, and I quote, design and outreach funding for Highland Avenue available as soon as July 2025 and construction services funding starting July 2026. I believe that. I really, I didn&#39;t think that that was a misdirect. July 2025 has now come and gone. Obviously, that community process has not begun. From what I can tell, it is not planned to begin. I have not been given any timeline or any commitment. Instead, what I have been told is that the mayor&#39;s office is aware that I would like to know when the Highland Ave community process is going to begin. What I find really, really, really frustrating is when I feel like I am being misled. It is really hard to work together to find common ground when I feel like I am not being given honest answers from the mayor&#39;s office. This is not directed at the mobility department or anyone else. This is about the mayor&#39;s office who is responsible for making the big decisions around capital priorities that cost a lot of money. And when we mislead the public for years at a time, it breaks the trust that we all have to work so hard to build up with residents, and it is incredibly difficult to rebuild, and it does not need to be this way. It has been generically explained to all of us that we are in really brutal economic forecasts. This has made it necessary for us to rethink what are the expensive things that we&#39;re gonna pay for. I get that. Okay, say that. Tell us that you are changing the priority and that you&#39;re going back on the commitment to redo Highland Ave or that it&#39;s being delayed five years or whatever. Tell us what the plan is. Instead, what we&#39;re getting is there are statements made in public in meetings on the website repeatedly that are just not true. And it is honestly driving me insane. I would just respect it a whole lot more if the mayor&#39;s office said, look, we&#39;re not doing Highland Act right now. Instead, what we just get is this like silent non-response every time this comes up. And the deadlines come and go. One of the things that I hear the most about, about the community path, now that it is open, is that there are way too many bikers going way too fast. And that is obviously true. I have little kids. You basically can&#39;t take little kids on the new parts of the community path because there are people biking like psychos. The way to get people off the community path is to get a bike lane on Highland Ave. For the commuters, there needs to be bike lanes on Highland Ave. So I&#39;m just begging the mayor, prove me wrong. Tell me that I&#39;ve got it all wrong and that I&#39;m being passive aggressive. Just show me that you&#39;re actually gonna start this community process and I will stop talking about this. But from where I sit, it&#39;s just been all talk. It&#39;s just been years and years of misleading me and the public about that we&#39;re actually gonna do this. I don&#39;t think this needs to go to committee. I think I&#39;ve made myself clear, but I would really like to see some action.</td>

We sent a nomination for zoning board of appeals to confirmation appointments. We approved the appointment of a member to the forestry committee and we sent a copy of the mayor&#39;s communication on updates to school building facilities committee to school buildings facilities and maintenance.

As you heard earlier, the House has approved it and it&#39;s been sent to the Senate where it will need to be approved there and then by the governor. Then we&#39;ll get the vote on it if hopefully that all happens. All right, so that is placed on file.</td>

The front page, first item on the Somerville Times as of this week is Committee Recommends a Safer Union Square. And that is a direct result of the good work of the folks at PTAC, pedestrian transit advisory committee who did a walk audit in Union Square that I know a number of my colleagues were there for as well as the mayor, at least for portions. There are some great recommendations in there. There are short-term and long-term goals. I am not unreasonable I don&#39;t think that we&#39;re going to get a report from the administration that we&#39;re gonna Institute these major street changes including widening of sidewalks within the next few weeks that would be incredible but there are some short-term goals including signal changes that can be made at some of the Union Square intersections that can increase safety based on the assessment of PTAC. So I would just like to see this conversation flourish and probably in Councilor Sait&#39;s committee.</td>

                <td>Councillor Burnley. Thank you, I&#39;m gonna try to be brief with this one, but there is a bit of history and it&#39;s an interesting case. 161 Broadway currently is a automotive garage and used car dealer right on Broadway. It&#39;s very public. It&#39;s actually a building of historic significance as it&#39;s been around since the time of Ford and some of the earliest car shows. We have an opportunity right now to see that space be a hub of innovation through the partnership and sharing of space with a local company that makes sweaters automatically, automated sweater manufacturing through Topologic. If you read the resolution, the information&#39;s all in there, quite frankly. city staff reached out to me as chair of licenses and permits and spoke to me about the potential opportunity to create more jobs in the community to all have civic space in our great community as if this Contract goes through, after hours the space would be open to the public for socializing and what events the community would like to see. It sounds really good, I would like for us to have more conversation about it, but the real sticking point is the fact that this is currently a business that is licensed as, again, a used car dealer and a garage. The owner of this building would not like to give up those licenses while the startup is operating in that space. Even if they&#39;re not actually filling the space with cars, they want to be able to have the ability to do so if this startup does not last for eight years, for example. Typically the process is, as anyone who&#39;s been on license and permits knows, we approve licenses every year when they get renewed. And in order to assuage this business owner, they would like to know that we will continue to approve those items while Topologic, this automotive sweater company, is operating in the space. Now, of course, no councilor can make judgments for future councils or future councilors, but based on conversations with city staff, this seems like a great opportunity to bring some needed energy and excitement into East Somerville. And I just wanna bring it to my colleagues to say, We have the power to make this possible and to make it happen.</td>

I&#39;ll request this either go to finance, given the capital investment element there, or to open space. on both of those, so I don&#39;t really care. Officer Scott, did you wanna?</td>

Let&#39;s have a good talk about underground infrastructure and hopefully get the thumbs up that everything&#39;s moving along quickly.</td>

This came in, I think, a couple years ago. But if you don&#39;t live in one of those buildings, if you live in a larger building with seven or more units, what then? I was approached by a constituent this week who lives in one of those larger buildings and they wanna know what to do with their mattress. So I offered to come and pick it up for her and dispose of it myself, but that&#39;s not really a solution. I think it behooves us to have good info out there for folks in those situations. So let&#39;s make sure we have that and that we get that out to folks. Further discussion?</td>
