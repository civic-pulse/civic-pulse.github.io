And just for context, for my colleagues who may have not been here in this committee for previous discussions of this matter, this was an item brought forward by Councillor Scott, who was following up on a years long concern by this council to reduce the number of double poles in the city. This is something that councillors for many years have tried to deal with, have gotten the run around, because the polls are owned by several different companies. And each company is not allowed to move other companies&#39; polls. And thus, we now have before us a number of folks representing Comcast, RCN, and Ebersource, who I believe I would ask to raise your hands. I see some of you in the audience, but please raise your hand so you can be unmuted. And I will note also for my colleagues, we did receive a list of polls throughout the city. I&#39;m not entirely sure if these were all the polls in the city or simply the double polls, but perhaps the stakeholders who are joining us today can be a bit more illuminating on what we have before us. With that, this is not a public hearing, but I&#39;d love for the folks who are joining the call to introduce themselves, which company they work for, and then we&#39;ll get into some questions.</td>

This item came before the council months ago. We had a previous conversation just to make sure that we could get all the stakeholders together to make sure that progress was being made.

                <td> Yes, sure thing. I can take that. Engines is the National Joint Utility Notification System. In simplest terms, it&#39;s an online system. tool, if you will, where utilities can go in and enter or submit what we call tickets. They&#39;re known as double, we conduct what&#39;s known as a double poll survey sheet. And then those are typically handed to our clerk at Eversource. And then the clerk will enter said tickets into the engine system. Without getting into too, too much details, what that basically does is create, again, a ticket where we have an approximate address, a poll number, and that&#39;s where really Eversource goes in and they say, okay, our primary&#39;s been transferred at the very top. If there is a secondary, the secondary itself has been transferred, and then the overhead supervisor will say, okay, NTG, what we call, or next to go is Comcast, is Astound, is Verizon, or whomever is on that poll, in no particular order. And my understanding is that the utility that&#39;s next to go will receive kind of an alert, notifying them that they&#39;re next to move on said pole. And the goal being that we always start from the top and then work our way down. Other attachments on the poles could be streetlights that the city may or may not own, wires from fire departments and some other infrastructure. But really, those are the main ones. Hope that adds some clarity.</td>

Again, that&#39;s really a ballpark number itself. What I will say is shortly before this meeting, we did have our clerk poll next to go as an engines. And I think we&#39;re in the ballpark of probably six pending transfers, meaning the poll has been set, Eversource is, it&#39;s on us to move next. I believe there are approximately seven to 10 pole poles. So I would say that once those, in essence, those pole poles are removed, then, you know, to me, that&#39;s checking the boxes, another double pole that&#39;s been removed from the inventory on the street.</td>

I think, you know, working with Jesse in his daily drive around if you will in the city if he sees a double pole he&#39;ll make note of it and put it into the spreadsheet that being said again engines is the really the governing tool that&#39;s used that also being said you know we have I know Angela very well we&#39;ve worked with Astound Verizon and others so when there&#39;s a pole that may be chunked chunked being it&#39;s cut out from the bottom or you know we&#39;ll say a priority every double pole is a priority don&#39;t get me wrong but if there&#39;s a you know, a poll at a busy intersection or has been, as we discussed there, for perhaps too long, we&#39;ll coordinate with other utilities to say, you know, the poll number, it&#39;s been set. We&#39;ve been off of it. Primary, secondaries, you know, utility X, you&#39;re next to move. And more often than not, they&#39;re very responsive to that.

                <td> Thank you, Mr. Chair. Brilliant setup for the segue into my comment, which is that, and I suppose in terms of, you know, whether it&#39;s this item or maybe a more specific item based on what I&#39;m about to say, but either way, let me ask first before I make the request, you know, given the database that you have, that you&#39;ve described here, the engine database, what would it take to, you know, at some periodic timeframe report, whether it&#39;s quarterly, annually, whatever, present to the council something that would be more easily digestible to show here&#39;s the double poles that we&#39;ve removed from the last time we had the conversation. And I ask that because, let me take a step back now, As the good councilor at large, Chair Burnley noted, this is a conversation that&#39;s been going on for a long time. From the day I stepped onto the council almost 10 years ago, my predecessors were talking about double poles and seeing what we can do to get rid of them. I imagine that new double poles... are created on occasion for safety reasons. You need to shore something up or whatever the case may be. I don&#39;t know, but I assume that&#39;s probably the case. And so I very much appreciate y&#39;all coming here, very much appreciate the explanation of the information. We can clearly see how this is the process and looking even at this static list, whether it&#39;s the right, the current accurate list or not, now that I understand what it is, I can see how it how it is a living document that facilitates the removal of these polls ultimately. And so that&#39;s great. I think it might be, and let&#39;s frame it in the way of like an even better story to tell, an even more clear story to tell to the next time we have this conversation, if it&#39;s possible to prepare something without too much extra work, having this current status would be good. But also, since the last time we had the conversation, here&#39;s the double polls that have since been completed and the poll has been pulled, right? If everything you&#39;re saying here and you&#39;re explaining it is true and I have no reason to believe it&#39;s not, let&#39;s tell the good story, right? Let&#39;s put some numbers to the actual action so folks can see, yep, it&#39;s happening. You&#39;ve explained it&#39;s a lot of work. There&#39;s a lot of moving parts, so we get that. But I think if there&#39;s a way to include a spreadsheet or something that shows the completed the completed tickets, I think that would be really helpful. It&#39;d be good for folks to see the definitive end result of all the work that you&#39;re all doing to address this issue, which is a big concern for a lot of folks. We hear about it a lot. Is that something that would be reasonable to request for like a future meeting?</td>

Chair Max Fennell, You know, in a conference room and. and work through listings together. We can certainly go back to January 1st, but I think at least in my mind, it might be productive to maybe we take this list that&#39;s in front of us now and we run it and maybe reconvene in another six months and say, since our last meeting on June 25th, this is the progress that we&#39;ve made. Again, we can certainly go back to January. If we want to tell the story of the locations of the polls that have been pulled and replaced, certainly happy to do that. Or we can start fresh from today on this list and re-examine progress made six months from now. Both clearly work, but I guess I would defer to the council counselors on what you all would prefer.</td>

                <td> Um, so Mr. Chair, if I might follow up, um, through you to Mr. Wright, thank you for that. Um, that, that sounds great. I was actually thinking the exact same thing, like maybe, uh, uh, you know, twice a year, um, check in and unless other folks feel strongly that it should be, you know, a quarterly, but, you know, given all the other stuff that we have, all the other business we have to, to take care of that, that may be not, maybe not the right, uh, right. Um, you know, sequencing, um, but, but not sequencing, um, You know what I mean? A number of times a year. It&#39;s been hot the last few days. So that was what I was thinking was twice a year, if other folks agree. And as far as going back, you know, yeah, it might, at least for maybe the next meeting, it might be nice to see, you know, go back one or two periods or whatever&#39;s easy. You know, if one period is easy and going back two periods would be not, then fine. And my thought would be like, then, you know, then I think to the extent that we have continuity, you know, at least, and we&#39;ll have the legislative record, you know, we can see like, all right, what&#39;s the pace? What&#39;s the, how is this working? I think that if, you know, if we see that there&#39;s still concerns, maybe then, you know, a working group or that sort of thing might make sense. And I certainly don&#39;t want to tell the administration how to do their job. So if folks in the administration feel differently, then I 100% would defer to them. But my thought would be is you&#39;ve clearly described there&#39;s a process as long as we see that that&#39;s working and there aren&#39;t other unrelated concerns coming up. I think that strikes me as a good way to kind of track this. I think it&#39;d be really useful and I&#39;d love to be able to point folks to check out licenses and permits on this date. You&#39;ll see the list of the polls that they&#39;ve completed, the ones they&#39;re working on. I send folks links to these meetings frequently because then you&#39;ve got that agenda, that item attached agenda, and they can see it themselves. As I said, let&#39;s tell the good story, all I do in the work, if we can sort of present it in a way that shows that a little more clearly, I think folks would appreciate that. So I agree with that approach, Mr. Chair, defer to my colleagues on the right way to go forward, but that was my thought. Thank you for the time.</td>

I&#39;m the regional director of state government affairs for Verizon. I actually pulled this list this morning from Engines, so it is a correct double poll list. This does indicate every double poll that is in the city right now and which state it&#39;s in next to go. means who the polls waiting on to move the balls in their court. I would be happy and can send this list over to you whenever you&#39;d like it. It takes me a second to just pull the list. So it gives you an idea. I apologize because I&#39;m in a rest area on the Mass Pike, but if I remember correctly from what I pulled today, I think there&#39;s about 110 double poles right now that are sitting in your city. And in various areas, again, with various folks who are next to go on that poll, which would, again, move the poll over to the next party. And at the end of the day, once everybody&#39;s off that poll, I go last. Right now, there are no double polls in the city for me to take action on. But when they do get to me, I do my transfer and we take the poll away. So. I&#39;m happy to answer any questions that you have as well.</td>

And I appreciate you making yourself available for this meeting, even while you&#39;re in transit there somewhere. So I&#39;m very grateful for that. So first, just to, this is, so this list is four pages, I believe, the version that I pulled up. Separately is correct. You mentioned there&#39;s about 100 polls or so. I see a number of polls, if I&#39;m looking at the column that says poll number at the top, that there&#39;s telco poll number, elco poll number, but excuse me, it looks like a number of those are the same number. So does that mean it&#39;s the same poll, even though the street name might be different, like that little corner or something?</td>

It could be, you know, depending on what street it&#39;s on, a poll number could repeat, for example. You definitely would see that. It&#39;s not the same poll.

In some fashion, a lot of them just, they actually have a tab at one point with a colored, with initials and a phone number on it, right wrapped around the cable in some points. So we will go out and we&#39;ll investigate to try to figure out who that actually belongs to. So we can say, hey, first of all, you need to be on record and using engines.

I&#39;m just kind of as like the new guy in the conversation.

And hopefully this will, this can just be a fruitful conversation and collaboration that ultimately sees that list go from 110, ultimately down to a much, much more manageable number. All right.

                <td>Good evening, everyone. I wanted to give you a brief update on what&#39;s been going on with closed captioning and also a little bit about sort of just this moment that the business community is in. So I will be honest, we have not done that much in terms of outreach on closed captioning. The licensing staff have sent out to all of our licensed restaurants information about the change that occurred with the new law. But that&#39;s really the extent of the outreach that we&#39;ve done. From Economic Development&#39;s perspective, this ordinance is a little bit tricky for us to be doing outreach on. Because there isn&#39;t an enforcement side of it, if we are then the first ones to convey that information, we are going to be seen as an enforcement of that ordinance. And we are not the enforcement agent. As we&#39;ve talked about in the context of other topics, we are carrots folks. We are not stick folks. And so it&#39;s become a little bit tricky for us to figure out how to navigate implementing this ordinance at this particular moment in time. And that&#39;s where I want to pivot a little bit to tell you all just a little bit about what we&#39;re hearing from our business community. Our business community at the moment is particularly our small businesses, and that&#39;s who we&#39;re worried about with the implementation side of this closed captioning ordinance. are really feeling a tough pinch when it comes to regulation and feeling like the eyes are on them. When city staff show up in a business at this particular moment in time, there is an immediate fear that you are someone official and therefore you might be affiliated with immigration enforcement. Immigration enforcement is hitting several businesses as well as every business across the country. And so there is really an importance of trust in our staff that we are trying to really sustain right now and focus on that relationship and ensuring that we are seen as a trusted folks. So when we are showing up, that they know our faces and that they know that we are coming with resources and connection and support. That makes this moment even harder for us to have these conversations around closed captioning because there isn&#39;t the mental bandwidth in our business community to be receptive to this implementation of something that is not top of line. Our businesses are grappling with the immigration issue affecting our immigrant owners, but also, of course, every business that has immigrants on their staff, and that is a wide range. And as the policies shift in Washington, continues to be a broadening range of folks who are affected. So when we&#39;re coming and we&#39;re talking with them, we&#39;re really nervous about how to engage on this particular topic. We know it&#39;s an important constituency that we want to serve by adding closed captioning in our publicly available televisions. But we&#39;re also trying to navigate these relationships with those business owners, many of whom have televisions not for their customer, but for themselves. And so we&#39;re trying to figure out what the right pathway here forward is. At the moment, the best that we really think that we can offer is to work on a case by case basis as requested. We&#39;re not sure who those requests would be coming from. Again, without that enforcement side of this picture spelled out. If someone does have a complaint, if it comes from a clinician on disability, again, we&#39;re happy to help navigate the relationship with the business owner, help them figure out what it looks like to turn on closed captioning, how to get there. But in terms of broad outreach, we&#39;re really struggling to figure out how to get there at this particular moment in time in a way that isn&#39;t going to sour our relationships with the small business community.</td>

                <td>All right. Just, again, for some context on the item, it is my item. This is something that I brought up quite a while ago. I&#39;ve been sitting in committee. But let&#39;s say, well, I think I brought it at the beginning of the year, actually. I&#39;m not looking at the date it was introduced specifically, but I know that there were conversations had before the beginning of this year. At that time, the conversation of the difficulty of implementation was not related to ICE, at least not explicitly, or the federal government as it was constituted at the time. But there were similar concerns around who&#39;s the carrot, who&#39;s the stick, maintaining relationships with the small businesses. The fundamentals have not changed on this conversation, I guess I&#39;m getting at. The context in which it exists as the context of everything that exists now in politics and government has shifted, of course. But I want to acknowledge both of those things, which is there was, I would say, some hesitance and potentially confusion about how enforcement and implementation would work prior to the current federal administration. I can&#39;t say I&#39;m surprised to hear that the occupants has made this conversation more difficult because that&#39;s in the White House, occupant of the White House, because that tends to be how that goes with most issues that I can think of. But I guess to get to a question, the ordinance itself does, somewhat empower the Commission for Persons with Disabilities to take a more of a role in inciting complaints, let&#39;s say. Has your office had any chance to speak with the commission about how they would like to see outreach around this or what they&#39;re seeing in the community?</td>

                <td>OK. Well, I would, again, this is a suggestion. not a order or a law in and of itself, I would suggest reaching out to see if they have any thoughts or feelings regarding this ordinance. Both from a necessity standpoint, but also from a standpoint of the availability of post captioning throughout the community. I&#39;ve certainly seen some businesses take to this pretty simply and pretty easily. I&#39;ve certainly also seen businesses that are hesitant to, or reluctant to, or I&#39;ll say resentful of the idea of any additional impositions on them or their operations. I have to imagine that there is some role or body currently within the city that could continue to do outreach around this. I guess another question, and then I&#39;ll open it to my colleagues if they have anything they&#39;d like to ask or add. How often is the department planning to include information about closed captioning in their outreach to local businesses? I know when the ordinance was passed, there was a a large mailing, but are those kind of mailings annual? Do they simply happen when new businesses open? What&#39;s the process around that?</td>

                <td> Michael Platera might be able to better speak to this because those mailings were done as part of the annual renewal process for licenses. Again, I think one of the things that&#39;s ultimately challenging about this is the scope of the televisions that we are talking about. Most of the business, like most of the public-oriented businesses, public-oriented televisions are going to be captured in that list, but definitely not all of them. And I think this ends up being the layer of challenge on the implementation front of how to get that out there. We aren&#39;t licensing televisions, as far as I know, but maybe we are. And apologies if I don&#39;t fully understand the whole picture. But again, from our perspective in economic development, our role is to help the business navigate that process. The enforcement side of it would come through licensing or inspectional services.</td>

When we issue new licenses, we do not specifically reference this portion of the ordinance or any portion of the ordinance in particular, and we do leave it to businesses themselves to familiarize themselves with the local laws, state and local laws. There is a mechanism specifically written into the ordinance that allows folks to submit complaints to the licensing commission through one of two forms that we have linked on the licensing commission website. I just went through them as we were speaking. I do not see any complaints with regard to this ordinance. having been filed since we opened up those forms back in 2023. If we were to receive such a complaint, we would absolutely refer this to the chair of the Licensing Commission for follow-up based on their judgment. So happy to answer any of the questions about that from the Licensing Commission side.</td>

Do wish that, you know, maybe there wasn&#39;t a feeling of sort of friction or tension around this issue. But, you know, I just wanted to weigh in just to reiterate for anyone who happens to be coming up on this discussion that, you know, what this ordinance requires is simply if you have a television and it has closed captioning, turn it on. That&#39;s it, right? If it doesn&#39;t, you&#39;re good, no worries. It&#39;s simply, if you have the button to push, push the button. And so hopefully if, like I said, if complaints do come in or if more folks do become aware of the ordinance, they&#39;ll understand that it&#39;s really intended to be, while very meaningful for folks for whom quick caption is the only way they can fully participate in viewing something, um it&#39;s tend to be a soft touch right and so um i just wanted to reiterate that fact that was very much part of the conversation when um the good chair and i were both in a different committee i&#39;m putting this uh putting this together with with the uh input assistance from director narkani and others um you know but it it While I understand all of the other context that maybe creates that friction, the ordinance itself is really pretty soft, right? If you have it, turn it on. That&#39;s all, right? That&#39;s all, Mr. Chair. Thank you.</td>

                <td>Thank you. And I&#39;ll just add on to that a little bit. And I did not feel the need to give too much context of the ordinance, knowing that Councilor Davis was there when it was written and drafted. But the council intentionally did not include any signs associated with this ordinance, did not include any heavy hand intentionally, because this is meant to be an inclusion of members of our community in the same way that the city now has a Braille, for example, which can be used for folks who want to engage with city processes, but would have otherwise had to wait weeks potentially to even have materials to look at. I think I&#39;m personally satisfied with that response at this point. As I mentioned before, I do think that there are ways that we can continue to do outreach to local businesses, but frankly, also to the public. I&#39;ll note as someone who has passed a number of laws, some of which come with the need to call 311 if you have an issue, a lot of people don&#39;t call 311. A lot of people don&#39;t know that they can reach out to make certain complaints. I want to be mindful of that as well. And, uh, I, I believe that there&#39;s a way to, um, strategize around how best to make sure that, uh, the public is aware of this, uh, and that there can be a more of a sense of collaboration around this rather than, um, scolding or, uh, forcefulness in its implementation. Director, did you want to add on something?</td>

                <td>Yeah, I definitely appreciate that sentiment. I think that&#39;s been our concern is really how do we carry that message about it being collaborative? I think the fact that it is tied to the license, there&#39;s a, again, there&#39;s a lot of risk right now, right? Our business owners are really feeling that like, Are you really like, I can, I can, I&#39;m anticipating the conversation of, wait a second, there&#39;s another thing I have to think about. I&#39;m already worrying about my pricing changing every single day. And I&#39;m already worrying about that, like that person who walked by and looked in the window and stared might&#39;ve been somebody who was going to report on my staff person. down the road. And I&#39;m, and I like the, the level of anxiety that our business owners feel on a daily basis and it&#39;s extra heightened right now, but it&#39;s, it doesn&#39;t ever really go below a near boiling point for a small business owner that like figuring out a way to share this information in a way that doesn&#39;t come across as, um, An extra level of scrutiny is a delicate balance. And that&#39;s been my concern from the beginning with this is how do we share that information? I don&#39;t know that my team being the ones who are the first purveyors of that information is going to lead to a positive result because they&#39;re used to coming to our team with saying, I got this information. I need help navigating. Help me figure out how to get through it. our team is really, really strong in their ability to do that. We have a lot of trust in our business community to come to our team and ask when they&#39;ve got a question of, there&#39;s this thing I didn&#39;t know I need to do, help me get there. But if we&#39;re the ones carrying the first message of you have to do this thing, that I worry will erode that trust in turning to us when it comes to time to actually do the thing and get and seek help.</td>

I appreciate the comment around delicate balance, and I would just emphasize the balance piece, which is, it&#39;s not nothing, it&#39;s not all, but it is a balance, which means when we have laws, they should mean something, but also they don&#39;t have to mean big government staring over your shoulder and telling you how to live your life. Any other comments from committee members? All right. Seeing none, I&#39;m going to ask that the clerk marks this work complete at this point. And that, I see that Councilor Pineda-Newfeld motions to adjourn. Can we get a roll call on that?</td>
