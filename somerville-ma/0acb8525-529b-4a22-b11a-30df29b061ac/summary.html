<h3 id="3-discussion-on-transfers-pole-removals-and-other-overhead-service-id-24-1777">3. Discussion on Transfers, Pole Removals, and Other Overhead Service (ID 24-1777)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Origin:</strong> Item brought forward by Councilor Scott to address the long-standing issue of double poles in the city.</li>
<li><strong>Attendees:</strong><ul>
<li>Jackie Duffy (Eversource)</li>
<li>Jason Wright (Eversource)</li>
<li>Angela Holm-Barson (Comcast)</li>
<li>Ellen Cummings (Verizon)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Definition of "Engines":</strong> Jason Wright (Eversource) explained "Engines" as the National Joint Utility Notification System, an online tool where utilities submit "tickets" for double pole surveys. Eversource enters these tickets, and once their primary and secondary lines are transferred, the "next to go" utility (e.g., Comcast, Astound, Verizon) is notified to move their attachments. The goal is to work from top to bottom, with Eversource removing the old pole once it's "naked."</li>
<li><strong>Progress on Double Poles:</strong><ul>
<li>Jason Wright estimated that approximately a dozen poles have been removed since the last discussion.</li>
<li>Currently, there are about six pending transfers (Eversource has moved, waiting for others) and seven to ten pole removals (poles ready to be pulled).</li>
<li>The time from a pole being on the "next to go" list to full removal can vary from months to years.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>List of Double Poles:</strong><ul>
<li>Ellen Cummings (Verizon) provided a current list of double poles pulled from Engines that morning, indicating approximately 110 double poles in the city.</li>
<li>She clarified that "next to go" indicates which entity is responsible for the next action.</li>
<li>"NPSL" (Non-Participating) indicates entities not registered with Engines or untagged cables, which require investigation to identify the owner.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> All utility representatives emphasized ongoing collaboration with the city and other utilities to address double poles, especially for priority poles (e.g., busy intersections, safety hazards).</li>
<li><strong>Future Reporting:</strong> Councilor Davis suggested a periodic report (e.g., semi-annually) to the Council detailing progress on double pole removals, including a list of completed removals and a glossary of acronyms used in the Engines system. This would enhance transparency and demonstrate progress to the public.</li>
<li><strong>Committee Decision:</strong> The committee decided to keep this item in committee for future follow-up, likely at the end of the year or beginning of next year, with the expectation of receiving updated information and a glossary of terms.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Outcome:</strong> Item kept in committee.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="4-update-on-closed-captioning-ordinance-outreach-id-24-0107">4. Update on Closed Captioning Ordinance Outreach (ID 24-0107)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Origin:</strong> Item by Councilor Burnley, Jr., requesting an update from the Director of Economic Development on efforts to inform businesses about the closed captioning ordinance.</li>
<li><strong>Speaker:</strong> Director Tarni (Economic Development)</li>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Limited Outreach:</strong> The Economic Development Department has done limited outreach on the ordinance. Licensing staff sent information to licensed restaurants about the change.</li>
<li><strong>Departmental Role:</strong> Director Tarni explained that the Economic Development Department's role is to provide "carrots" (resources, support) rather than "sticks" (enforcement). They are not the enforcement agent for this ordinance.</li>
<li><strong>Challenges:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Business Community Anxiety:</strong> Small businesses are currently experiencing significant anxiety due to various regulations and, specifically, fear of immigration enforcement. City staff showing up can be perceived as enforcement, potentially eroding trust.</li>
<li><strong>Mental Bandwidth:</strong> Business owners lack the "mental bandwidth" to be receptive to new regulations that are not top-of-mind priorities.</li>
<li><strong>Relationship Preservation:</strong> The department prioritizes maintaining trusted relationships with business owners, many of whom have televisions for personal use, not solely customer viewing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Proposed Approach:</strong> The department plans to work on a case-by-case basis as requested, assisting businesses with turning on closed captioning if a complaint is received (e.g., from the Commission for Persons with Disabilities).</li>
<li><strong>Commission for Persons with Disabilities:</strong> Director Tarni confirmed no recent conversations with the Commission for Persons with Disabilities regarding the ordinance since its drafting. Chair Burnley suggested reaching out to the Commission for their thoughts on outreach and community needs.</li>
<li><strong>Licensing Commission's Role:</strong> Michael Pottier (Licensing Operations Manager) stated that the Licensing Commission sent an email to all licensees on December 28, 2023, before the ordinance took effect. New licensees are expected to familiarize themselves with local laws. The Licensing Commission website has forms for complaints, but no complaints have been filed regarding this ordinance since 2023.</li>
<li><strong>Ordinance Intent:</strong> Councilor Davis and Chair Burnley reiterated that the ordinance is a "soft touch," requiring businesses to simply turn on closed captioning if their television has the capability. It was designed for inclusion, not heavy-handed enforcement.</li>
<li><strong>Future Outreach:</strong> Chair Burnley acknowledged the delicate balance and suggested exploring ways to inform the public and businesses collaboratively, without creating undue anxiety or appearing overly scrutinizing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Outcome:</strong> Item marked as work complete.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="adjournment">Adjournment</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Motion:</strong> Councilor Sait moved to adjourn the meeting.</li>
<li><strong>Vote:</strong><ul>
<li>Councilor Davis: Yes</li>
<li>Councilor Sait: Yes</li>
<li>Chair Burnley: Aye</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Outcome:</strong> The meeting was adjourned (3 in favor, 0 opposed, 0 abstentions).</li>
