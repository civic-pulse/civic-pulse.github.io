<h3 id="4-44-white-street-waiver-request">4. 44 White Street (Waiver Request)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li>Attorney Ann Vigorito, representing the applicant, stated this was a waiver request, not a public hearing, for a Traffic Impact Study (TIS).</li>
<li>Stephen Serragusa from Bowman Consulting, on behalf of the applicant, explained that a parking utilization study and memo were submitted to understand the parking situation.</li>
<li>Greg Hennepin, Transportation Planner in the Mobility Division, stated that the project is in an MR-4 district within a transit area, allowing 0.5 vehicle parking spaces per dwelling unit (1.5 spaces for a three-unit building, rounded down to 1 allowed space).</li>
<li>Hennepin noted that residents of this building are not eligible for on-street parking permits.</li>
<li><strong>Mobility Division Position:</strong> The Mobility Division does not believe a parking utilization study of the surrounding area is relevant for exceeding a parking maximum in this specific case, as residents cannot utilize on-street parking. Therefore, the Mobility Division supports the applicant's request for a waiver of the TIS.</li>
<li><strong>Board Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li>Chair Capuano noted that both the applicant and Mobility Division were in agreement regarding the waiver.</li>
<li>No questions or comments were raised by Planning Board members regarding the waiver request.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Action:</strong> The Chair moved to waive the requirement for a TIS report for 44 White Street.</li>

<h3 id="5-199-elm-street-continuance-from-previous-meeting">5. 199 Elm Street (Continuance from Previous Meeting)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Applicants:</strong> Pablo Picker (Developer), Paul Miller (Principal Architect, Neighbor Architects), Curtis (Landscape Architect)</li>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li>Pablo Picker and Paul Miller presented updates in response to comments from the previous meeting, focusing on public art/mural components and building articulation.</li>
<li><strong>Design Options for Building Articulation and Mural:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Option 1 (Preferred by Applicant):</strong> Two rows of soldier course brick and an aluminum drip cap at the top, with a precast concrete lintel over windows. A mural is proposed on the stair tower, integrated with the architecture.</li>
<li><strong>Option 2:</strong> A more distinct black aluminum cornice that steps with the massing, aligned to vertical upper massing pieces.</li>
<li><strong>Option 3:</strong> A continuous cornice across all upper massing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Board Comments:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Lynn Richards:</strong> Expressed strong support for the mural on the revival side and suggested extending it to the other large blank wall. Pablo Picker confirmed the intention to wrap the mural to the other side, integrating it with the existing tree. Richards preferred Option 1 for its subtlety and consistent articulation.</li>
<li><strong>Michael McNeely:</strong> Appreciated the design options and the applicant's responsiveness.<ul>
<li><strong>Unit Mix:</strong> Inquired about further consideration for increasing bedroom count or incorporating more accessibility features (Group 2 accessibility).<ul>
<li>Pablo Picker explained that the building's width and two staircases make three-bedroom units spatially challenging and inefficient (e.g., 2,700 sq ft for a three-bedroom). He noted the focus on generous two-bedroom units.</li>
<li>Paul Miller clarified that all units are Group 1 accessible, and Group 2 accessibility is typically triggered at 20 units. Modifying for Group 2 in a small building presents significant spatial and financial challenges (e.g., larger bathrooms, modifiable kitchens, plumbing transfers).</li>
<li>McNeely expressed disappointment about the lack of three-bedroom units but acknowledged the effort to provide two-bedroom units. He urged continued consideration for accessibility and diversity in future projects.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Underground Vault:</strong> Asked if further thought was given to the underground vault, given the water table.<ul>
<li>Applicant stated no issues were identified by engineers.</li>
<li>McNeely proposed a condition that if the transformer vault cannot be underground and materially impacts the project, it must return to the Board for review, ensuring it is not deemed a de minimis change. Staff confirmed this would trigger a plan revision.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Luc Schuster:</strong> Missed the previous meeting but reviewed the video. Confirmed his ability to participate after submitting an affidavit.</li>
<li><strong>Chair Capuano:</strong><ul>
<li>Expressed a personal preference for Option 2 or 3, believing they offer more definition to the building's top, but acknowledged the applicant's preference for Option 1.</li>
<li>Clarified that the Board frequently discusses design elements.</li>
<li>Acknowledged the applicant's commitment to quality and working with the Board.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Action:</strong><ul>

<h3 id="6-74-middlesex-avenue-public-hearing">6. 74 Middlesex Avenue (Public Hearing)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Resolution/Ordinance/Code:</strong> ZP25-000076, SCO 7.4.9.B (Special Permit for nonconforming wall signs)</li>
<li><strong>Applicant:</strong> 74M Property Owner LLC (represented by Charles Spivey, Darren Baird, Anthony Galluccio)</li>
<li><strong>Notice of Public Hearing Read into Record:</strong> "Seventy-four, Middlesex Avenue, 74M property owner LLC seeks to install nonconforming wall signs in the Assembly Square Mixed Use District, ASMD, per SCO 7.4.9.B, which requires a special permit, ZP25-000076."</li>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Applicant Presentation:</strong><ul>
<li>Charles Spivey (Graystar Asset Management) and Darren Baird (Attorney) explained the request for a special permit for three property identification signs ("74M" in a circle) located above entry doors on the north, south, and west sides of the 15-story, 525,000 sq ft lab/office building.</li>
<li>The signs are already installed. The applicant initially considered them wayfinding, not technical signage, but ISD flagged them as requiring relief.</li>
<li><strong>Non-conformities:</strong><ul>
<li>Wall signs are for address identification, not ground-story businesses (Article 10.8).</li>
<li>Adhered to glass curtain wall, not permitted for architectural elements.</li>
<li>Provide property information, not business name/logo.</li>
<li>Located at three entrances; typically one wall sign per tenant (unless corner tenant, then two).</li>
<li>Diameter of the circle is 5 feet, exceeding the 4-foot maximum height for wall signs under 10.8.11a.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Staff Comments (Steve Carey, Case Planner):</strong><ul>
<li>Confirmed the applicant's understanding that the signs were wayfinding, not requiring relief, until ISD flagged them.</li>
<li>Staff's recommendation is to reduce the sign diameter from 5 feet to 4 feet to bring it closer to compliance.</li>
<li>Clarified that this is not a de minimis change because it requires a discretionary approval, despite its small scope.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Public Testimony (in support):</strong> None.</li>
<li><strong>Public Testimony (in opposition/concern):</strong> None.</li>
<li><strong>Board Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Luc Schuster:</strong> Noted the signs are already installed and questioned if reducing the size to 4 feet was necessary given the minor difference.</li>
<li><strong>Applicant Response (Anthony Galluccio):</strong> Explained that the hardware for backlighting the sign is the same diameter as the existing 5-foot circle, making reduction challenging without significant rework. Argued the 5-foot size is appropriate for wayfinding and distinguishing the building.</li>
<li><strong>Chair Capuano:</strong> Initially concerned about "forgiveness instead of permission," but found the 5-foot vs. 4-foot difference "silly" and believed a smaller sign would look "weird" on the window. Supported allowing the existing 5-foot sign.</li>
<li><strong>Lynn Richards:</strong> Agreed with Chair Capuano, noting that lab buildings are underutilized and supporting the applicant in getting tenants rather than "fussing with signs."</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Action:</strong> The Chair moved to approve the special permit for nonconforming wall signs, as modified to allow the 5-foot diameter circle, contrary to the staff memorandum's recommendation of 4 feet.</li>
<li><strong>Vote:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Motion by:</strong> Chair Capuano</li>
<li><strong>Seconded by:</strong> Jahan Habib</li>
<li><strong>Roll Call Vote:</strong><ul>
<li>Jahan Habib: Aye</li>
<li>Michael McNeely: Aye</li>
<li>Lynn Richards: Aye</li>
<li>Luc Schuster: Aye</li>

</li>
<li><strong>Applicant:</strong> 675 Somerville LLC (represented by Attorney Adam Dash, Alexander Varelis, Sylvia Sheldahl &amp; Paxton Sheldahl from BOS Urban Architecture, Christian Ammonia from Offshoots, Krista Lucas from Howard Stein Hudson)</li>
<li><strong>Notice of Public Hearing Read into Record:</strong> "3 Craigie Street, 675 Somerville Avenue, 675 Somerville LLC seeks to develop a general building in the MR3 zoning district which requires a site plan approval ZP25-000016. 675 Somerville LLC seeks to establish a residential house use in the MR3 zoning district which requires a special permit ZP25-000017."</li>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Applicant Presentation (Attorney Adam Dash, Sylvia Sheldahl, Christian Ammonia, Krista Lucas):</strong><ul>
<li>Proposed redevelopment of an existing gas station and auto body shop into a three-story, 14-unit, all-electric mixed-use building with ground-floor commercial space.</li>
<li>No car parking proposed or required; transit-oriented development.</li>
<li><strong>Unit Mix:</strong> 14 rental units (5 one-bedroom, 7 two-bedroom, 2 studios), with 2 units designated as affordable (specific mix to be determined with Housing Division).</li>
<li><strong>Sustainability:</strong> Green score compliance, removal of automotive use, increased pedestrian safety by infilling curb cuts, HERS certification, pollinator-safe planting.</li>
<li><strong>Site Features:</strong> Main residential access on Craigie Street, commercial access on Somerville Ave, secondary residential pedestrian access. Transformer location screened and open-air.</li>
<li><strong>Trash Management:</strong> Trash room inside the building (near bike parking) for 80-gallon rolling bins, to be wheeled to Somerville Ave on trash day. Recycling bins in a screened, covered area at the back, with consideration for rat-proof enclosures (e.g., Citibin).</li>
<li><strong>Transportation (Krista Lucas):</strong> Three curb cuts to be closed (one on Craigie, two on Somerville Ave). Bike room for 14 residents, 6 visitor spaces (2 covered racks in courtyard, 1 rack on Somerville Ave). Exceeds minimum bike parking requirements.</li>
<li><strong>Design:</strong> Glazed corner for visibility, open common space with planting and lighting, private outdoor amenities for ground-floor units. Fencing along property line to secure site while maintaining easement for abutter's fire escape.</li>
<li><strong>Massing &amp; Facade:</strong> Two-block massing for light/air, recessed residential entry, continuous commercial space. Face brick (full brick, not thin veneer) in copper tone with jade and coral fiber cement panel accents. Triple-pane glazing in bedrooms for sound attenuation (car wash, MBTA commuter rail).</li>
<li><strong>Landscape (Christian Ammonia):</strong> Courtyard with cafe-style seating, catenary lighting, planting. Permeable unit pavers and P-stone paving for water infiltration. Pollinator-friendly native plants, deep-rooted trees for pollutant trapping. Green roof with sedum cuttings and native plug plantings.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Board Questions/Comments during Presentation:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Lynn Richards:</strong> Inquired about the removal of underground storage tanks (USTs) from the former gas station.<ul>
<li><strong>Applicant Response (Alex Varelis):</strong> USTs were removed in 2018 with an LSP on site; soil samples were clean. A report is available.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Public Testimony (in support):</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Crystal Hough (Ward 5):</strong> Supported the project, praising the removal of the parking lot, the amount of housing, native plantings, and soundproofing. Suggested making at least one accessible unit affordable and consulting on adaptive bike parking for wheelchair users.</li>
<li><strong>Lisa Bedford (1012 Ibbotson):</strong> Abutter, loved the design, appreciated the incorporation of neighborhood comments, and believed it would be a great upgrade.</li>
<li><strong>Aaron Webber (32 Summit Avenue):</strong> Supported the project as a transit-oriented, low-parking, modest-sized development from a local family, aligning with city goals for redevelopment from automotive to housing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Public Testimony (in opposition/concern):</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Kenneth Leitner (representing abutters at 669 Somerville Avenue):</strong> Expressed concerns on behalf of abutters to the east.<ul>
<li><strong>Impact on Abutters:</strong> Loss of light and airflow due to new building.</li>
<li><strong>Trash Location:</strong> Objected to trash and recycling being located closest to their building, arguing it would bear the burden of trash from 14 units and commercial spaces. Suggested reconfiguring for Craigie Street.</li>
<li><strong>Snow Removal:</strong> No plan for snow removal or water prevention against abutter's building.</li>
<li><strong>Traffic/Deliveries:</strong> Concerns about increased traffic, bicycles, and potential deliveries for commercial units in the alleyway.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Board Discussion (after Public Testimony):</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Lynn Richards:</strong><ul>
<li>Questioned the landscape architect's choice of pollutant-soaking plants if the soil was clean.<ul>
<li><strong>Christian Ammonia:</strong> Explained it's a proactive firm-wide practice for urban environments, addressing potential pollutants from abutting properties, air particulate matter, and groundwater, ensuring long-term ecological benefit.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Asked about managing runoff from impervious cover.<ul>
<li><strong>Christian Ammonia:</strong> Confirmed permeable pavers and P-stone paving are used in the courtyard and planting areas for water infiltration.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Raised concerns about ride-share pickup/drop-off and potential double parking, especially with the bike lane.<ul>
<li><strong>Applicant (Adam Dash/Krista Lucas):</strong> Mobility Division designated some meters (8 AM-noon) for loading/pickup/drop-off. Additional residential permit parking on Craigie Street. Acknowledged Ubers/Lyfts might drop off anywhere but hoped for Craigie Street use.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Chair Capuano:</strong><ul>
<li>Asked for clarification on trash handling, particularly in the alleyway.<ul>
<li><strong>Applicant (Paxton Sheldahl/Sylvia Sheldahl):</strong> Trash is inside the building, wheeled out to Somerville Ave on trash day. Recycling is in a screened, covered area at the back, with robust, rat-proof enclosures being considered.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Inquired about commercial space tenants.<ul>
<li><strong>Applicant (Alex Varelis):</strong> No tenant secured yet; building will be built first, then tenants sought. Not expecting a cafe due to nearby options.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Asked about the "face brick" material, referencing past issues with "fake brick."<ul>
<li><strong>Applicant (Paxton Sheldahl/Alex Varelis):</strong> Confirmed it is full brick, not thin veneer, chosen for longevity and low maintenance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Michael McNeely:</strong><ul>
<li>Reiterated concerns about unit mix diversity, specifically the lack of three-bedroom units.</li>
<li>Pushed for accessible units to also be designated affordable.<ul>
<li><strong>Applicant (Adam Dash/Paxton Sheldahl):</strong> Affordability discussions occur with the Housing Division post-approval. Explained that the MR3 zoning and walk-up design (no elevator) are chosen to keep costs down and make units more affordable. Acknowledged the two-bedroom mix was chosen to cater to smaller households, aligning with "general building" typology in Somerville zoning.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Expressed disappointment that the project isn't pushing further on diversity or affordability, given the cost-saving measures.</li>
<li>Reiterated concerns about trash, emphasizing the need for rat-proof solutions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Luc Schuster:</strong> Appreciated the thought-through details. Echoed concerns about unit mix. Noted that train noise is quickly adapted to. Praised the project's potential to add vibrancy and a neighborhood feel to the Somerville Ave stretch.</li>
<li><strong>Jahan Habib:</strong> Inquired about the building's energy source and conservation efforts.<ul>
<li><strong>Applicant (Paxton Sheldahl):</strong> Confirmed it's an all-electric building, as required by energy code. Highlighted passive strategies like cross-ventilation (due to walk-up typology) and shaded balconies for energy efficiency.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Action:</strong> The Chair moved to continue the agenda item to the next meeting (September 4, 2025). The written comment period will remain open until Friday, August 29, 2025, at 9:00 AM.</li>
