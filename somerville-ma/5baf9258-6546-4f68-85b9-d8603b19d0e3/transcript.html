Scott, Ward 2 Counselor and Vice Chair of the Committee, serving as Chair tonight, at least for the start of the meeting, as Chair Wilson is at one of his children&#39;s graduations tonight, and will be joining us anticipated sometime shortly after 7.00. As we get started, I&#39;ll let you know that pursuant to Chapter 2 of the Acts of 2025, this meeting is being conducted via remote participation. And audio and video recordings will be posted as soon as possible after the meeting on the city website and local cable access channels. Given that, let&#39;s go ahead and get the meeting started with a roll call to establish a quorum. If you don&#39;t mind, Clerk Forsalese. This is roll call.</td>

The only change I anticipate for this meeting is that we&#39;ll be sliding the police animal control and E911 to the end of the evening. means we&#39;re going to start off with the executive administration emergency management and then fire and then move on to parking water and sewer iam capital projects and then the dpw departments so with that said we do have our collection of answers, departmental memos in response to counselor questions that were submitted in advance. Those are available not just attached to the memo or attached to the agenda, but they&#39;re also available on the City of Somerville&#39;s FY26 budget book under the second tab on the page. So as we go through these departments, we will be just pulling up those memos so that everybody can take a look at it. Hopefully, colleagues have been able to review that ahead of time, although they did come out pretty late today, I think. So we&#39;ll be pulling those up and just inviting folks to ask questions as we get through the departments, just like our last night. So with that said, are there any announcements or concerns from the administration before we get going?</td>

I will just note it because it is a higher percentage of positions than I think are in many other departments. But my question pertains to my first question. Sorry. As I mentioned, I was eating Takis. They really get me. But as I was saying, my first question pertains to dues and memberships. The office spends nearly $50,000 a year on dues and memberships. Can the chief of staff provide discounts over the list of the organizations that these fees are paid to?</td>

Some have dues and memberships, but I think it&#39;s safe to say that the Executive Administration Office has the largest line item of this sort, at least that I&#39;ve noticed thus far. So just curious to have a breakdown there. Happy to be corrected on that point as well. Moving on to another point, the summer youth program. First of all, love that it&#39;s in the line item as that. I&#39;ve been a long critic of calling it the mayor&#39;s youth jobs program, just because the council confirms all allocations and including in this process in the budget, nothing is any more finances of the mayor than the council, frankly. But I did notice that about more than a third of that funding has yet to be spent for this fiscal year. Are we expecting to see a significant increase in expenditures before the fiscal year is up?</td>

                <td> through you mr chair to councillor burnley thank you for the question um yes that&#39;s a that&#39;s a very good question um so we have budgeted for this fiscal year in the past several years four hundred and seventy thousand dollars to date we&#39;ve spent about three hundred thousand dollars when i checked in with our youth services division and our own team because we do work together on this finance line um they&#39;re anticipating about forty four thousand dollars so we will have certainly a remainder that&#39;s quite hefty. We&#39;ve noticed that for the last few years. The challenge here is that we do budget. We&#39;ve been trying to get closer and closer to the correct number. We budget for a certain number of students and of course students don&#39;t come every day or their summer plans change and so we&#39;re trying to build in more flexibility. Some important things to note this year is that you know we update the living wage every year and so that also is an increase every year for our student jobs. In addition, this year, we have spent more than we have ever spent on this program before as of today, not even by the end of June. And that&#39;s because, A, we&#39;re increasing the number of students, but also we have increased the number of roles and jobs available during the school year. So in partnership with the services division, this mayor summer jobs program is not just summer anymore. And so this was piloted during this academic school year. I also want to shout out DPW. They&#39;ve been doing some great things during the school year as well with their let&#39;s get working program. And so, yeah, I understand and share your concern that there&#39;s an underspent amount. i have reduced this by 40k this year and i know that counselor wilson submitted a question on this line that reduction should not impact the program i think that we&#39;ll still have ample um both for the reasons that we just discussed that we&#39;ve been under spending but also because i think we&#39;ll have some wiggle room during the school year to really be able to expand and grow the number of student jobs that we have during the school year so we&#39;re trying to spread those opportunities throughout</td>

                <td> Firstly, thank you for that very thorough response. You know, it answered some of my immediate follow-ups to that question. I&#39;ll just note for folks who went to art school like I did but do not have, you know, great response to arithmetic like I somehow do, that that decrease of 44,000 still, you know, leaves, you know, Again, almost a third of what was budgeted for this year would have been underspent if it was down 44. It would be about 100,000, just under 100,000 unspent if that had been the case this year based on what was spent. I want to acknowledge, of course, that when we&#39;re talking about students, when we&#39;re talking about our children and offering these opportunities, It&#39;s not necessarily the easiest thing to do in the world to hire young folks. As we know, as a local government, it&#39;s not the easiest thing in the world to hire people in general. So I want to acknowledge that. I am curious, based on your response, though, is the administration planning to expand this pilot or not? making the summer jobs program more of a jobs program in general for the youth jobs program moving into FY26.</td>

So we&#39;ve had conversations with the Youth Services Division, and I believe that the city council may be aware that there was a youth services needs assessment. And one of the recommendations was to expand employment throughout the school year. We&#39;re also, you know, throughout the summer, we&#39;ve had intense interest in this program. We want to be able to spread the opportunities to more students. And so we think that there are ways to do that throughout the school year as well. And so, yes, we do plan on expanding and look forward to working with HHS and the services division, schools, different city departments. I believe this year they had folks across eight city departments during the school year, but we can certainly get more information about that if you&#39;re curious.</td>

                <td> Good afternoon. Through the chair to counselor. So goal three actually goes very pairs very well with actually goal for to answer a little bit of your of your question. What we&#39;re doing in goal goal three first and foremost is that we are going to be putting together an actual steering committee. that takes part of different departments. As we define that objective clearly, we&#39;re going to be tracking on what we need to modernize in terms of internal systems or just efficiencies and service delivery. This is both for internal staff, but then also how that affects the external staff as well. So with that goal three, the idea here is to set some smart goals in place for internal not only technology modernization, but also for, say, whether it&#39;s vehicle inventory and then software audit. In part of that software audit, I think that&#39;s what&#39;s possibly going to be able to answer your, the answer to your question is probably more focused on the software audit part of it, whereas we actually take an inventory of the different type of software that each department is using. It&#39;s really getting a sense that only have a cost effective approach of the city in terms of, is there one department that is using a curtain software that perhaps another two or three other departments are also using that perhaps are able to collaborate and get a, what I call an umbrella license. So that way we&#39;re able to have a cost savings approach on that end. But also the other caveat to the software inventory is not only as our staff how are they able to use it but how does that software echo into the external community right is there a software that we&#39;re currently using that to your point you know maybe someone who is I&#39;d say has some sort of disability where they are deaf, they&#39;re blind, they have an audio disability. How are we able to provide that to them? Same thing, whether even for vendors. It goes in place with the vendor self-service application that we, as you may know, came before the council last year. That was an implementation period. This year, we&#39;ve actually kicked that off. And so we are actually getting feedback as well from the different vendors, nonprofit organizations, corporations, just stakeholders in the city. And that feedback is going to be extremely important for us, which we&#39;ve actually already started to receive. whether it&#39;s language access, right? How do we add, whether it&#39;s like a Google Translate, how do we work maybe with a Summer Viva and other departments? That&#39;s all going to come out of the software inventory, which is a little bit part of Goal 4, and it&#39;s going to tackle into a little bit of Goal 4 in the intranet part of it, which... I&#39;m working collaboratively as well with a digital innovative officer so that we can make sure that all that information that we&#39;re also collecting, not only are we actually tracking it, but once it&#39;s done, whether we create policies out of it or so forth, it actually has a storage within our own internal staff, an access tool that they can actually go to without trying to figure out where it is within our, say, our hard drive. So that&#39;s more of a storage place that we would be putting the inventory. I&#39;m happy to follow up months ahead and give you any updates on how we&#39;re doing as a city with that. But I seem to think that this is really going to be helpful, not only internally, but externally as well.</td>

There is a lot of outreach to different youth and through community partners, including the Mystic Learning Center, to ensure that folks are aware of this program. Our Youth Services Division holds orientations for youth who are applying because we know that that can be a barrier. And we&#39;re really closely with HR to help folks get through that. So it is a gigantic team effort. We rely on many of the partners that we rely on to do any outreach to our families and our youth. and have a really robust system of trying to get folks through the door. So thank you for the question. It&#39;s one that the team has spent a lot of work on and intentionally building the capacity to make sure that we&#39;re meeting our most vulnerable youth. And that being said, as we mentioned this before, that doesn&#39;t stop over the summer. And I think that they&#39;re thinking forward to what they can do in the academic year in that area as well.</td>

                <td> Through the chair to Councillor Clingan, that&#39;s an excellent question. And I know we talked about this a little bit last year as well. The public safety for all project manager position is a temporary one. So it&#39;s funded not necessarily on the general fund budget in the mayor&#39;s office, but it rolls up under the mayor&#39;s office and does partner very closely with the racial and social justice team. This position is meant to pull us all together across the city. The Public Safety for All reports, the three reports that came out late January, early February, have over 70 recommendations. By implementing these different recommendations, will require work across many, many departments from public safety departments to RSJ to HR and law. RSJ, for instance, is an expert in the public process and the equity goals that came out in these recommendations. For very understandable reasons, they are not experts in say bargaining or any of the other technical work that we&#39;re hoping that this person can help us create a work plan around and hurt us all across the city to make sure that we&#39;re coordinated in adopting these. Given the extensive nature, of the recommendations and the complex project management work that does need to come out of it. We felt that it was best that it sit underneath the mayor&#39;s office, particularly because they will be going through the recommendations and making recommendations to us about how best to fund or implement. And those will all be executive decisions.</td>

So, you know, it was kind of brought together, not based on, you know, my wishes or the emergency department, but on, you know, best practice and what they thought we would need. Being in a position where evaluating, you know, what the city&#39;s needs are and how we can meet those emergency management and funding, we still didn&#39;t want to spend money that we didn&#39;t need to spend. So we tried to make sure we were responsible with the funds, spent it where we needed to spend, and work to identify a more in-line budget for fiscal 26.</td>

It&#39;s day by day on these things. But given the lack of emergency management support that we can expect as our federal government continues to decay, it would seem to me that having a robust capacity locally might be something we wanted to invest in. I&#39;m kind of curious as to what your view is on that and whether or not we can anticipate an expanded OM or PS line in this department in the future as you look towards how this department is going to develop.</td>

And I think you kind of answered my question with some of your statement and the fact that, you know, we would be doing this anyways. We&#39;re trying to build up resiliency within the city of Somerville and we&#39;re taking a whole community approach. And that means involving not just city departments, but. residents, businesses, and all aspects, you know, volunteer groups, that sort of thing, in the resiliency and the emergency management partnership. And that&#39;s why when you look at some of the goals for next year, we&#39;re looking at, you know, doing some business continuity planning so we can make sure that if something does happen, we can mitigate some of the effects to make sure that people are getting the critical needs they need, the critical infrastructure that people depend on within the city, as well as economic impacts of a business being impacted. And then working with the city to make sure that the continuity is there for any city departments and the services that people come to expect if they&#39;re impacted in any way, try to mitigate that impact in that way. Also, as one of the other goals, I think it was my goal three, was I think we need to, we&#39;re at a point now in this process of emergency management, we need to have, you know, start working towards actually doing that whole community approach. We need to start working with the community. You know, this is, when it comes to emergency management, it&#39;s not something we project to the community, but the community is actually an active partner. We want to make sure that we&#39;re working with the community, and that can be, again, all aspects. That can be, you know, anyone from residents, renters, unhoused, you know, anyone that makes up the community as well as businesses so that we can work together to first of all identify what the needs are, identify some of the hazards and how they impact specific people because not everyone&#39;s impacted the same way by a disaster or an incident and then make sure we can try to mitigate and assist perfectly or as best we can through planning and collaboration to meet those needs. So going back to your question, Stan, more specifically, I think that we have to plan on the fact that we have to be as resilient as a community as we can and not depend on outside assistance and just hope that if we do need it, there is some assistance there. But I think right now we can&#39;t depend on it. So that&#39;s how we&#39;re operating and trying to build up that resiliency.</td>

                <td> Yeah, thank you, Mr. Chair, through you to the director. So this is one of those ones where, I mean, certainly your department is one of those where I&#39;ve sort of struggled with in the sense that, like, you know, what are people&#39;s expectations? Like, what are the citizens&#39; essential expectations? Because, you know, there&#39;s such a sliding scale of, like, potential emergencies. One of the things that I continue to â and it looks like on goal number â Two, FY26 goals and measures develop, finalize, and begin implementation of a comprehensive city and business continuity operation plan. So the reason why I bring that up is because the school committee in our joint meetings continues to ask for... the potential for like if a building goes offline like the winter hill did you know like somebody needs to be thinking about these things and like director race is like up to his eyeballs and work and stuff like that and you know i don&#39;t i don&#39;t know how deep you all can go on on like plans or ideas you know like what&#39;s available tomorrow might not be available next week you know like the archdiocese like saint anne&#39;s school or something may not be there But is this something, because like I said, in terms of just outlining what it is you all are there to do and what people might expect might be two different things. I see your goals here, but I&#39;m just curious if there&#39;s been any talk of like, since an ordinance didn&#39;t create your department where it could be outlined pretty in black and white, how do you all see the scope of work that you&#39;re being asked to do?</td>

                <td> So through the chair, Councilor Clingan, so specifically your initial question, the school departments, we do interact with them regularly, but they have their own emergency management or at least that type of emergency preparedness personnel that deal with school incident action plans and that sort of thing. So they handle those internal plans. When it comes to how I see the department and how the community should see my department, I think that I obviously have my ideas of what emergency management should look like, but also am open to, which is one of the reasons why we want to partner with the community, because I want to know more about what specifically the city of Somerville sees for the needs of this department when it comes to emergency management, meaning specifically how am I going to meet their needs and how, you know, Laura and I in the city are going to meet their needs in our emergency management model. Now, having said that, we look at it through a comprehensive, holistic approach. In other words, we look at it from a planning aspect. We look at it as collaboration. One of the things we did this year was we established the Somerville Emergency Management Group, which is a coalition of several departments that come together and meet regularly to do all aspects of emergency management. Because even when we have a disaster, the one thing we need to do is work together really well. And I will say that since I&#39;ve come here, that is really one of the things that Somerville achieves at. They really achieve very well at no matter what the situation is, coming together and working together to try to solve and work on issues. You know, bringing that group together and looking at ways we can train together to make sure that we have the training we need and looking at mitigation efforts. You know, there&#39;s all kinds of different aspects that I look at with emergency management. But again, when you say, you know, what does the community expect from it? I think we could probably do a better job, at least, you know. Being newer to the position and spending that first year kind of getting my feet wet and learning how the city works and making connections, I think it&#39;s time that we do get out in the community and start making those connections and, one, show the good work that emergency management can do and how it&#39;s going to affect their lives, but also listen and see how we can better reach them and assist them in a disaster because not everyone comes to a disaster from the same place.</td>

But all right, thank you very much, I appreciate your work and look forward to as you said, as you kind of. get out into the Community and get in and kind of fine tune what it is, because you know we in several we have this. habit or whatever you want to call it of calling things like a public health emergency. You know, racism, the public health emergency, these type of things. So, you know, again, I don&#39;t this is taxpayer money. The folks are paying for this department.

                <td>Thank you for that question, Councilman Ba. I really appreciate that question because we&#39;ve put a lot of work into that area. As you know, we had the warming center at the Cummings School last year. We had the operation. I thought it was fairly successful. We learned a lot from previous years and we put a lot of things in place, but there&#39;s always room for improvements. And one of the things we do with any event, incident, or project that we do, especially at that largest scale, is when it gets towards the end, we launch a comprehensive after action review. So how do we do that? So we went in and we gave surveys, health and human services, crisis counselors, went in and assisted along with the contractor housing family staff and the residents that were utilizing the shelter filled out surveys. And they were created through assistance of summer stat to get to the point of some of that data we&#39;re looking for. And basically it was, what was your experience in the warming center? How did it benefit you? And what other ways could we, you know, improve upon it and benefit you more moving forward? We also did surveys for all the staff that worked there, whether it was city staff or contract staff, filled out surveys also to get their experiences and ways that they thought, you know, things went well or things could be improved upon or ways we could better impact the residents that were, you know, trying to serve there. We also put out community surveys around the area of the warming center, looking for the communities and how they were impacted by the warming center in their community and what they felt about the operations being at that site and what their interactions were having open there. In addition to that, we hosted a community open and listening session so that we, myself, emergency management, Lauren, deputy director, as well as somebody from the housing coalition and the HHS just went in and we said, listen, we want to hear, we want to hear from you. I want to hear what your experiences were. And we spent a couple hours just interacting with folks, listening to what their experiences were. And so we tried to make sure we tried to reach as many people as we could. We tried to capture that data in a comprehensive way. And now we are currently finishing an after action report, a detailed after action report with all that information as well as other data points that were captured throughout the year. through our daily reports, our monthly interactions through the department heads on things that worked well, things that could be improved upon, so that hopefully when this is all said and done, we have a good picture of how we can make sure that we enhance the things that worked well, we have the best site, and that we can identify those things that maybe did not work as well and put in place those process improvements. I think we did a pretty comprehensive job on this and I really am proud of the work we did in this area.</td>

                <td>Thank you. Through the Chair, I&#39;m going to pick it up right where Councilman Ba left off. I&#39;ll start similarly to him by just commending you on this framework that you&#39;re operating in. I think Perhaps it was last budget cycle or right after you were hired. I don&#39;t remember if it was during the budget cycle before. But I remember specifically talking to you about the importance of a broad definition of what an emergency is. I&#39;ve been lucky enough to not have to come across many emergencies in my time as a counselor. but to have also been on the scene when someone&#39;s house is on fire, to have personally experienced displacements, to know as a lived reality that racism is a public health crisis, which is, of course, entirely in line with any research about social determinants of health. People experience different events as crises of the highest order. And I know that there are legal definitions and frameworks around how you can use certain funds, especially UASI funds, which can be used, for example, to teach bystanders how to give first aid help before emergency response can respond. But I just want to just note that I do think it&#39;s very important that we have this very flexible definition because there are so many incidents that we can&#39;t even necessarily fully foresee or things that we may foresee that may have a larger impact on some people than others. Now, getting that out the way, Councilor Mbah poked on something that I&#39;m curious about. You mentioned it in this after action report. When do you expect for that to be seen by the council?</td>

And I actually appreciate the buildup to the question because I completely embrace everything you said. I touched for a second about one of the statements you said that I wanted to just clarify because I think you&#39;re very much on point in the fact that how do I define an emergency? I know myself whenever I&#39;m evaluating something, I look at how is it impacting the community? I don&#39;t care what it is. I don&#39;t care if it&#39;s a flood, a fire, a tornado, whatever it is. My focus is how is it affecting the community and do they need assistance because of it? It doesn&#39;t matter how we define it. But that&#39;s how I define it, the impact to the community. Going back to the original question, oh God, I&#39;m losing my mind. What was the original question?</td>

And so I could say probably within the next couple of weeks, it&#39;ll be completed. And then we go through some reviews. I like all these things, whether it&#39;s our plans. or it&#39;s these type of things. I like to have them review with some departments such as law, but also I want them, everything we do is going to go through racial and social justice. It&#39;s going to go through, you know, ADA, you know, because I want to make sure that they have their input in it. It&#39;s, you know, when I work in emergency management, it&#39;s not, you know, some of these things are not things that we check for boxes. These are encompass everything we do. So I would say probably you guys would see it. It&#39;s a rough estimate, probably within the next month.</td>

                <td> Well, thank you. I think that&#39;s really impressive. Councilor Scott has been here in these budget meetings longer than I have. I will say during my tenure, we don&#39;t typically get timelines that are one that defined, but certainly not that quick. And I&#39;m happy if that turns out to be the case, if it takes you a few more weeks, I think that&#39;s reasonable given the amount of departments that may have to review. Having said that, the reason I ask is because I think you brought up a lot of really important points about, especially the warming center. Before it was implemented, when it was announced, I know that there was a number of folks in the community who had certain concerns about the placement of the warming center. I understand why the city put it there, especially given the previous warming center, which was before your tenure, but which was in the armory. There were some issues there as well. But I&#39;m very curious and interested to hear how it actually felt for the neighborhood, for the folks who were involved, to get that out to not just us as counselors, but to the public so that we can build upon this model because it is clear to everybody that we need warming centers. In my opinion, this is not a, do we do it or do we not do it situation? This is, we absolutely need to do this. It is an imperative public health issue and public safety issue, but we also have responsibility to do it well and responsibly. So I&#39;m looking forward to that document and, you know, I&#39;m sure the Council will follow up with any questions based on what we. Thank you.</td>

So again, this is just about managing expectations. And like, so the folks at home, you know, because we could get in a situation where there&#39;s an expectation, and then things don&#39;t go a certain way. So I was just illustrating that there are all types of, of, of emergencies, like was said, like, uh, racial equities as well as, um, the opiate crisis, uh, and many others. And that&#39;s all I&#39;m saying is if that&#39;s what the, if we, I think we need to define the scope, um, of, of what our expectations are for this particular thing.

I was also going to ask about the overtime in particular. you know, I&#39;m but a simple, small city, city councilor. And so maybe it&#39;s above my understanding, but, you know, typically when, and I understand we&#39;re opening a whole new station, but, you know, typically when we hire more people, overtime comes down. This is a significant increase in overtime, which, you know, historically has also often been over budget. So I, I will just note some concern there that I think the chair touched on very adequately. I would just add, because it is hundreds of thousands of dollars, but moving beyond the overtime budget, I&#39;m curious about the professional and technical services line. The chief to you, are you expecting any impacts due to a reduction of that line in this fiscal year?</td>

I try to say as many times as possible, whenever the department is before me, that I&#39;m incredibly grateful for the work that the fire department does, whether it is responding to fires themselves or whether it is offering services to members of the public who are in crisis. Because I know you do a wide range of work, including, and I remember talking to someone in the department who was rank and file a year ago, uh, when someone in the mystics got locked out of their apartment and they just like, they climbed up through the window, let them in, you know, that kind of stuff you&#39;re not going to get from every department. Uh, and I just thankful for the work on that. Um, but more on the, the service level, um, or the level of service. Uh, I, I&#39;m really grateful also that in your department, you all can included, um, essentially call accidents per fiscal year and the rates there. And I do want to just note that it seems like FY25 had lower calls for service than in previous years. Chief, do you want to speak to that at all and how that may impact the budget for FY26 or?</td>

Sometimes, you know, I wish I can say that for other departments, but, you know, yesterday, I think, no, two days ago, I was on Rogers Ave, you know, just to, you know, check on a friend and then did somebody say oh well there was like your friend down the street there had like a little fire I was like what and then I went out you know to go go check on the friend what happened how was the responsiveness they were like in less than no time I was like wow yeah all I was just so yeah uh thank you to you and your your team your department for just being swift in responding. I guess one, I just wanna make sure that I&#39;m clear about this. So the cost of the listing and operation of the new fire station at assembly are now incorporated into your budget line item, correct? Yes, that&#39;s correct. Okay, thanks. I wanted to clarify that. And one last clarifying question is just about how, I think we&#39;ve talked, we&#39;ve chatted about this, but just like on and off, like just... outside of this formal platform, but like, how do you incorporate like saying, you know, like language access and cultural competency, you know, like into your own, like when I&#39;m talking about that, just like the non-English speaking residents, you know, into your response protocol, like an outreach, like how do you do that, you know?</td>

Looking forward to seeing Director Renfret tonight. Once again, the budget memo is available at the bottom of that page. see our clerk navigating the website. I invite you all to go to SomervilleMA.gov slash budget. You can spend some time just like the rest of us navigating our plans for this year. All right. Since we have that budget up, hopefully we&#39;re getting Director Renfret in front of the camera there.

I guess I&#39;m curious from the director&#39;s perspective, where do you think we&#39;re heading in terms of the funding there? Is the safety stakes going to ultimately be self-sustaining? Do you think they&#39;re going to bring in, are they already bringing in additional revenue? Is that going to have any impact anywhere else within the department?</td>

Last year, we budgeted more money because it was our first year going into the safety stick. So it was really an unknown. So we had to go by what other cities and towns were bringing in. So we kind of guessed at it, right? But now we have history, so we see how the safety sticks are going, and we feel that the amount we have budgeted should sustain us. And in a perfect world, to be honest with you, Counselor, it would be best if that was a zero, right? Because we want people to park legally.</td>

And it&#39;s, I think, also relevant to my next question, which is, you know, as we both know, the safety six are still in their infancy within Somerville. They&#39;re only in particular places, particularly Davis and Lagoon. Are we expecting that this budget is going to accommodate expansion of the program?</td>

So we want to stick to the safety and really help to enhance the Vision Zero initiative that mobility is pushing as well. So we&#39;re just working in collaboration with all the departments and the MBTA.

And you and I used to sit on many of these, the parking studies a few years ago, you know, the good old days, you know. I guess one of the things that I&#39;m curious about is that given the role of club space, in business activity? Like you see like there&#39;s deliveries and residents needs, like how is your department balancing like enforcement with equitable access, particularly like neighborhoods with limited off street parking or maybe say high density housing? Like, you know, they just, can you share some light about like your methodology, how you&#39;re handling stuff like that?</td>

                <td> So through the chair, we work closely with the other departments, mobility and engineering to regulate the curb. The parking department doesn&#39;t make the regulations for the curb. We don&#39;t dictate those. Those are dictated by the traffic commission. So we enforce whatever kind of regulation they want on that curb. We have rebranded all the loading zones in the city. Many of the loading zones, I should say, that with signs that I have pictures on them that say five minute passenger 20 minute commercial so that people will choose to park in these areas, a lot of times you see loading zone signs and other cities and towns that start with. toes on on the top and it&#39;s kind of scary so we&#39;ve rebranded them to make them look a little bit more inviting so people that maybe don&#39;t understand the language. they&#39;ll see that, hey, this looks like, you know, there&#39;s pictures here, I can park here. And they&#39;ll choose to park there rather than choose to park at a bus stop. So it&#39;s very dangerous when folks park at bus stops. So, you know, by adding this more clarity to the signs, we&#39;re hoping that folks will park in those areas. And when the mobility department redesign streets, they&#39;re always thinking about loading zones, accessible spots, Those are two major things that we learned from the parking study that we really wanted to put emphasis on. So as things change in the city, that&#39;s what we&#39;re gearing towards. Long-term parking should be on side streets or in lots. And we don&#39;t have a lot of lots in Somerville, but we do have underutilization in lots in the city.</td>

And while we&#39;re mentioning graduations, I will mention that my kindergarteners moving up ceremony this year was a real banger. All right. So for the Director of Parking, I guess I only had... Two quick ones, following up where Council Burnley left off there. I just wanted to extend my congratulations. You have an enormous number of positions. You&#39;re seeing a very large increase this year because of how many union positions you have. But the challenge of maintaining that staffing, with that many positions and that much turnover, it&#39;s always impressed me how you&#39;ve done, knocking it out of the park again this year. So hopefully it&#39;ll be a little bit less of a burden to manage the churn going forward. The only question I had for you here is that, you know, we did pass a homework petition and we&#39;re looking to get started with some automated enforcement on traffic signals in particular. Is that something that&#39;s been discussed with your department? I don&#39;t see any... budgeting in here for planning for that, is that something that&#39;s gonna end up in a different department or is that not something that&#39;s gotten to the point of planning and budgeting yet?</td>

                <td>Thank you, Mr. Chair. Just as a reminder to the general public who might be watching, this department is a little bit different in that the water and sewer expenses are paid out of the Water and Sewer Enterprise Fund, which is a separate fund from the general fund. It&#39;s directly funded by the water and sewer charges that we all pay. And as a result, there is no council action that can be taken particularly directly on that budget, except by the acceptance or rejection of the proposed water and sewer fees. We did have a conversation at council, I believe last week, regarding those water and sewer charges and a proposal from Director Raisha. Very thorough 82-page slideshow. As always, one of my favorites. So I believe I made my concerns clear that evening. We are executing all of our regular maintenance and emergency work in the water department using outside contractors, which costing the city approximately four times what we would do to operate those services by hand. And as we heard so eloquently from a working foreman in the department, maybe what we need isn&#39;t a director as much as we need more staffing in the department to actually get the work done at a more reasonable cost for tax. That said, I just wanted to recap that for folks that maybe weren&#39;t tuned into City Council that evening. I don&#39;t believe I have any further questions than the ones that I asked that night. All set.</td>

The tank itself is nearly complete, but we still have the pump station itself and the crossing of the McGrath, the very large pipe. So thus far, most things on that project are tracking within the budget. We had a few sort of normal items within our contingency. There was one item for which we&#39;re negotiating a cost. EPA changed the rules on PCB disposal for us in midstream. And so we&#39;ve incurred an unforeseen cost on that. We will be coming to the council shortly for a supplemental appropriation to cover that additional cost. And we&#39;re negotiating that number with the contractor right now. I expect to see y&#39;all probably in July for that overage.</td>

                <td> Thank you. Through the chair, two quick questions. Firstly, looking at the screen and looking at this budget book, am I the only one confused by the numbers I&#39;m seeing here? It seems like these are incorrect. Does anyone want to speak to that? I mean, the top line number says there&#39;s 100 percent difference between this fiscal year and the last. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s true. There&#39;s also just numbers in here that the spreadsheet just seems wildly off by my estimation, but perhaps I&#39;m just reading this wrong.</td>

I think it&#39;s always important for the council to know what they can and cannot do. Where we can do things, let&#39;s do it. Where we can&#39;t do things, let&#39;s make noise about it. And that&#39;s what I&#39;m doing. Just would love for the public to have some accurate numbers as they&#39;re looking at the budget, particularly for a department such as this, which has such incredible impact on daily life for our residents. I did have another question beyond just what am I looking at, but I will just admit that it did get kind of subsumed within the overall number confusion. Oh, there it was. I guess I&#39;m curious and I&#39;m trying not to preface this too much. I guess I&#39;m curious, through you, if the department has any sense of if changes to the rate structure will impact the overall cost for the department. Put another way, are we expecting that the expenditures will be relatively the same? Will they go up? Will they go down? Or are those numbers not related at all?</td>

A lot of the rate structure changes will be seen through our long-term capital improvement plan.

So we&#39;ve been able to, at this point in time, we have not funded Tuesday through Saturday positions, but we have funded, of course, all of the other positions Monday through Friday. Our emphasis will be on getting those filled. as soon as possible so that we can make the best impact on getting those boots on ground so that we can reduce some of the expenses that we&#39;ve been paying for the contractors to do their work on our behalf.</td>

But the other positions, there was an executive administrative assistant position that has not been funded. As well, there was a project, We had an internal promotion for a project manager, and we have decided not to backfill the engineering position that that person moved from, knowing that we have such great resources with our IAM staff and the engineers there.

First of all, we were at 94% of the water meters replaced as of that presentation to the full council last week. Hopefully, we&#39;d love to see that number tick up even more. Math question I had. You presented on Thursday night approximately 16,000 accounts and water meters in the city, 51,000 bills generated annually. That set off some mathematical red flags for me, just given all the talk of tri-annual billing we hear about, because $16,000 times three is $54,000. Then I remembered residential accounts are billed tri-annually, commercial accounts billed bi-annually. That&#39;s correct, right?</td>

Because there were so many moving parts, like I mentioned, the options.

And we also know anecdotally that generally the landlords pass those costs down to the renters as well. That families in those buildings have been paying more than their fair share of the overall revenue required by the water and sewer department. And so the rate restructure is really intended to shift that burden from those two and three family houses to the larger industrial users. So, you know, we see it as a big step forwards, you know, building equity or fairness that the council brought up, you know, income level. As we discussed, unfortunately, in the Massachusetts law, it is, the avenues explored for ratepayer assistance program within the enterprise fund is not permissible under mass law. You know, something that Councilor McLaughlin sort of bemoaned. We are continuing to look into other shapes and forms of, you know, sort of a needs-based subsidy program. So it&#39;s not what we had wanted to be coming forward with this year or the previous year, but it will continue to be something that we focus on to get to exactly your concern.</td>

I really appreciate, of course, the comprehensive memo But as always, I look at the OM spending. I know it&#39;s hard to figure out what the OM is appropriately going to be in each season, but it looks like we are surprisingly low on OM spend this year, even by usual standards. Traditionally, the five-year average is a little under 50% spend down there. Looks like we&#39;re just a touch over 20% so far. Where do you expect to end up on that this year? And what is it that hasn&#39;t gotten to?</td>

We had budgeted $350,000 for FY25 with the expectation that we would have procured a CMMS software and have implementation services to support that. The CMMS software was budgeted at $200,000 for this year, and support was $150,000. Due to some project constraints and limitations in our schedule, we&#39;re behind schedule now. We&#39;re currently under evaluation for that service. So of that $350,000, we&#39;ve only encumbered roughly $90,000 or $92,000 in our P&amp;T line for that initial design work. So we have not been able to encumber that full amount, and we do not expect to be able to encumber that amount by the end of the fiscal year.</td>

Even if IAM isn&#39;t the department that moves into it, we will be the department that facilitates that move, including the build out of the space. So we figured that someone was going to have to hold on to a photocopier expense, a water cooler expense moving, uh, office furniture, which is actually more like cubicles than like, you know, chairs. Um, so we just sort of held that 1895 move budget in IAM&#39;s budget, uh, knowing that someone in the city was going to spend it.

Another nitpicky question I have. Where was it? Yeah, I asked someone earlier, a different department, about dues and memberships. And I did notice that the actuals for the budget for the dues and memberships this year, quite beyond what we&#39;re about, I should say, is about 50% over budgeted, over the budget in FY25.

Been looking at like just the level of stuff that he&#39;s doing and I&#39;m reading all these goals and aspirations. In light of the increase in out-of-state travel and staff development, I&#39;m wondering what steps are being taken to ensure that this professional learning investment ultimately will benefit frontline communities that are facing the greatest infrastructure challenges in the city, like flooding, air quality, street safety.</td>

                <td> Through the chair, thank you for that question and the opportunity to highlight this. There&#39;s two aspects of the professional development in the conferences and the dues and the professional associations that we offer our staff that have a benefit for the city. And it is, I think, twofold. One, unlike a lot of other departments, I am particularly engineering and capital projects, Our competition for staff isn&#39;t just other cities and towns. We also are in competition for that staff against consulting firms who pay, frankly, considerably more than we do. But what we&#39;re able to offer our staff that is a lot more constrained in the private sector is that membership and professional associations and the ability to go to these conferences. So we see it as an investment in staff retainage. It also directly benefits the city because the staff learns a lot at those and they&#39;re very enthusiastic to take that knowledge back and apply it to their projects. And in fact, we&#39;ve even sort of instituted I don&#39;t think technically it was a lunch and learn because we didn&#39;t have lunch, but those that go to the conferences are expected to report back and sort of share the knowledge that they gained at that conference with their fellow engineers and project managers. And that&#39;s been a great learning opportunity for us across the board, a lot of technical expertise and we&#39;re even gonna incorporate it into happy hour on Fridays.</td>

Just a couple of weeks ago, we had a few of us went to NACTO which is the National Association for City Transportation Officials. It&#39;s a hard acronym. But it is really key to learn how other communities throughout the country are solving similar problems to us. And it&#39;s important for us to learn that, bring them back here, and figure out which of those solutions work for our community. and figure out ways to share them with other departments and how to implement and execute them in our street construction projects. And we do similar things with other conferences relative to water, sewer, flooding, et cetera.</td>

Medford has less staff than we do, but they also do a fraction of what we do. So I think we&#39;re right size for what our goals are. We certainly aren&#39;t in a position of staff burnout.

Kennedy School Chiller Project, which is heading into its commissioning phase. We&#39;re also embarking on design development for the West Somerville Neighborhood School. And also, conversely, design development for the Healy School. These two projects are focused mainly on mechanical systems and new roofs at both of those locations. And we have some small but impactful projects. At Genziano, we have the small little kitchen upgrades that we did that is winding down and just going through a bunch of those items now. And then we have the Genziano infill classroom. We&#39;re adding an additional classroom up on the third floor in that atrium area that will give the school some additional capacity as well. And we&#39;re working over at 165 Broadway to do some abatement and cleanup of the basement, and then to take care of some shoring needs on the basement slab that is part of that building. It&#39;s an older building, right around 1900, and it needs a little bit of love for sure. But we have, obviously, the Assembly Square Firehouse that we&#39;re getting excited about there. That is hopefully going to come online in about June, July, maybe August. Probably more like in the August-September range. We&#39;re still finishing up some punch list items. There&#39;s some additional work that has to happen in order to get that fully functional and ready to go. Move over there. And DPW. Yes. Yep. We have, we had a consultant in here last week so we can look at completely replacing the roof around the campus of the DPW building. And then also have that solar ready as well so that we could eventually put solar panels on that. Oh, sorry about that. Through the chair city hall roof is another one. Obviously you, That&#39;s very visible up there on Central Hill. We have the clock tower renovation along with the roof itself. And that&#39;s progressing. The roof is almost done. We&#39;re really just focusing now on getting the clock tower done so that we can remove that scaffold and get the small section of flat rubber roof done. And then that project will be fulfilled.</td>

And we have some quite old ones, including our Central Library. And I&#39;m just going to put in a plug. I know we have five-year plans and, you know, ostensibly 10-year plans. I am hopeful that the library will be somewhere within that spectrum because, again, this is a space where we have quite a lot of students, young children, and facilities that are, I will say, confidently older than anyone in this meeting. So we wanna make sure that that is meeting the standard of safety and health that we all want to see in the community. I&#39;ll just ask, since it was brought up about that solar roof, would the green facilities manager be helping with that project or leading it?</td>

Um, it was technically, it was the question before, but I wanted to let counselor Burnley finish, um, looking at the memo and given what we just heard about the mechanicals and roof work, you know, good to hear that the building envelope work has happened in there. Uh, those mechanicals at the turn of the century schools that were mentioned, you mentioned the West, you mentioned the Kennedy and you mentioned the Healy. I didn&#39;t hear Capuano mentioned in there, but I&#39;m going to guess we&#39;re going to need some work at Capuano, uh, given the age of that one as well. Um, Reading this memo, it sounds like my takeaway is that we&#39;re at the point where we have to replace the heating and cooling systems there. We have opted not to go for the reasons listed in the memo, which include difficulty of we&#39;d have to displace those school communities to do that work. I&#39;m going to guess there are some cost considerations as well. We&#39;ve opted, it sounds like, not to replace those heating and cooling systems with green heating and cooling systems, heat pump, right, at this point. So we&#39;re probably talking about, given the average lifespan, another 25 years till that&#39;s going to come back around to us. Do I have all this correct?</td>

                <td>Through the chair, great question. This is something that we are looking very, very hard at. And as we approach each building individually, where we can apply electrification in locations. One hurdle is as you look at electrifying a building, removing any use of natural gas and bump up the energy usage at that building a considerable amount, meaning we have to go approach Eversource to have an upgraded transformer installed. We then have to change up the switch gear in the building itself to accept that additional power that comes in and the distribution of that power that goes up to the mechanical room. So there&#39;s a bit of work that has to happen to turn around and say, okay, let&#39;s put an electric boiler in versus using gas. And even through our work with Eversource, it can take upwards of a year and a half just to get in the queue for a transformer upgrade. Now, having said that, we are working with OSE to begin having some of those discussions with Eversource so that we can begin to get a sense of the cadence and how we can forecast better with the different buildings and what we may be looking at in an overall time span.</td>

We are going to be installing some heat pumps over there as well. And what they help us do is during like shoulder seasons, for instance, a heat pump can only generate a heat, a hot, you know, water in the heating system up to about 130 degrees. So most of our schools are designed to accept 180 degrees, typical in a residential home, like your boiler down the basement, that&#39;s what its output is. So we have that delta, but What it does help is during the shoulder seasons when you don&#39;t necessarily need that full temperature, we can still provide some heating and cooling in September, October, and then again, April and May, depending on how the temperatures line up for us.</td>

Poor DPW Commissioner gets us counselors all the time shouting about what&#39;s happening at these schools. It could be anything from an unseasonably warm day early on where they come home drenched in sweat to a cool day when the AC is still on. So that&#39;s good to hear about the heat pump at the West. Is that something that â I promise I&#39;ll let it go after this, but is that something we&#39;re looking at doing at some of the other schools as well and replicating that approach, or is that a West-only option?</td>

They can produce, you know, hot water at about 130 degrees where, you know, we still have the gas boilers there that will then fire up. But yeah, the west and the healing is going to be a little bit different. That&#39;s mainly looking at the boilers.

And so as a result, we haven&#39;t been able to nail down a revised capital investment plan. That said, the plan is that Director Bean, Master Boney and I will reconvene In July, and with the understanding that there&#39;s still a lot of uncertainty, but at least publish what we know we can do in the interim because there&#39;s certainly a lot of interest in people, knowing what those things are and we do have a lot of projects capital projects in the pipeline.

We have been doing a large amount of work and our senior traffic engineer in particular has been working very closely with both DPW and mobility to really go through and upgrade our walking and accessible pedestrian signals so that they&#39;re meeting the standard of MUTCD and good disability design so that our signals are very comfortable for people of all abilities. So that is something that we have been working with throughout the city and and chipping away at getting more and more of these intersections meeting that positive standard for the city. Yes, you are correct. The traffic signal redesign is the line in the budget that we use to fund that. And we do that in collaboration with the DBW contracts.</td>

I think it&#39;s a really helpful and important change. I look forward to it being across the city. I&#39;ll note again, as I said in a previous meeting a few weeks ago to the director, when I&#39;m at an intersection, whether it&#39;s in this city or any other, that doesn&#39;t have these uh doesn&#39;t have uh audible uh signaling anymore it it&#39;s become such a norm to me at this point that it&#39;s it&#39;s got a little surprising and shocking uh and i worry about the needs of our neighbors um but i did want to just clarify that because there&#39;s as the director knows there&#39;s plenty of different kinds of ways that we can redesign traffic signals that could have been around timing that could have been any sort of number of things. Could you just speak also to this other PTS line for the pavement and sidewalk condition assessment? And what, particularly like what criteria you&#39;re looking at or your department is looking at in terms of where we&#39;re assessing? Is this citywide or are we picking up on specific hot zones?</td>

TAB, Mark McIntyre, And much of it is in the design and preliminary stage but, but this this this budget items going to cover. We&#39;ll cover much of it as we move through and upgrade our signals in much larger scale. Preemption for emergency vehicles. Yes, thank you. Preemption for emergency vehicles. You were asking about pavement and sidewalk condition assessment. We are restarting our pavement and sidewalk condition program. We did this about five years ago. where we went through the city and assessed every street, roadway, and sidewalk, and that was a three-year process to do, and we&#39;re restarting that process again. We anticipate it to be another three-year process, and we&#39;re going to continue with the same schedule that we did last time, start in the west, then the second year in the middle, and then the third year in the east, so that we have a similar time frame of assessment for each section.</td>

When we started this program six years ago, our previous analysis was done in a similar order and we wanted to not leave any particular section of the city more than, you know, we were trying to make sure that every section of the city had an assessment on a very similar timeframe. So if we switched it now, we would have some sections of the city that might be waiting more than six years and other sections of the city having less than three years of a timeframe between assessment. So it&#39;s just to keep it consistent through the city, the timeframe between assessments.</td>

For many, many years, there&#39;s been folks who have said there&#39;s underinvestment, there&#39;s a lack of attention paid more towards the east of the city. I, my instinct is to not replicate that unnecessarily by falling back on tradition. Um, but if there, if there&#39;s compelling reasons for it, I, um, I can, uh, I guess swallow that pill. Um, but again, I, I just know that there&#39;s, there&#39;s so much work that needs to be done, uh, in East Somerville and at the foot of Winter Hill, et cetera. Uh, and you know, I know that many of the folks on this call bike. When I&#39;m in West Somerville, I&#39;m not nearly as concerned, frankly, or when I&#39;m walking around often either in that part of the city as when I am in other parts.

They go to traffic and parking and I don&#39;t always get to chase them down. I guess I can only assume that nobody else thinks they&#39;re dangerous or whatnot. Or maybe they&#39;re being planned or worked on. Usually I&#39;m the last to know. It always comes as a surprise.

I hear you on not knowing and us not having a really good list of what&#39;s coming down the pipe on those because there are just so many different little things and you know, from signals at various intersections throughout the city to reconstruction intersections to all of the hundreds of accessible curb ramps that we have that we&#39;re reconstructing. I&#39;m highlighting the challenge, but I also want to highlight something that we&#39;re working with communications on and developing a page that will highlight what we&#39;re doing in our annual streets projects more clearly to the public and to counselors so that we have a better way of communicating all of the other stuff that we&#39;re doing and not just the larger Complete Streets projects that are fairly well covered on our summer voice and on our city websites. So that is something that we are working on. But maybe I should reach out to you sometime on the side to get a better sense of what your specific interest is.

Is there something that is online that is accessible? Because I can&#39;t even find it, but I knew that. I don&#39;t know who told me that. There was like some list a few years ago, but I saw a spreadsheet that I think Director Reggie, you probably sent it to me or maybe it was somebody else, but this was like six years ago. But is there like a... a list of like this pavement plan, you know, for all the streets in the city where people know when the house is coming, because this is like a constituent that I said, it&#39;s been years, they don&#39;t even know where they are on that list.</td>

On that last year, we developed a map to help describe the different streets and where those streets are located and when and to what degree we&#39;re anticipating doing the construction. We have it highlighted between what is currently in contract because that we know when we&#39;re going to execute the work and the streets that are in the five-year plan. We don&#39;t fine-tune it any further than that down to the five-year plan because from a year-to-year standpoint, we&#39;re trying to collect streets together that make the most sense and can be the most cost-effective to construct. So we&#39;re not mapping out what we&#39;re doing in 2027, what we&#39;re doing in 2028, what we&#39;re doing in 2029. That&#39;s too fine-grained. to manage contracts out that far in advance. But as we get into every year coming up, we are taking from that five-year plan list and pulling together and developing a contract. And when we have that contract settled, that&#39;s when we publish what we&#39;re actually doing in a particular year.

The things that we&#39;re working on in this specific fiscal year coming is replacing the failed boiler plant system at the Brown School, replacing one of the three boilers at the DPW complex, also failed. Key goal, and that is to have those systems running before the heating season starts in three or four months so that we are not saddled with additional temporary mobile boilers in either of those locations, especially Brown. We are looking at currently Matt Bennett mentioned early conversations and exploring replacing the heating plant in the traffic and parking building. This plan is still functional, but it&#39;s well beyond the end of its useful life. We&#39;re trying to do something there before we&#39;re getting pinched into a corner because we have a failure there. We&#39;re also in the midst right now of making our way through the final stages of securing the House Doctor contract to help us, us being BPW, better attack and be more proactive in some of the replacements of systems, systems that aren&#39;t on necessarily the capital department&#39;s radar to the size or planning and where we can to take care of some of the more modern technology, some of the electrification systems that we can do. That is in play right now and hope to have something, I would say, probably in the next couple of months on that. And right now, I think that&#39;s all I can think of at this second. Thank you.</td>

It looks like the OM line is a little bit underspent this year. I&#39;d love to hear any discussion about that. And then also, I was wanting to make sure But I didn&#39;t lose track of the funds that are usually used to hire contractors for maintenance of specialized facilities or places like Lincoln Park. I&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s in the R&amp;M rec facilities, playgrounds, parks and playgrounds line at $740,000. But correct me if I&#39;m wrong on that.

Can I ask what&#39;s, because you don&#39;t really have much about professional and technical services except for that giant $500,000 street sweeping contract, which is coming down by 40 grand. Are we paying for less street sweeping this year than we have in the past, or is there something else in OM that hasn&#39;t</td>

You&#39;ve got, there was 404, there was originally budgeted $404,000 in FY25 for the personal services lines and lights and lines. You know, of course, the vast majority in that in wages and overtime for labor. When I look at the numbers here, it looks like y&#39;all have already spent out to more than that, to $448,000, which I&#39;m kind of confused about seeing as how there&#39;s an existing vacancy there. Obviously, wages might have come up in the last month or two since that contract got put in. But is that overage coming from the overtime line? Or how is it we&#39;ve spent 110% of our personal services budget from last year?</td>

Those being police, animal control, and E911. Am I correct? That is correct, sir. All right. Well, let&#39;s jump back to then back to those three then. So we&#39;re going to start with police. So while we give them a chance to get things sorted on their end, if you have any questions, either follow up questions on the memo. There&#39;s just one question that was asked and answered or questions of your own. Feel free to get those hands up and we can start a queue. We&#39;ve got Counselor Scott first up as soon as we have the police department joining us, followed by Councillor Burnley.</td>

I think you laid out answers that I know I&#39;ve gotten a lot of questions about the overall personal services line, so it&#39;s a good explanation you laid out there. One question I had was about the overtime burn rate in the past year. Just looking at the comparison towards previous years, we seem to be really overshooting our previous rates on overtime relative to when Our previous interim chief was in place, and I see that the overtime line has boosted up. Well, it&#39;s coming up by about 50% this year, by about $700K to $2 million. What is operationally driving that kind of increased overtime burn?</td>

Emily Wisdom, the Director of Admin and Finance. We have Meredith Willis, who is our Senior Crime Analyst, and both deputies are Stanford as well as Deputy Donovan. that are going to be joining me and joining in on responding to the questions. There have been a couple of different drivers that have really underscored those numbers going up. Deputy Stanford will speak in a tad bit more detail, but I will lay the foundation in pointing out some of the FLSA costs that have gone into it, as well as gone to a model for in-service training where individuals have been in-person. That&#39;s proven to be extremely helpful for us as the state has had some challenges with their in-service program. So having our officers for this prior year, having come in full-time in-person to complete their in-service training is one of the primary drivers that has helped to significantly drive that number up. But I do want to pause there and just welcome Deputy Stanford up just to elaborate a little more on that.</td>

The major driver as the chief mentioned was the FLSA. Additional drivers were the sick FMLA component. And vacation with the top 3 components and the drivers for overtime.

In many of these instances, we don&#39;t know that the officials are operating in the city. We get very broad, you know, highly broad, you know, information at best. And oftentimes that information comes from our very community members, which is why we value their trust in our relationships and value it at such a high level. Oftentimes, we&#39;re responding from a reactive position. They come in, they execute, and oftentimes, we get these calls and we go out to triage and, again, try and engage with our community. But certainly, we&#39;re not participating in it. We&#39;ve been very clear on our position, and I submit that we share space around, particularly through our welcoming policy and not participating in immigration enforcement. But oftentimes these actions, by the time we get the call for engagement, is after the action unfortunately has taken place.</td>

We&#39;ve looked at community policing. We&#39;ve looked at recommendations like creating greater balance with our command staff. and creating a command so that we can formalize community policing or reintroduce it into our normal lexicon and how we go about doing business.

That&#39;s been a continual source of conflict between the council and the mayor over previous budget years. I see them in the budget again this year.

We have four police officers that are in the police academy. We have three police officers that are academy trained that are in the pipeline. We have an additional four police officers from that same group that are identified to attend the next available police academy, which at this time is tentatively around October. And we have several positions that have been created as a result of retirement and separation from service from a recruit that was previously in the academy for which we just started the process for hiring those positions. So over the last eight months, we&#39;ve worked incredibly hard to identify all of those positions that were vacant. And at this time, we can go on record saying those six positions that you&#39;re referring to from the beginning of FY25 have been filled and we will continue to work to fill the remaining positions, particularly over the summer months leading into the fall and the first available police academy.</td>

                <td> Hi, through the chair, if I could maybe explain on those positions where you see the bridging, those are for, they have one number beside them for the number of their staffing of the 88 officers. So we have listed one through 88 for the officers. The ones where you see like patrol one and patrol two, those are officers who will meet their date of employment and they will receive a raise post year. So that is trying to show explicitly how much they&#39;re gonna make as a patrol one and how much they&#39;re gonna make as a patrol two. And so the ones that don&#39;t have a number beside them, they go below. So if there&#39;s like number 87, it would be probably a little bit higher up the list. If there&#39;s one that has two numbers with it, that means that person will receive a promotion due to their contract throughout the year. And we wanted to properly show how much of each would be attributed to their grade. So like a patrol one versus a patrol two. Is that helpful through the chair?</td>

We had it down to three and now we&#39;re back up to the six with staffing turnover and changes that we&#39;ve experienced.

There are four police officers that are currently in the police academy. There are three police officers that have academy trained that have been extended conditional offers of employment. That&#39;s seven. We have four of the seven vacancies that are in process to enter the police academy. That&#39;s an additional four. And then again, there are three officers that were currently working through the process. So save for three of them, they have all received conditional office or are in the police academy. So, you know, with the exception of aligning that actual position number that you see in the vacancy aligned with, You can look at that and assume at this juncture, we have four in the academy and seven that have conditional offers of employment. And yes, to your latter part of your question, the civil service process and the alternative hiring process have started to fill the remaining three vacancies.</td>

So as we consider them, what really makes this invaluable to us is that we&#39;re able to take that full-time academy along with their post-certification and really eliminate the six-month training cycle and put them to work. So we do have individuals that have full academies that are being hired through the alternative process, which is parallel to the civil service process. And I&#39;m gonna bring up Deputy Donovan in just a moment, because he really did serve as our point person, if it would be helpful for any context. However, they applied directly to the city of Somerville for a position in one of the conditions where you either didn&#39;t have the academy we would send you through, or you had a full-time academy, which again, had enormous value to us because we&#39;re able to get immediate return on the investment and putting them to work.

                <td>Good evening, Counselor, and for the Chair. Recognizing the difficulty of hiring through civil service, civil service in January initiated an alternative hiring method. Not necessarily outside of civil service, it&#39;s a different version of hiring. It allows us to hire as you would any other employee. We post the job openings from the city website. And we hire through the city website. There are strict guardrails that civil service put up. We have come up with a policy regarding our hiring, what our hiring criteria is going to be. We had to sign MOU with civil service. Civil service had to okay the MOU. And then we can proceed with this hiring method. This hiring method is a five-year look-back period. So when we signed the MOU in January, looking back five years, half of our hires in five years have to be traditional civil service. The other half can be this alternative hiring method. And it allows us to go out and hire officers who have that academy training. Like the chief had said, we hired six officers out of this alternative hiring method. Three of them had previous academies and served in other police departments in the university setting. So we have three officers that allow us to get them on the street within Six weeks of being hired through our abbreviated FTO policy, field training policy, and we&#39;ll have those officers on the street. We would have taken nine months, up to 12 months, actually, when you count the academy and the background checks, we probably did it in three months. So it allowed us for three officers on the street within three months as opposed to a year.</td>

We found ourselves at the police department hiring, so they&#39;re not participating in the alternative hiring method. Although it was passed in September, like any law, CMR, it took HRD at least three to four months to formalize it and get it out to the municipalities. They did training throughout the state. They did a training in Medford. We hosted a training for HRD and they did a training with us. We work closely with HRD and they monitor this hiring method. And we have strict guidelines as to how we go about hiring. I can go into the nitty gritty and I&#39;d be happy to do that tonight if you&#39;d like about our methodology that we use, but it&#39;s very similar to the methodology used by civil service. We used criteria of our applicants. We gave some of our residents the highest criteria. We looked at military veterans, which is similar to civil service as well. We looked at their educational background, their life experience. We&#39;re looking at experience in security, et cetera, and so forth. And then we also looked at academy trained officers, giving them priority. I will say one of our academy trained officers, a lifelong Civil War resident, Suffolk University graduate, a Suffolk University police officer, still lives in the city. And he&#39;ll be starting with us probably within the next few weeks. And he had difficulty getting high through the civil service process.</td>

So, uh, thank you for laying that out. Uh, thank you to my colleagues for your indulgence as I go deep into the weeds on this stuff. And, uh, thank you, chief. Um, I think I&#39;ll have to, I have to give it some more thought as we look at, um, you know, the, the hiring freezes and, uh, and some of the other requirements of the city.

So I thought I will have to, you know, like leave in a few after this because I got to head back home. So excuse the background noise. First, I want to thank the chief and his staff for your work. I appreciate your statement of values that you mentioned vis-a-vis what is currently happening around the country. We&#39;ve had several conversations about various issues regarding public safety in Africa. even just the fact that I just want to pick it back from what Councillor Scott said. I mean, you and I, the last conversation we had was still about like this adoption of plainclothes folks that, you know, come into our community and adopt residents and I asked, is that public safety? I&#39;m still finding ways to comprehend that because as somebody who looks like myself in a community like this, it&#39;s terrifying just to see that people can just get in the community and yet there&#39;s no lack of interception. And so... It&#39;s, yeah, it&#39;s disheartening. And as a follow up to that, I appreciate you reaching out this past weekend also as well, you know, just to, you know, like check on how, you know, we&#39;re doing to update us about this issue. So going back now into this subject matter in terms of like your budget, I guess one of the things that I was also really curious to see was the fact that when I see the elements of programs or maybe say hiring that are included in the added funding, like I was wondering if this new, you know, funding involved also methods of alternative response to emergencies that, you know, we have always like this council has, you know, have been advocating for several years. So, Can you just share some light and thoughts about this? Is that funding included in the 311 salary line or in the police salary line? Can you speak to that alternative response to emergency, please?</td>

Again, with regards to alternative response, and we know that there&#39;s been some, you know, difference of philosophical thought on how we get there. There is no doubt that it remains a priority of the administration and certainly for the department to move in that direction. The department and the city are working together in partnership with regards to bringing on the public safety for our manager, who, as I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve heard through other testimony, is going to be charged with broad based implementation of those recommendations across the city and SPD will be a stakeholder at the table as we onboard. In fact, that process is moving forward if we&#39;ve been brought in at this next stage of interviews to ensure that that there&#39;s a logical pathway and our thoughts are being factored and taken into account in vetting the candidates. So we&#39;re looking forward to it. We&#39;ve been engaging in the conversation. We&#39;ve had open conversation with RSJ. I&#39;ve spoken with Director Najim Williams on several occasions to ensure that those lines are open as we continue to move towards that position coming on board and looking forward to that work. So again, I defer over to that manager&#39;s position once each year they come on board and really promoting and carrying to the next level what the implementations are going to be around alternative response.</td>

Certainly with regards to accountability, we have a number of different, we have policies and we have practices to hold officers accountable today. I&#39;m proud of the work that we do, but we also have practices to hold those officers accountable today and look forward to working with the public safety for our manager as they come on and we will most certainly have our core as part of it. And I would expect that a comprehensive program is going to have measurement benchmarks in there that help us really measure the efficacy of the program and the ODIN initiative.</td>

Two that I didn&#39;t hear that were my understanding that were factors in that were additional patrols, additional staffing required in Davis Square last summer and fall. And also just the number of vacancies in the department, right, as we know from, you know, the same with the fire department, when there are vacancies, you have to do You know, the people you do have there working have to work extra shifts, and that can mean overtime.

                <td>Certainly, anytime we have understaffing, particularly through a public safety lens, right, as we all know, and again, my apologies to the chair. As we all know, with public safety, we&#39;re 24-7. We have to staff our positions. We have to have a readiness posture. We have to respond to those community concerns and those calls for service when they come in. So anytime we&#39;re understaffed, that creates enormous stress and strain on current officers because they often have what we refer to as forced shifts or holdover shifts. And it requires that we run a significant amount of overtime to maintain our staffing levels. Very specifically, as we think about Some of the things that the deputy mentioned earlier around some of the things that I tried to prioritize to promote community safety when we think about things like porch fest. By any measure, we were under-resourced as it relates to public safety. And that was very clear and will continue to be clear. It&#39;s not about over-policing. It&#39;s certainly not about creating the image of a police state. But it is most certainly about ensuring that we have a readiness posture to ensure that all those that want to enjoy our community can do that. but also we have a posture to keep folks safe if things go wrong. We had a number of other things that occurred during this same period. A number of significant meetings at the city council where we had large gatherings. The untimely removal and taking into custody of Alvarez Mesa up at Tufts University. Within 12 hours, they were able to organize a public gathering that brought 2,500 to 3,000 people into the city. We had the Tappan Tower Partnerships with Tufts University Police, with the state police, with a range of different resources to help us, again, keep people safe. We can look at the fireworks celebration that&#39;s coming up. We had an unfortunate incident several years ago. We want to ensure that when people come out in our community that they know that we have the strongest safety posture that we could possibly promote. And also, at the same time, not feeling overwhelmed by the police resources, but the hard reality based on some of the lessons that we learned this past weekend. is we have bad actors that can and will come into our community. We have agitators that get paid. We have agitators that for some reason, that&#39;s certainly beyond my level of comprehension, that find it enjoyable to bring violence and to bring disruption to communities. All of those things are realities. Those are all things that we have to take into account And we&#39;re just not willing to compromise as it relates to keeping you, our community safe, and those that come in to visit our city safe when they come in to participate in a peaceful way and certainly take advantage of the great cultural diversity we have in our city.</td>

I want to ask really directly, to what extent did the additional patrols and overtime in Davis Square in the summer and fall impact overtime? Because I&#39;ve attended the Davis Square merchants meetings. We&#39;ve heard you talk there about what was done in the summer and fall. I don&#39;t think you said it wasn&#39;t sustainable, but you definitely talked about the costs involved with that and the how it was resource intensive.

One, we did use on-duty resources to help offset that, but you did hear me say that it was unsustainable. When we think about our entire city, the range of resources that we brought into Davis Square to help meet that moment were unsustainable if we had three, four, five other locations across the city looking for the same return. So when we talk about inclusiveness and we talk about equitability, we want to ensure that we have the greatest possibility of being able to respond to our community at large. So it was a combination of on-duty resources, and it certainly was a combination of those that were, in many of those instances, on overtime that was brought into Davis Square to help us meet that moment. But I do want to pause and just bring up the... Anything to add? Okay. Anything to add? They don&#39;t have anything to add. My apologies.</td>

                <td>Thank you, through the chair. You know, I was going to let it go as the hour is late, but since there were a number of comments made by colleagues and the chief that you know, really touched toward my heart. I had felt I should speak, uh, counselor and Bob, who no longer in this meeting, uh, did reference, uh, Said Faisal, who, uh, was killed by Cambridge PD, um, in 2023, uh, during a mental health crisis, uh, graduate of Somerville high. Um, his face is on the mural across from the mystics, um, And his death is, you know, an incredibly tragic and unfortunate and local example of the dangers potentially of sending armed force to folks who are experiencing crisis. Now, I say that both because it was brought up, but also because it ties back into the conversation about alternatives that was being discussed earlier, alternative emergency response. I&#39;ve said it before, and I&#39;ll say it again, and this does get to a budgetary question around patrols, but just to be clear, alternative emergency response and co-response are two definitionally different things. Trying to build an alternative emergency response out of co-response would be like trying to make a fire with a water balloon that didn&#39;t have rubber. It just doesn&#39;t work unless you got some explosives. But because of that, I do want to kind of note that I personally do not see anything in here in this budget. that speaks to building an alternative partnership response program. I did want to pivot back to patrols because Councilor Scott asked a question quite similar to one I hoped to ask, but I think I&#39;ll just ask it a slightly different way because in the operations and staffing study that he was referencing, the recommendation for is to eliminate the ward-based patrol beat structure as the requirement of having allocating officers by ward doesn&#39;t match calls to service equitably. And in doing so, according to the second study that effectively asked the city to do this, we could reduce patrol officers while maintaining at least level service without, if we change the structure of how this was organized. So just to be clear, through you to the chief, does this budget with the 80, let&#39;s say 83 for now, 86 and 88, potentially soon. Does this maintain the ward-based structure for patrols? To the chair, yes, it does, Counselor. All right, thank you. Another recommendation on there, yeah, nothing more to be said there. Another recommendation on there was the establishment of non-sworn community service officers. One example that was referenced in the report was cahoots, which is probably the most cited example. And I know that the chief is familiar with it. Is there anything in the budget that is establishing a cahoot style program?</td>

There&#39;s a lot of work that has to go into establishing a program. And that is why it&#39;s so important to do it deliberately to work through a manager. I think in maybe some of your earlier communications, you talked about a consultant to help advise. in that space. And when we look at that model that you referenced with regards to the non-sworn, I think it recommended something like 12 additional bodies to be able to support that model and that response. So I think there&#39;s a tremendous opportunity to have the conversation And again, as I mentioned earlier, I know that there are differences of opinions with regards to what that looks like. Certainly building on one of the recommendations that again, that&#39;s in the staffing study, it talks about potentially using CORE as a base to start the conversation. It is somewhere for us to start the discussion. What we have done internally is we have had conversations internally with CORE. I have asked them to start to think outside the box around what that might look like, what can we work with with the resources that we have, what might additional resources and capacity resources that come into the department through the core program, how can that possibly help us rethink co-response or alternative response? But certainly as it relates to those 12 positions, that is a discussion that would require a lot more detail, certainly a lot more discussion with a number of different stakeholders in that space.</td>

But respectfully, thinking outside the box, the box is SPD. The alternative emergency response, by its definitional nature, existing within SPD would be a contradiction. So I wish everyone luck with their creativity and their thoughtfulness. But when I talk to folks and they say they wish they had an option to call someone who did not have a gun or did not have handcuffs, that they don&#39;t want to be calling the police department, period. And again, that is not to say someone doesn&#39;t want to or that everyone&#39;s going to stop trying to do that. But again, as it pertains to that actual desire within the community, this budget leaves me wanting. I&#39;ll leave my comments there.</td>

I don&#39;t see a professional technical services line. I&#39;m curious if there&#39;s been any discussion and especially discussion of allocation of funds regarding either software or building out another phone service, essentially, routing calls for what would potentially come out of all of these studies and plannings for a new safety program.</td>

                <td> Thank you to the chair. I think I got the gist of it. So a couple of things. One, with regards to professional annual in-service training for the dispatchers, they are supported through a grant that helps us offset costs to keep them training with minimum certifications as articulated by the state. Secondly, as we talked about, right, building out this capacity for considering an alternative response model or other responses to different crises. Those are some of the things that have come up in discussions around, are we asking the right questions? Does the technology, is the technology flexible enough to be able to add different benchmarks in there so that we know when a different response is required. There are a couple of additional resources that may be able to be brought to bear once we do it. The state has a number of technical grants that are available to support technology software upgrades. The state&#39;s department of E911 also supports the CAD system, so fairly confident that we&#39;d be able to have a robust conversation in that space. as there are other jurisdictions in Massachusetts that do have alternative response models. I do think that we would have certainly a basis for getting information and maybe even more solid base with regards to additional resource to help us as a jurisdiction meet that capacity once we get there.</td>

                <td>All right. Through the chair, I actually really appreciate that answer, partially because it reminded me of something I already know, which is that Awasi grants can be used to build up 911 services, these kind of services in particular, from my research and into their usage. So I know that that is out there, but I&#39;m satisfied. Given what I&#39;ve seen as a counselor and the variety of grants for public safety, I&#39;m satisfied with the response that this could be funded through a grant that would be received outside of the general budget. With that, I&#39;m glad the conversations are happening. I hope they are made concrete within FY26, if possible.</td>
