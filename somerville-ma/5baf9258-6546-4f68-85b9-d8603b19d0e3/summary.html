Parking addressed the self-sustaining nature of safety sticks and staffing challenges. Water and Sewer faced scrutiny regarding its budget discrepancies and the equity of its rate structure. IAM and Capital Projects detailed ongoing and future infrastructure initiatives, including school renovations and the challenges of electrification. DPW discussed fleet needs, major projects across its divisions, and the "Let's Get Working" program. The Police Department addressed rising overtime costs, staffing vacancies, and the implementation of alternative hiring methods, while Animal Control and E911 discussed staffing and operational needs.</p>

<h3 id="executive-administration">Executive Administration</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dues and Memberships:</strong><ul>
<li>Councilor Burnley inquired about the nearly $50,000 annual expenditure on dues and memberships.</li>
<li>Chief of Staff Nikki provided a list of organizations: Mayor's Innovation Project, National League of Cities, MAPC (Metro Mayors), MMA, U.S. Conference of Mayors, and recently added ICMA.</li>
<li>Breakdown of anticipated costs for the current year:<ul>
<li>Mayor's Innovation Project: $2,500</li>
<li>National League of Cities: $7,651</li>
<li>MAPC (Metro Mayors): $15,000</li>
<li>MMA: $15,256</li>
<li>U.S. Conference of Mayors: $6,149</li>
<li>ICMA: $1,200</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Chief of Staff Nikki offered to submit a detailed breakdown.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Summer Youth Program:</strong><ul>
<li>Councilor Burnley noted that over a third of the FY25 funding for the youth program remained unspent.</li>
<li>Chief of Staff Nikki explained that $470,000 was budgeted, with approximately $300,000 spent to date and an anticipated additional $44,000 expenditure before year-end, leaving a significant remainder.</li>
<li>Reasons for underspending include student attrition and the challenge of accurately budgeting for participation.</li>
<li>The program has increased spending compared to previous years due to a higher number of students and the expansion of roles and jobs available during the school year, making it a year-round "youth jobs program."</li>
<li>The FY26 budget for this line item has been reduced by $40,000, which is not expected to impact the program due to prior underspending and increased flexibility.</li>
<li>The administration plans to expand the year-round youth jobs program in FY26, in partnership with the Youth Services Division and other city departments, based on recommendations from a youth services needs assessment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Internal System Integration and Technology Modernization Plan (Goal 3):</strong><ul>
<li>Councilor Mbah asked how the plan ensures equitable access for residents facing digital divides.</li>
<li>Chief Administrative Officer Vargas explained that a steering committee with representatives from different departments will define objectives for modernizing internal systems and service delivery.</li>
<li>A software audit will inventory software used by each department to identify cost-effective umbrella licenses and assess how software impacts the external community, including accessibility for individuals with disabilities and language access.</li>
<li>The vendor self-service application, implemented in the previous year, is providing feedback from vendors and stakeholders, which will inform language access solutions (e.g., Google Translate integration).</li>
<li>Goal 4, focusing on intranet development, will ensure collected information is stored and accessible internally.</li>
<li>Chief of Staff Nikki added that OSPCD and libraries also work on digital access and the digital divide.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Digital Innovation Officer:</strong><ul>
<li>Councilor Clingan clarified that the Digital Innovation Officer position, while not new, was transferred from SomerStat to Executive Administration in FY25 (previously FY24).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Public Safety for All Project Manager:</strong><ul>
<li>Councilor Clingan questioned why this position is under the Mayor's Office rather than Racial and Social Justice.</li>
<li>Chief of Staff Nikki stated it is a temporary, grant-funded position that rolls up under the Mayor's Office but partners closely with the Racial and Social Justice team.</li>
<li>The role is to coordinate the implementation of over 70 recommendations from the Public Safety for All reports across various departments (public safety, RSJ, HR, law), requiring complex project management.</li>
<li>The position's placement under the Mayor's Office is due to its city-wide coordination role and the need for executive decisions on funding and implementation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="emergency-management">Emergency Management</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Staffing and Budget:</strong><ul>
<li>Director William Fisher and Deputy Director Lauren Mahoney were hired in June and January, respectively.</li>
<li>The department's FY25 budget is currently underspent by approximately 60% (40% burn rate).</li>
<li>Director Fisher explained that some invoices are still in process, and the initial budget was created in anticipation of the positions, not based on specific needs. The department has been responsible with funds and aims for a more in-line budget for FY26.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Federal Support and Local Resiliency:</strong><ul>
<li>Councilor Scott raised concerns about declining federal emergency management support and the need for robust local capacity.</li>
<li>Director Fisher agreed, emphasizing building resiliency within Somerville through a "whole community approach" involving residents, businesses, and volunteer groups.</li>
<li>FY26 goals include business continuity planning to mitigate impacts on critical infrastructure and the economy, and active community engagement to identify needs and hazards.</li>
<li>The FY26 budget includes an $8,000 increase for community outreach, which will fund supplies and programming.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Scope of Work and Expectations:</strong><ul>
<li>Councilor Clingan asked about the department's scope of work, particularly regarding school building alternatives in emergencies (e.g., Winter Hill School).</li>
<li>Director Fisher clarified that school departments have their own emergency preparedness personnel.</li>
<li>The department aims to define its scope through community partnership, understanding what Somerville residents expect.</li>
<li>The Somerville Emergency Management Group, a coalition of departments, meets regularly for planning, training, and mitigation.</li>
<li>Director Fisher acknowledged the need for better community outreach to showcase the department's work and gather input.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Warming Center Operations:</strong><ul>
<li>Councilor Mbah inquired about ensuring equitable access and responsiveness to unhoused residents' lived experiences in warming center operations.</li>
<li>Director Fisher detailed a comprehensive after-action review of the Cummings School warming center, including surveys for residents, staff, and community members, and a public listening session.</li>
<li>The after-action report, expected within the next month, will inform improvements for future operations.</li>
<li>Director Fisher emphasized that "not everyone comes to a disaster from the same place," highlighting the department's commitment to understanding diverse impacts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Definition of Emergency:</strong><ul>
<li>Councilor Burnley commended the broad definition of "emergency" and the department's focus on community impact.</li>
<li>Director Fisher reiterated that his focus is on how an event affects the community and their need for assistance, regardless of the specific type of emergency.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>FY26 Goals:</strong><ul>
<li>Develop, finalize, and begin implementation of a comprehensive city and business continuity operation plan.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="fire-department">Fire Department</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Assembly Square Station:</strong><ul>
<li>The Assembly Square station is nearing completion, with an anticipated opening in the August-September range, pending final punch list items.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Staffing:</strong><ul>
<li>The department will have 164 firefighters once hiring is complete, with the last firefighter starting on June 23rd.</li>
<li>Assistant Chief Tanney clarified that the previous budget book's 172 positions included some double-counted positions due to step increases.</li>
<li>The department is at 100% staffing for the first time in a while.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Overtime Budget:</strong><ul>
<li>The overtime budget has "very sufficient funds."</li>
<li>The FY25 overtime budget was increased proactively to ensure adequate staffing for the Assembly Square station if it opened early, before new recruits completed the academy.</li>
<li>Councilor Scott noted the overtime budget is approximately 10-15% of the salary line.</li>
<li>Assistant Chief Tanney will monitor the impact of the additional 12-16 members on overtime usage.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Apparatus Staffing:</strong><ul>
<li>Each apparatus is staffed with a Lieutenant and two firefighters, with some staffed with a Lieutenant and three.</li>
<li>Assistant Chief Tanney stated he would need to consult the roster to identify which apparatus are staffed with three.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Professional and Technical Services:</strong><ul>
<li>The reduction in this line item for FY26 is due to no longer needing to budget for Metro Fire Academy or Boston Fire Academy costs, as state academies are free.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Call for Service Data:</strong><ul>
<li>FY25 call for service numbers appear lower because the data only extends to May 1st, missing two months of data.</li>
<li>Assistant Chief Tanney declined to predict future call volumes, citing the unpredictable nature of emergencies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Language Access:</strong><ul>
<li>Assistant Chief Tanney announced that Meredith Gamble will be training firefighters on available language services (e.g., an app for direct communication) within the next couple of weeks to overcome language barriers during medical calls.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Hazardous Duty Stipend:</strong><ul>
<li>The $300,000 increase is due to collective bargaining agreements (CBA).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Medical and Dental Services:</strong><ul>
<li>The $221,000 budgeted for medical and dental services (previously zero in this line) is a reclassification.</li>
<li>Jonathan Mancino explained that these funds were moved from the Personnel Services (PS) side of the budget to the Ordinary Maintenance (OM) side to align with proper accounting for injury invoices, similar to the Police Department.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Training and Certification:</strong><ul>
<li>The increase in this line item reflects more firefighters pursuing degrees and certifications in technical rescue (e.g., water rescue), as well as CBA-negotiated stipends for certifications.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Perfect Attendance Line:</strong><ul>
<li>The zero budgeted for perfect attendance in FY26 will be funded through "lag" (salary savings from vacancies) and leftover money from other PS lines, as per the CBA.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="parking">Parking</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Safety Sticks:</strong><ul>
<li>Director Renfrew confirmed that safety sticks are self-sustaining and do not cost the city anything, as revenue is shared from tickets.</li>
<li>The FY25 budget for safety sticks was an estimate, and the FY26 budget reflects actual historical data.</li>
<li>Safety sticks have expanded beyond Davis and Magoun to Assembly Row and the corner of Hamlet and Highland Ave, focusing on safety violations (bus stops, bus lanes, fire lanes, crosswalks) to enhance Vision Zero initiatives and improve MBTA bus flow.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Curb Space Management and Equitable Access:</strong><ul>
<li>Councilor Mbah asked how the department balances enforcement with equitable access, especially in high-density areas.</li>
<li>Director Renfrew explained that the Parking Department enforces regulations set by the Traffic Commission, working with Mobility and Engineering.</li>
<li>Loading zones have been rebranded with pictorial signs (e.g., "5 minute passenger, 20 minute commercial") to be more inviting and understandable, encouraging legal parking.</li>
<li>Mobility redesigns prioritize loading zones and accessible spots based on parking study recommendations.</li>
<li>Long-term parking is encouraged on side streets or in underutilized lots.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Staffing:</strong><ul>
<li>Front clerks are fully staffed and satisfied with recent wage increases.</li>
<li>The department is down a few Parking Control Officers (PCOs) due to a transfer and attrition but is actively interviewing to fill vacancies.</li>
<li>Director Renfrew noted that increased salaries have improved retention.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Automated Enforcement:</strong><ul>
<li>Councilor Scott inquired about budgeting for automated enforcement on traffic signals, as per a recent home rule petition.</li>
<li>Director Renfrew stated that moving violation enforcement falls under the Police Department.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>New Van for Animal Control:</strong><ul>
<li>Councilor Scott asked if Animal Control had received a new van.</li>
<li>Director Renfrew confirmed they have a "modern and contemporary van," a 2024 model, sufficient for their work.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="water-and-sewer-enterprise-fund">Water and Sewer (Enterprise Fund)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Poplar Street Storm Sewer Tank:</strong><ul>
<li>Councilor Mbah asked about the final cost of the Poplar Street Storm Sewer Tank project.</li>
<li>Director Raish stated the tank is nearly complete, and the project is approximately halfway through its overall scope (including pump station and McGrath pipe crossing).</li>
<li>Most aspects are tracking within the $88 million budget, but an unforeseen cost for PCB disposal (due to EPA rule changes) will require a supplemental appropriation, expected in July.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Parkland Improvement on Tank:</strong><ul>
<li>Director Raish confirmed that design for the park on top of the tank has begun, with a separate general fund appropriation for the park expected within a year.</li>
<li>The estimated cost is still being refined, but previous estimates have ranged from $4 million to $20 million.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Budget Discrepancies:</strong><ul>
<li>Councilor Burnley noted that the "delta" column in the budget book appeared to be a copy of the FY26 column, not the difference, causing confusion.</li>
<li>Director Raish acknowledged the error and explained that as an enterprise budget, expenditures cannot exceed revenue.</li>
<li>The department has realigned line items, including personnel, to maximize limited funds, resulting in a decrease in many expenses.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Rate Structure and Expenditures:</strong><ul>
<li>Director Raish stated that changes to the rate structure do not directly impact annual expenditures, as the budget must be balanced.</li>
<li>The department has eliminated three positions (safety and training coordinator, executive administrative assistant, and an engineering position) to create capacity for four new positions (two principal clerks, two new managers) focused on customer service and billing.</li>
<li>The goal is to fill "boots on the ground" positions as soon as possible to reduce reliance on contractors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Water Meter Replacement Project:</strong><ul>
<li>The project is 94% complete.</li>
<li>The $1.6 million budgeted for the project in FY26 will cover remaining installations, maintenance for new meters (via an upcoming RFP), and purchasing new equipment for new developments.</li>
<li>The goal is to complete the project and transition to a maintenance plan, potentially allowing for rate adjustments for ratepayers in the future.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Billing Discrepancies:</strong><ul>
<li>Councilor Scott questioned the discrepancy between 16,000 accounts and 51,000 annual bills, given tri-annual residential billing and bi-monthly commercial billing.</li>
<li>Director Raish clarified that commercial accounts are billed bi-monthly (every other month), and residential accounts are billed every four months.</li>
<li>He acknowledged that the 51,000 figure was an estimate and that the department is working to identify and bill "a few hundred meters that actually don't have accounts" to maximize revenue.</li>
<li>The department aims for a consistent quarterly billing pattern for all accounts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Equity in Water Rate Structure:</strong><ul>
<li>Councilor Mbah asked about the equity lens applied to the new water rate structure, particularly for low-income households.</li>
<li>Director Raish explained that the rate restructure aims to shift the burden from two- and three-family residential properties (which historically paid a disproportionate share) to larger industrial users, promoting "fairness" and "equity."</li>
<li>He noted that Massachusetts law currently prohibits ratepayer assistance programs within enterprise funds, but the department continues to explore needs-based subsidy programs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Commercial vs. Residential Accounts:</strong><ul>
<li>Councilor Scott sought clarification on how accounts are classified as commercial, given the low number of commercial accounts cited.</li>
<li>Director Raish explained that mixed-use properties are considered commercial, and classification is tied to how properties are taxed. He offered to provide more detailed information.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="infrastructure-and-asset-management-iam">Infrastructure and Asset Management (IAM)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ordinary Maintenance (OM) Spending:</strong><ul>
<li>Councilor Scott noted that IAM's FY25 OM spending is significantly underspent (just over 20% burn rate) compared to the five-year average.</li>
<li>Director of Finance and Administration Michael Richards explained that this is largely due to delays in procuring and implementing CMMS (Computerized Maintenance Management System) software.</li>
<li>$350,000 was budgeted for CMMS ($200k for software, $150k for implementation services), but only $90,000-$92,000 has been encumbered for initial design work due to project constraints.</li>
<li>The FY26 budget for this line item mirrors the FY25 amount, as the department expects to "hit the ground running" with implementation in FY26.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Photocopier Expense (Equipment Line):</strong><ul>
<li>Councilor Burnley questioned a significant spike in the equipment line.</li>
<li>Director Raish clarified that the $18,950 budgeted for a photocopier and other office equipment (e.g., water cooler, cubicles) is to facilitate the move of IAM or another department into new space, and IAM is holding this budget item.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Dues and Memberships:</strong><ul>
<li>Councilor Burnley noted that FY25 actuals for dues and memberships were 50% over budget.</li>
<li>Director Raish explained that IAM added two new city-wide memberships to organizations focused on clean water strategy and federal funding (related to CSO program), in addition to staff memberships. These were unexpected and unbudgeted for FY25.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Professional Learning Investment and Community Benefit:</strong><ul>
<li>Councilor Mbah asked how increased out-of-state travel and staff development benefit frontline communities facing infrastructure challenges.</li>
<li>Director Raish explained that these investments help retain staff (who might otherwise go to higher-paying consulting firms) by offering professional development opportunities.</li>
<li>Staff learn new knowledge at conferences and share it internally through "lunch and learns" and other sessions, applying it to projects.</li>
<li>Director of Capital Projects Ralph Henry added that attending conferences like NACTO (National Association for City Transportation Officials) allows staff to learn how other cities solve similar problems and bring those solutions back to Somerville.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Staffing Capacity:</strong><ul>
<li>Councilor Clingan inquired about IAM's staffing capacity compared to similar cities.</li>
<li>Director Raish stated that IAM is fully staffed except for one bond-funded Senior Project Manager position that has not been funded in several years.</li>
<li>He believes Somerville does "way more per person" than Cambridge (with about half the staff) and significantly more than Medford, indicating efficient use of resources without staff burnout.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="capital-projects">Capital Projects</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>FY26 Projects:</strong><ul>
<li>Director Ralph Henry outlined major projects:<ul>
<li>Wrapping up John F. Kennedy School Chiller Project.</li>
<li>Design development for West Somerville Neighborhood School (mechanical systems, new roofs).</li>
<li>Design development for Healy School (mechanical systems, new roofs).</li>
<li>Small kitchen upgrades at Genziano.</li>
<li>Genziano infill classroom (adding a classroom on the third floor).</li>
<li>Abatement, cleanup, and shoring at 165 Broadway.</li>
<li>Assembly Square Firehouse (nearing completion, expected August-September).</li>
<li>DPW campus roof replacement (solar-ready).</li>
<li>City Hall roof and clock tower renovation (roof almost done, focusing on clock tower).</li>
<li>Working through MSBA process for Winter Hill/Brown School replacement (potential $250 million project).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Councilor Burnley advocated for addressing the Central Library's age and condition in future plans.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Green Facilities Manager:</strong><ul>
<li>The Green Facilities Manager position is based at Somerville High School, assisting with the transition and operation of the state-of-the-art building and troubleshooting systems.</li>
<li>The manager also monitors building management systems (e.g., West Branch Library, JFK School) for energy usage and performance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>School Electrification:</strong><ul>
<li>Councilor Scott asked about the timeline for electrifying school heating/cooling systems.</li>
<li>Director Henry explained that electrifying buildings requires significant upgrades to electrical infrastructure (Eversource transformer upgrades, building switchgear), which can take over a year and a half to get in the queue.</li>
<li>The West Somerville Neighborhood School will include heat pumps for air conditioning, which can also provide heating during "shoulder seasons" (September/October, April/May) when full boiler heat isn't needed.</li>
<li>This modular chiller technology is also at JFK School, and the department is exploring creative solutions for Healy and other schools.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Capital Investment Plan (CIP):</strong><ul>
<li>Councilor Clingan noted the absence of a CIP tab in the current budget book.</li>
<li>Director Raish explained that financial uncertainties (e.g., 90 Washington judgment) have complicated the long-term CIP.</li>
<li>Director Bean, Mike Mastroboni, and Director Raish plan to reconvene in July to publish a revised CIP, with a presentation to the council hoped for after summer recess.</li>
<li>Councilor Clingan inquired about the status of the Broadway makeover (Winter Hill area). Director Raish stated he did not have a quick answer but would highlight it when the CIB is updated.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="department-of-public-works-dpw">Department of Public Works (DPW)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Jail Diversion Program:</strong><ul>
<li>Councilor Burnley asked why the Jail Diversion Program is housed in DPW.</li>
<li>Director of Operations Eric Wiseman explained that it's historically hosted through the Admin Division because participants provide staff support to grounds, buildings, and snow operations across multiple DPW divisions.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Councilor Mbah noted that the Public Works budget is largely unchanged except for a substantial increase in the Highway Division's salary line.</li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Sanitation Procurement and Accountability:</strong><ul>
<li>Councilor Mbah asked how community priorities, especially from environmental justice communities, are incorporated into future sanitation services, and what accountability measures ensure timely payment for minority/women-owned businesses.</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Grounds OM Spending:</strong><ul>

</ul>
</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Highway OM Spending:</strong><ul>
<li>Councilor Scott noted a 35% burn rate on Highway's FY25 OM lines.</li>
<li>Superintendent Barbier stated that the decrease in the street sweeping debris line (part of the $500,000 street sweeping contract) is based on analysis of previous spending.</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Lights and Lines Staffing:</strong><ul>
<li>Councilor Scott inquired about a vacant electrician position.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Overtime Burn Rate:</strong><ul>
<li>Councilor Scott noted a significant increase in overtime burn rate compared to previous years, with the FY26 overtime line increasing by 50% ($700K to $2 million).</li>
<li>Chief Benford explained drivers for the increase:<ul>
<li>FLSA (Fair Labor Standards Act) costs.</li>
<li>Sick FMLA (Family and Medical Leave Act) and vacation.</li>
<li>Shift to in-person in-service training (40 hours minimum per officer), which is more costly than online training and requires additional overtime to cover patrol shifts.</li>
<li>Expansion of the SIT (Special Investigations Team) unit (hostage negotiators, de-escalation, firearms qualification).</li>
<li>Increased community engagement initiatives.</li>
<li>Increased staffing for special events (e.g., PorchFest, fireworks, large gatherings at City Council) to ensure security, which requires overtime.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Deputy Stanford provided a 15% increase figure for FY25 overtime costs.</li>
<li>Chief Benford acknowledged that additional patrols in Davis Square last summer/fall were "unsustainable" due to resource intensity, contributing to overtime.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Federal Law Enforcement Actions:</strong><ul>
<li>Councilor Scott asked about initiatives to prevent federal officers from breaking laws during apprehensions, given concerns about federal administration tactics.</li>
<li>Chief Benford stated the department's position is clear: they follow laws, partner with community stakeholders, and do not participate in immigration enforcement (welcoming policy).</li>
<li>He noted that often, the department is reactive, responding after federal actions have taken place, and relies on community trust for information.</li>
<li>Increased patrols around faith-based institutions due to recent violence were also mentioned.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Staffing Studies and Recommendations:</strong><ul>
<li>Councilor Scott inquired about the implementation of staffing study recommendations, particularly regarding reducing staffing levels.</li>
<li>Chief Benford stated the department has implemented a number of recommendations, focusing on repurposing staff and increasing capacity within the current authorization (88 patrol officers).</li>
<li>This includes creating greater balance in command staff and formalizing community policing.</li>
<li>He clarified that the staffing study recommended repurposing, not eliminating, staffing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Patrol Officer Vacancies:</strong><ul>
<li>Councilor Scott questioned the presence of six vacant patrol officer positions (83-88) in Appendix B of the budget.</li>
<li>Chief Benford and Director of Admin and Finance Emily Wisdom clarified that while there were six vacancies at the start of FY25, the department has aggressively worked to fill them.</li>
<li>Currently, four officers are in the police academy, three academy-trained officers have conditional offers, and four more are identified for the next academy.</li>
<li>Recent retirements and separations have led to new vacancies, bringing the current number back to six.</li>
<li>The civil service and alternative hiring processes have been initiated to fill the remaining three vacancies.</li>
<li>Councilor Scott requested an offline list of names and statuses for clarity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Alternative Hiring Pathway:</strong><ul>
<li>Councilor Scott asked about lateral transfer hires and the alternative hiring path.</li>
<li>Chief Benford confirmed three candidates with prior academy training are being hired through the alternative hiring process (not traditional civil service). These individuals are post-certified and can be put to work quickly.</li>
<li>Deputy Donovan explained that the alternative hiring method, initiated by civil service in January, allows cities to post job openings directly. It has strict guardrails, requires an MOU with civil service, and mandates that half of hires over a five-year period must be traditional civil service.</li>
<li>This method allows for hiring academy-trained officers, significantly reducing the time to get them on the street (e.g., three months instead of nine to twelve).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Alternative Response to Emergencies:</strong><ul>
<li>Councilor Mbah asked if funding for alternative response to emergencies is included in the budget.</li>
<li>Chief Benford stated that while alternative response remains a priority, there is no specific funding in the budget for a new program.</li>
<li>The Public Safety for All manager (a city-wide position) will be charged with broad implementation of recommendations, with SPD as a stakeholder.</li>
<li>The department is engaging with RSJ and CORE to explore how existing resources and future CORE program capacity can support co-response or alternative response.</li>
<li>Councilor Burnley expressed concern that existing within SPD would be a contradiction to the definitional nature of alternative emergency response, which seeks options without armed officers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Behavioral Health Enhancement and Accountability:</strong><ul>
<li>Councilor Mbah asked about accountability metrics for alternative response strategies, particularly in reducing harm outcomes for individuals in mental health crises.</li>
<li>Chief Benford stated that the Public Safety for All manager will help lay out a strategy for engaging stakeholders and implementing policies.</li>
<li>He expects a comprehensive program to include measurement benchmarks to assess efficacy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="animal-control">Animal Control</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Staffing:</strong><ul>
<li>Councilor Burnley noted that Animal Control has historically been staffed by two individuals.</li>
<li>Chief Benford stated that the two positions have been sufficient based on call volume, and there are no current plans to add additional staff.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>New Van:</strong><ul>
<li>Councilor Scott inquired about a new van for Animal Control.</li>
<li>Chief Benford confirmed they have a "modern and contemporary" 2024 model van.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="e911">E911</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Staffing Vacancy:</strong><ul>
<li>Councilor Clingan noted that the budget book lists an E911 operator position as filled by an individual who recently passed away.</li>
<li>Chief Benford acknowledged the passing and stated the department is moving forward to fill the vacancy, which is currently posted.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Professional Technical Services and Alternative Response:</strong><ul>
<li>Councilor Burnley noted the absence of a professional technical services line in the E911 budget and inquired about discussions for software or phone services for a new safety program.</li>
<li>Chief Benford explained that annual in-service training for dispatchers is supported by grants.</li>
<li>Discussions around alternative response models include assessing technology flexibility for different benchmarks and responses.</li>
<li>The state offers technical grants for software upgrades, and the state's E911 department supports the CAD system, providing potential funding avenues.</li>
<li>Chief Benford expressed confidence in having robust conversations and leveraging state resources, noting that other Massachusetts jurisdictions have alternative response models.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
