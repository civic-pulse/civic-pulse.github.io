All right, the minutes are laid on the table to recommend approval. That&#39;s going to bring us to our second item, ID number 25-1295, request by the mayor, requesting approval to accept and expand a $50,000 grant with no new match required from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs to the Office of Sustainability and Environment for a study investigating possible zoning incentives to increase the ability to comply with the fossil fuel free ordinance. I believe we have, do we have Director Blaise on it? There we are. Director Blaise, welcome. Please tell us about this request.</td>

                <td> Through you. Thank you so much for having us. This is a grant that we originally applied for for $75,000. We were eventually awarded $50,000. It took the state almost a year to get back to us, letting us know that it was approved. So we were grateful that it was approved, albeit at the prorated rate. During that period of time, we wound up going through a request for proposals process to find consultants for the project, and we did enter into a contract in February of this year with VHB, Autocase, and other consultants. This project is aimed at figuring out how to compel compliance with our fossil fuel-free ordinance that the council passed in November of 2023 in our bid to enter into the state&#39;s fossil fuel-free demonstration pilot program. Upon entrance into that pilot program, which we are still hopeful for a couple irons in the fire there that ordinance would go into effect in the manner that prescribed in the ordinance and this study here is aimed at helping us to figure out how do we help bring everybody along on that journey with us and helped sort of decrease the number of folks asking for variances from that ordinance focusing on transformers and how do we, you know, oversize them in our new developments and create community benefits for neighbors and in buildings large and small that are interested in electrifying and more. So the end goal for this project will be to create some recommendations for some zoning amendments to create zoning incentives, and they would be backed by a financial analysis multiple focus groups and lots of research, including with the utilities. So thank you.</td>

                <td> Thank you, Mr. Chair. Again, Michael Richards, Director of Finance and Administration for the Department of Infrastructure and Asset Management. The prior year invoice is related to our strategic asset management program. This is funded to our professional and technical line. This was part of a proposal for roughly $93,000, an ongoing project we&#39;ve been doing for about three years now and kind of coming to a head here. This invoice was dated June 20th and was approved by the project team on June, I&#39;m sorry, it was dated June 5th and approved by the project team on June 20th. This funding source and kind of leading into item 14 here was previously funded out of IAM&#39;s Ordinary Maintenance P&amp;T line. That OM is intended to be fiscal year purchases, pens and pencils, conferences, things that are discrete, finite for fiscal year. This line that was created was part of a new department that was created in recent years, IAM, and a bit of an oversight when we initially created this as an OM line as P&amp;T, whereas it should have been a capital outline line for professional and technical aligning with our engineering department and capital projects departments that have a bit more latitude. This is a longitudinal study as we&#39;re evaluating these things from our consultants that span fiscal years. similar to what we see in capital and engineering. However, as a result, as this fiscal year closed, we closed all of our POs, came before this committee to reallocate those funds from capital outlay to a stabilization fund so we can reopen those purchase orders and task orders to start the year. Given that this is an ordinary maintenance account, we were unable to move those funds into a stabilization fund. So we lost about $70,000 or $80,000 actually from that line. Of that, $10,000 for this change, for this invoice, was meant to be paid from that line. So that is the justification for the prior year invoice. And then we also request that this FY26 ordinary maintenance professional and technical amount of 350,000 roughly be moved into a newly created capital outlay professional and technical line. So it&#39;ll again be moving forward approved with the fiscal year budget, but will grant us some latitude to span here, span the fiscal years and move remaining balances on task orders into a stabilization fund.</td>

That&#39;s our 15th agenda item, ID number 25-1411. That&#39;s the mayor requesting an authorization to borrow $4,300,000 in a bond and to appropriate the same amount for the design of the Morrison Avenue Linear Storage Sewer Separation Project. Once again, Director Richards.</td>

We previously had $2 million approved in a bond two years ago, I believe, for the initial design phase up through 30% design. We&#39;re now at a phase, that next phase where we have that 30 through final design and bid administration proposal from our consultant. So we&#39;re asking for that approval That second phase, final phase of design funding here. Of the $4.3 million, we have $3.8 million for the design itself with a proposal in hand from the consultant. And that $500,000 delta is our contingency on there in the event we run into design changes or unforeseen circumstances. All right. This is on our capital plan that was submitted as part of the water and sewer rate study and approved to begin FY26.</td>

So, Councillor Burnley, the The linear component of it is we&#39;re trying to make a rather large, and I wasn&#39;t prepared for this question, so I don&#39;t know the exact numbers off the top of my head. I can get back to you on them if that would be fun. The storage that we&#39;re trying to do is to preload and pre-store stormwater that&#39;s flowing into Davis Square to minimize flooding in Davis Square And because a lot of the flow that goes down Morrison, actually all the flow that goes down Morrison goes through Davis square, but there&#39;s no room in Davis square to put a tank, um, the size that we would need. So instead what we&#39;ve found would be a good solution is since Morrison&#39;s a rather long street, what we&#39;ll do is we&#39;ll put in a large diameter pipe, much larger than we would need to actually transport the flow. so that we can use the volume of that pipe to store the water. And so basically, so that&#39;s why we think of it as linear storage because it&#39;s a big long line of a tank that looks to most people like a big pipe. And so that&#39;s the linear component of the storage.</td>

This body received a memo from our treasurer explaining what led to this. I hope folks had a chance to look at that. Clerk, if you don&#39;t mind just throwing that up on the screen for us, please. That would be great to... I have that up there. Thank you. As we see there, it&#39;s being extended. And staggering end dates seems like a good idea, as the treasurer explains. But any discussion on this? Treasurer does a good job explaining how it happened, why we&#39;re doing this. So I have no questions. I don&#39;t see any from anyone else. So this one&#39;s laid on the table to recommend approval as well. All right, that&#39;s going to bring up, we&#39;re going to take up together four related items, all 299 and Broadway related. We&#39;re going to waive the readings of items 17 to 20 and take those up together. And we have Director Postowait back with us as well as Attorney Salkert.

                <td>Take it away. OK. So apologies. I didn&#39;t introduce myself on the previous item. I&#39;m Brian Polstowate, director of engineering in the IAM department. There are the 299 Broadway project at the old Star Market site, a large affordable housing 40B project in Winter Hill had not an anomaly, but a legacy private way that extended onto or into, might be a better term, into the property of the Star Market parking lot for probably as long as the star market had been there, that old, that in section of the private way was vestigial. It wasn&#39;t used as a private way anymore. It looked and acted like the remainder of the parking lot. But before we go and build, and I guess the other piece, the other piece that it had on it was an old utility easement to the benefit of the city for any sort of utilities that might be located in that private way. Presumably, when Sewell Court was initially built or constructed, there were houses on either side of it. Over the past century, those houses were bought out and turned into the parcels that became the Star Market and were used as the parking lot. Now that mark development is coming in to redevelop and reconstruct the site we felt it important and legally necessary to clean up that component of our our shared deeds on this effort so in working with mark development. We concluded that it was best to discontinue a portion of. sewell court and discontinue or rather terminate a portion of the easement that maps to that discontinuance um neither of those neither the private way that is to be discontinued nor the easement that&#39;s to be terminated um is used or has any value to the city um and in fact it may have more value to the city by returning it to the developer so that the the housing project can move forward. So I believe all of you have a copy of the petition and all the deeds and some drawings, letters from the fire department, as well as from myself regarding the acceptability of this. I think that&#39;s about as brief as I can make it, but if there are any questions, I&#39;m here to help out.</td>

So I have 18 and 20. 20 is actually logically the first one to take because it&#39;s an order of taking and it&#39;s for the acquisition of lot three at 299 Broadway, which is actually depicted on the chart that you were just, or the map that you were just looking at. There should be one. If you zoom out again, you can see in the bottom corner there, lot three is what&#39;s being taken. And the easement back is in item, and lot three is being taken for the purpose of being used as a municipal parking lot and access driveway. Lot one and lot two will have the right to use the access driveway in common with the public and everyone else by virtue of the easement that we&#39;re also executing after the taking. And it sounded like you were asking questions about that. Because we&#39;re taking this before the construction, we are granting an easement that will be temporary for construction purposes so they can use it for lay down and construction. That easement will go away. And you can see in the easement document, if you had a chance to read it, the temporary easement is on page two, and it will remain in place until the construction of building A and building B are complete or the completion of the improvements on lot three, whichever is latest in time. And then the permanent easement will give the, there&#39;s a maintenance easement. They are responsible for, it&#39;s divided into two parts. The access easement is described first in paragraph B, and then paragraph C is the permanent maintenance easement. We do expect easement. the owner of lot one and lot two to have a non-exclusive perpetual easement to maintain, repair, or replace the lot three improvements, similar with most of our easements where we own something and take it back if it&#39;s being used. If it&#39;s being improved, we typically do require the owners to maintain those improvements.</td>

                <td>Yes. I&#39;ll start with why I brought it forward, and I&#39;d like to read a section of that memo as well. Just super high level. As everyone on this call knows, our community&#39;s been really just under siege by federal... activity that has taken our neighbors off the streets in really scary and chilling ways. And I think as a sanctuary city, we have the responsibility to do everything that we can to comply with our own laws that are meant to support our neighbors, ensure peaceful processes, and including in law enforcement. And because of that, when it came to my attention that there were new requirements added to the UASI grants that our city regularly uses to enhance capacities, particularly for SPD, but also for various other departments, I became quite concerned. I wanted to make sure that we were not inadvertently committing ourselves legally within contracts with the federal government to taking actions that are contrary to our values and our rights. So in this memo, you&#39;ll see that in this penultimate paragraph, if I could just read a bit, it says that consistent with the NOFOs, which are notice of funding opportunity for prior years, UAC funds recipients must allocate 30% of their awarded funds to specifically enumerated national priority areas. The FY25 NOFOs adds a new condition as a national priority area for, quote, supporting border crisis response and enforcement. Recipients are required to allocate at least 10% of all UAC funds for this new national priority area. The FY25 NOFO does not provide an exhaustive list of programs or investments that would satisfy supporting border crisis response and enforcement, but does list as examples what the Department of Homeland Security would consider a compliant program and includes those that would, one, authorize state and local enforcement officers to perform immigration officer functions, two, cooperate with ICE detainers, or three, support activities such as officer training, technology and information sharing, operational support, and community engagement. Now, personally, I think there is a range of concern I have about any of those. three options. There&#39;s certainly a ranking that I see as totally outside of the realm of our laws as a sanctuary city, particularly the second option there of complying with ICE detainers. Just for a little bit of context, Somerville is a participant in the Boston Regional Intelligence Center. aka BRIC, which brings together Boston and Somerville and Cambridge and Winthrop and Revere and a number of other local jurisdictions for information sharing, including with the federal government. Certainly, there is an argument that participation in BRIC could comply with number three, although I am curious about what information would Somerville be sharing with federal departments through BRIC, which this council is, I would say not overly aware of, or speaking for myself, I would say I&#39;m not personally overly aware of when information gets shared through BRIC from Somerville. So I just wanted to bring to this council&#39;s attention and to the public&#39;s attention a change that may be coming in the forthcoming requests for EWASI funds that we should monitor quite closely in order to ensure that we&#39;re not signing up to do something that we have no desire to do or that is contrary to our own wants. But I&#39;ll pause there. I might come back for it. or something, but that&#39;s high level why I brought this item forward.</td>

                <td>Great. Thank you. Through the Chair, thank you for allowing me to respond. And thank you, Councilor Burnley, for sponsoring this item and highlighting this issue. The city is also keeping a close eye on this application and working with the state and the communities that are part of the URC consortium, including communities that have sanctuary city policies that are similar to City of Somerville, As you can see, the attachment that&#39;s included with the memo from law, this grant funding was something that was submitted by the state. And you&#39;ll notice in the attachment that the state has specifically reserved its right to review any terms and conditions once the award is provided to the region. So just by applying but the state is not agreeing to any terms and conditions that have been included in this new funding round. And my understanding is the idea is that we do still want to go after this funding because they allow cities like Somerville to fund crucial public safety equipments and initiative, but that simply by applying, we are not accepting funding. these new terms and conditions, and we will continue to make decisions if the region is awarded this grant. So I just wanted to clarify that. Thank you.</td>

I also do understand and recognize the need for some of those other programs. So that said, I do hope that there, like I said, there is a way to thread the needle on this.

I guess I&#39;m just going to... maybe do the opposite of uh what charlotte uh counselor kelly used to refer to as ordering ordering for the table as she was getting ready to leave uh which is just to say that i really appreciate this memo it&#39;s comprehensive and i think uh maybe clear isn&#39;t the right word for something so dense but uh it certainly makes plain the uh the situation we&#39;re in and just to make it clearer perhaps it is to say that we don&#39;t know yet what conditions may come along with this however as a secondary application the state has a chance first to say no thank you to those conditions but then when the portion that the state has directed towards Somerville comes to us we have another choice there in fact we have a couple choices which is at that time the mayor could The mayor at the time that those grants are received could decline the offer functionally from the state. And if the mayor at the time decides instead that 10% of that money going towards unsavory border enforcement spending, if the mayor decides that that&#39;s something that&#39;s okay with them, It&#39;ll then come to the Council for approval, just like all the rest of these grants. I know I can speak for myself, anticipating being on this Council for the next two years, I won&#39;t be voting to approve any grant that comes in with those kind of conditions. And I&#39;m sure plenty of my colleagues will as well. And given that we have one of our future mayors in committee tonight, I guess I&#39;d just say I have confidence and hope that it wouldn&#39;t even be something that would have to come to the council to get that. So thank you, sir. Appreciate it.</td>

Like that, you know, if you&#39;re from the public, you&#39;re wondering, well, they passed this one at the, they approved this one at the, recommended for approval at the previous city council or previous finance committee meeting and the council approved it, you know, that&#39;s because we did that due diligence with that, right? You know, Councilor Burnley was the one who pointed that out. You know, we dug in on that and we were able to ascertain that it was, we were not, bringing any of these requirements on ourselves by accepting that because it came from older tranches of the UASI funds. And that&#39;s why all this matters so much. So just want to make that point quickly. Councilor Burnley, all you.</td>

                <td>Thank you. And it dovetails with a question that I&#39;ll ask. But to that point, just really quickly, and to reiterate it, yes, the UASI grants that are before September present moment in general do not contain this language, do not contain these requirements. And I think that is very, very important for the public to understand if they know anything about this, because this is very deep in the weeds, but it really does matter. At the same time, that I appreciate the state&#39;s memo and it&#39;s, you know, intention to say that by requesting these funds, we are not saying that we agree to this language. That is premised, you know, I&#39;m not a lawyer, but I have been looking at a lot of legal stuff for the last couple of years. That&#39;s premised on the fact that there is ongoing litigation. Illinois v. FEMA is cited in this memo. If that case is decided, before or during the next funding round, and it turns out that the federal government is allowed to impose these requirements, it doesn&#39;t really matter if the state says, well, we don&#39;t agree with that. Unless they&#39;re willing to take a change in direction, their feelings on the matter are not legally binding, in my opinion. I think it&#39;s really important for folks to know that this isn&#39;t happening yet. It could happen soon, and it could happen in the next funding round of these grants. And if that does happen, the city will have decisions to make about what it means to be a sanctuary city, how best to fund the real needs of our community for public safety and for supplies. while not sacrificing our neighbors. So to get to a question, I guess, do we have a sense of when the next funding round will start for these grants?</td>

There&#39;s not a lot of news about it currently. I hope that changes. But I certainly will be keeping my eye open to make sure that If anything about this changes if we&#39;re if we are told that this is a legally enforceable requirement of these grants I certainly in any capacity that I have at the time will be bringing it to people&#39;s attention that&#39;s all for me.</td>

But it&#39;s something that I think is really important that we just keep in the back of our minds when it comes to some of these fundings. And I will also note, a little off topic, but not too far off of a field, Somerville does have a... Immigrant Legal Services Stabilization Fund, we have contracts for that currently. If I remember correctly, that contract expires next year. So there&#39;s a lot of work to be done on this front. We got to make sure that as everything is happening and chaos is unfurling in our community, that we keep our eyes on the ball and do everything we possibly can to support all of our neighbors.</td>

That&#39;s ID number 25-1344, in order by Councilman Mbah, that the Director of Finance provide a comprehensive accounting of all stabilization accounts that have remained unspent for three or more fiscal years and provide a report for each fund. We received earlier today or yesterday, yesterday I think, uh we received three i think there were three separate documents two or three uh in relation to this uh one showing the balances and others providing a bit of an explanation um i texted with counselor uh he had some A question, comment, I don&#39;t know. He had discussion. He wanted to participate. He&#39;s unable to be here tonight. You know, I appreciate this report coming in. I am inclined just to give Council Member Mbah a chance to be here to talk about this. I&#39;m inclined to keep this in committee while acknowledging that we were given what was asked, you know. no shade on the administration here that they did what was asked, but I&#39;d love Councilor Mavada to be able to be here and participate in a discussion about the report that was given.

I think it gives the public a little bit more insight into. where their money is going, where grants are being funneled to, what we have in our rainy day funds for emergencies that we could be using to better serve the public&#39;s needs. of course different funds have different purposes so this isn&#39;t just throw everything at the wall if we we want to do something fancy uh but I think it&#39;s very important to to be able to for the public and for the council to be able to know what we have on hand in the various funds um and if need be be prepared to use them uh in the case that it best serves though the needs of our constituents thanks</td>

Councillor Clingan.</td>

Just so the public watching understands, like Councillor Burnley said, these are put into creation for a bunch of different reasons, some of which come out of, say, a development... like I know Lowell street, but I don&#39;t see it on here, but I think maybe it&#39;s the max pack stabilization ward five benefit fund, but that have to be used specifically in the Lowell street, Alpine street area for traffic calming and stuff like that. So like, you know, I don&#39;t, I only see like one for like Broadway for me, you know, in my area. So I&#39;ve, I&#39;ve, I&#39;ve often, you know, voiced my jealousy and, and, and I would, if I had more in my area, I would definitely be, you know, depending on what the stipulations are, expending it, pushing for its use for improvements in the area. So it&#39;s good to have this. And like you said, it would be great to read, Mr. Chair, to you that if there was more explanation of what each one is and why they exist and how they came into existence.</td>

All right. Colleagues, anything else on this before we get totally loopy tonight? Remember, again, we&#39;re going to keep this one in committee. We can come back to this. People can spend some time with these and come back when Councilman Mbah is here with us next time. All right. With that, we&#39;re going to keep this one in committee as well, please, Clerk. So I believe Councilor Clingan has moved to adjourn. So could we please call motion? Call the roll, please. Easy for me to say. On both approval of the items laid on the table, and please read those item numbers, and Councilor Clingan&#39;s motion to adjourn.</td>
