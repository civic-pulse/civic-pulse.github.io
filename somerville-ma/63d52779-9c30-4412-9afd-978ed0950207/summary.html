<h3 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h3>
<p>The Finance Committee met to discuss various financial matters, including the approval of prior meeting minutes, acceptance of a grant for a fossil fuel-free ordinance study, approval of prior invoices, and a significant bond authorization for the Morrison Avenue Linear Storage Sewer Separation Project. The committee also addressed contract extensions for banking services and several items related to the 299 Broadway development. A key discussion revolved around new federal grant requirements concerning Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) cooperation, with the committee opting to hold these items for further discussion. The meeting concluded with a review of stabilization accounts, which was also held for future discussion.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="1-approval-of-minutes">1. Approval of Minutes</h3>
<p><strong>Item ID:</strong> 25-1443
<strong>Description:</strong> Approval of the minutes of the Finance Committee meeting of September 9th, 2025.
<strong>Discussion:</strong> No discussion.
<strong>Outcome:</strong> Laid on the table to recommend approval.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="2-grant-acceptance-fossil-fuel-free-ordinance-study">2. Grant Acceptance: Fossil Fuel-Free Ordinance Study</h3>
<p><strong>Item ID:</strong> 25-1295
<strong>Description:</strong> Request by the Mayor for approval to accept and expend a $50,000 grant with no new match required from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs to the Office of Sustainability and Environment for a study investigating possible zoning incentives to increase the ability to comply with the fossil fuel-free ordinance.
<strong>Presenter:</strong> Christine Blaze, Director of Mayor's Office of Sustainability and Environment.
<strong>Key Discussion Points:</strong>
*   The grant was originally applied for at $75,000 but awarded $50,000 after a nearly year-long state approval process.
*   A contract was entered into with VHB and Autocase in February for the study.
*   The project aims to identify methods to compel compliance with the fossil fuel-free ordinance, passed in November 2023, which is part of the city's bid to enter the state's fossil fuel-free demonstration pilot program.
*   The study will focus on reducing variance requests, particularly concerning transformers, and creating community benefits for electrification.
*   The end goal is to create recommendations for zoning amendments, supported by financial analysis, focus groups, and research with utilities.
<strong>Outcome:</strong> Laid on the table to recommend approval.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="3-police-department-items-items-3-6">3. Police Department Items (Items 3-6)</h3>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Four Police Department items were scheduled for discussion.
<strong>Discussion:</strong> Director Wisdom was unable to attend the meeting.
<strong>Outcome:</strong> Items 3-6 were held in committee for discussion at the next meeting.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="4-prior-invoices-small-dollar-figures">4. Prior Invoices (Small Dollar Figures)</h3>
<p><strong>Item IDs:</strong> 7-12 (Specific IDs not read into record, but described as small dollar figure prior invoices, triple or double figures).
<strong>Description:</strong> Approval of a batch of small dollar figure prior invoices.
<strong>Discussion:</strong> No specific questions or discussion from committee members.
<strong>Outcome:</strong> Laid on the table to recommend approval.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="5-department-of-infrastructure-and-asset-management-iam-financial-matters">5. Department of Infrastructure and Asset Management (IAM) Financial Matters</h3>
<p><strong>Item ID:</strong> 25-1410
<strong>Description:</strong> Request from the Mayor requesting approval to pay prior invoices totaling $10,452.22 using available funds in the Department of Infrastructure and Asset Management, Ordinary Maintenance Professional and Technical Account for Strategic Asset Management Plan.
<strong>Item ID:</strong> 25-1412
<strong>Description:</strong> Mayor's request for approval of a transfer of $350,048 from the Department of Infrastructure and Asset Management (IAM) Ordinary Maintenance Professional and Technical Services account to the IAM Capital Outlay Professional and Technical Services account.
<strong>Presenter:</strong> Michael Richards, Director of Finance and Administration for the Department of Infrastructure and Asset Management.
<strong>Key Discussion Points:</strong>
*   <strong>Prior Invoices (25-1410):</strong> The $10,452.22 invoice is related to the Strategic Asset Management program, an ongoing project funded through the professional and technical line. The invoice was dated June 5th and approved June 20th. This funding was previously from an Ordinary Maintenance (OM) line, which is intended for fiscal year purchases. Due to an oversight, these longitudinal studies were funded from an OM line, leading to funds being lost at fiscal year-end as they could not be moved to a stabilization fund.
*   <strong>Fund Transfer (25-1412):</strong> The request is to move $350,048 from the FY26 Ordinary Maintenance Professional and Technical account to a newly created Capital Outlay Professional and Technical line. This change will provide latitude to span fiscal years and move remaining balances on task orders into a stabilization fund, aligning with how capital and engineering projects are managed.
<strong>Outcome:</strong> Both items (25-1410 and 25-1412) were laid on the table to recommend approval.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="6-morrison-avenue-linear-storage-sewer-separation-project">6. Morrison Avenue Linear Storage Sewer Separation Project</h3>
<p><strong>Item ID:</strong> 25-1411
<strong>Description:</strong> Mayor requesting an authorization to borrow $4,300,000 in a bond and to appropriate the same amount for the design of the Morrison Avenue Linear Storage Sewer Separation Project.
<strong>Presenter:</strong> Michael Richards, Director of Finance and Administration for the Department of Infrastructure and Asset Management, and Brian Postlethwaite, Director of Engineering in the IAM department.
<strong>Key Discussion Points:</strong>
*   This is a Phase Two follow-on authorization request. $2 million was previously approved for the initial design phase (up to 30%).
*   The current request is for the 30% through final design and bid administration.
*   Of the $4.3 million, $3.8 million is for the design itself, with a $500,000 contingency for design changes or unforeseen circumstances.
*   The project is on the capital plan, submitted as part of the water and sewer rate study, and approved to begin in FY26.
*   <strong>Councilor Burnley's Question:</strong> Clarification on the term "linear storage."
    *   <strong>Director Postlethwaite's Response:</strong> The linear component refers to using a large diameter pipe, much larger than needed for flow transport, to store stormwater. This "big long line of a tank" will span roughly from Cedar Street to Grove Street, almost the full length of Morrison Avenue. The purpose is to preload and pre-store stormwater to minimize flooding in Davis Square, as there is no room for a traditional tank in Davis Square.
*   The project is a priority due to significant flooding issues in the Morrison Avenue area.
<strong>Outcome:</strong> Laid on the table to recommend approval.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="7-eastern-bank-contract-extension">7. Eastern Bank Contract Extension</h3>
<p><strong>Item ID:</strong> 25-1384
<strong>Description:</strong> Mayor requesting approval to extend and amend a contract with Eastern Bank for an additional year until August 31st, 2026, for the banking services of the Treasury Department.
<strong>Discussion:</strong> A memo from the Treasurer explained the rationale for staggering end dates. No discussion from committee members.
<strong>Outcome:</strong> Laid on the table to recommend approval.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="8-299-broadway-related-items">8. 299 Broadway Related Items</h3>
<p><strong>Item IDs:</strong> 17-20 (Specific IDs not read into record, but related to 299 Broadway).
<strong>Presenters:</strong> Brian Postlethwaite, Director of Engineering in the IAM department, and Attorney Salkert.</p>
<h4 id="81-discontinuance-of-sewell-court-portion-termination-of-easement">8.1. Discontinuance of Sewell Court Portion &amp; Termination of Easement</h4>
<p><strong>Item IDs:</strong> 17 &amp; 19 (as clarified during discussion)
<strong>Presenter:</strong> Brian Postlethwaite, Director of Engineering.
<strong>Key Discussion Points:</strong>
*   The 299 Broadway project (old Star Market site) involves a large affordable housing 40B development.
*   A legacy private way (Sewell Court) extended into the Star Market parking lot, which was vestigial and unused.
*   An old utility easement also existed for city utilities in that private way.
*   To facilitate the housing project, it was deemed necessary to discontinue a portion of Sewell Court and terminate the corresponding utility easement.
*   Neither the discontinued private way nor the terminated easement is used or has value to the city; returning it to the developer benefits the housing project.
*   <strong>Councilor Clingan's Question:</strong> Clarification on the visual impact and changes to the area, particularly regarding parking.
    *   <strong>Director Postlethwaite's Response:</strong> The discontinued portion is the hatched area on the provided map, effectively within the old Star Market parking lot. The remainder of Sewell Court will remain as is. The discontinued portion becomes part of the 299 Broadway property.
<strong>Outcome:</strong> Laid on the table to recommend approval.</p>
<h4 id="82-order-of-taking-and-easements-for-lot-3-at-299-broadway">8.2. Order of Taking and Easements for Lot 3 at 299 Broadway</h4>
<p><strong>Item IDs:</strong> 18 &amp; 20 (as clarified during discussion)
<strong>Presenter:</strong> Attorney Salkert.
<strong>Key Discussion Points:</strong>
*   <strong>Item 20 (Order of Taking):</strong> This is an order of taking for the acquisition of Lot 3 at 299 Broadway, depicted on the provided map. Lot 3 is being taken for use as a municipal parking lot and access driveway.
*   <strong>Item 18 (Easement):</strong> Lot 1 and Lot 2 will have the right to use the access driveway in common with the public via an easement.
*   A temporary easement will be granted for construction purposes (lay down and construction) until the completion of Building A and Building B or improvements on Lot 3, whichever is latest.
*   A permanent maintenance easement (Paragraph C in the document) will require the owners of Lot 1 and Lot 2 to maintain, repair, or replace improvements on Lot 3, consistent with other city easements where the city owns property but requires owners to maintain improvements.
*   <strong>Chair Wilson's Question:</strong> Noted a potential scrivener's error in the taking document regarding the gender of the City Council President.
    *   <strong>Attorney Salkert's Response:</strong> Confirmed it was a scrivener's error and would not have legal ramifications.
<strong>Outcome:</strong> Laid on the table to recommend approval.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="9-immigration-and-customs-enforcement-ice-cooperation-requirements-for-federal-grants">9. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Cooperation Requirements for Federal Grants</h3>
<p><strong>Item ID:</strong> 25-1445
<strong>Description:</strong> Order by Councilor Burnley that the City Solicitor update this Council on the new Immigration and Customs Enforcement cooperation requirements attached to the forthcoming Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI) grants.
<strong>Item ID:</strong> 25-1446
<strong>Description:</strong> Order by Councilor Burnley that the Chief of Police or the Metro Boston Homeland Security Region representative update this Council on the strategy for applying for Urban Area Security Initiative or any other federal grants that require Immigration and Customs Enforcement cooperation.
<strong>Presenter:</strong> Councilor Burnley, Director Singh.
<strong>Key Discussion Points:</strong>
*   <strong>Councilor Burnley's Rationale:</strong> Raised concerns about new requirements in UASI grants that could compel the city to take actions contrary to its sanctuary city values and laws. Highlighted the penultimate paragraph of the provided memo.
    *   The FY25 NOFO (Notice of Funding Opportunity) adds "supporting border crisis response and enforcement" as a new national priority area, requiring at least 10% of UASI funds to be allocated to it.
    *   Examples of compliant programs include:
        1.  Authorizing state and local enforcement officers to perform immigration officer functions.
        2.  Cooperating with ICE detainers.
        3.  Supporting activities like officer training, technology and information sharing, operational support, and community engagement.
    *   Expressed concern about all three options, particularly cooperating with ICE detainers, which is seen as contrary to sanctuary city laws.
    *   Noted Somerville's participation in the Boston Regional Intelligence Center (BRIC) and questioned what information Somerville shares with federal departments through BRIC.
*   <strong>Director Singh's Response:</strong>
    *   The city is closely monitoring the application and working with the state and other consortium communities with similar sanctuary city policies.
    *   The state has reserved its right to review terms and conditions once an award is provided.
    *   Simply applying does not mean accepting these new terms; decisions will be made if the region is awarded the grant.
    *   The city aims to secure funding for crucial public safety equipment and initiatives.
*   <strong>Councilor Clingan's Comment:</strong> Thanked Councilor Burnley for bringing the issue forward, expressed concern, and hoped for a way to "thread the needle" to secure funds without compromising city values.
*   <strong>Councilor Scott's Comment:</strong> Appreciated the comprehensive memo. Clarified that the state has the first opportunity to decline conditions, and if funds are then offered to Somerville, the Mayor could decline. If the Mayor accepts, the Council would then vote on the grant. Stated he would not vote to approve any grant with such conditions.
*   <strong>Councilor Burnley's Follow-up:</strong> Reiterated that current UASI grants do not contain this language. Emphasized that the state's memo relies on ongoing litigation (Illinois v. FEMA); if the federal government is allowed to impose these requirements, the state's "feelings" may not be legally binding. Stressed the importance of monitoring this for future funding rounds.
*   <strong>Councilor Burnley's Question:</strong> Asked Director Singh about the timeline for the next funding round.
    *   <strong>Director Singh's Response:</strong> Does not have details on the timeline but will follow up with Chief Benford.
*   <strong>Decision to Hold:</strong> Councilor Burnley requested to keep both items in committee to allow for updates and further discussion, especially given the evolving nature of the requirements and the city's commitment to its sanctuary city status.
<strong>Outcome:</strong> Both items (25-1445 and 25-1446) were held in committee.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="10-stabilization-accounts-accounting">10. Stabilization Accounts Accounting</h3>
<p><strong>Item ID:</strong> 25-1344
<strong>Description:</strong> Order by Councilor Mbah that the Director of Finance provide a comprehensive accounting of all stabilization accounts that have remained unspent for three or more fiscal years and provide a report for each fund.
<strong>Discussion:</strong>
*   The committee received three documents related to this request, including balances and explanations.
*   Chair Wilson noted Councilor Mbah's absence and his desire to participate in the discussion.
*   <strong>Councilor Burnley's Comment:</strong> Thanked Councilor Mbah for the request. Noted the overwhelming number of funds, some unused for nearly a decade. Expressed that the document is "hopeful" as it provides insight into public funds, grants, and "rainy day funds." Emphasized the importance of transparency and knowing what funds are available, while acknowledging different funds have different purposes.
*   <strong>Councilor Clingan's Comment:</strong> Expressed "jealousy" over some funds, noting that many are specific to certain areas or purposes (e.g., Lowell Street/Alpine Street for traffic calming). Advocated for more explanation on the purpose and origin of each fund for public understanding.
*   <strong>Decision to Hold:</strong> The committee agreed to hold the item in committee to allow Councilor Mbah to be present for the discussion.
<strong>Outcome:</strong> Item 25-1344 was held in committee.</p>
