<h4 id="b-committee-on-equity-gender-seniors-families-and-vulnerable-populations-meeting-on-may-27th-2025">B. Committee on Equity, Gender, Seniors, Families, and Vulnerable Populations (Meeting on May 27th, 2025)</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Report by:</strong> Councillor Strezo</li>
<li><strong>Key Discussion Points:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Guaranteed Basic Income (GBI):</strong> Discussion on the pilot program providing $750/month to low-income residents and concerns about the impact of its conclusion.</li>
<li><strong>Founders Rink (Item 25-0456 &amp; 25-0776):</strong><ul>
<li>Councillor Strezo expressed disappointment with the administration's "half-baked" plan for Founders Rink, stating it would negatively impact community members and she would vote no on the appropriation.</li>
<li>Councillor Davis echoed concerns, stating the administration's presentation was a "well-constructed restatement" of previous arguments to use the rink for non-ice purposes. He emphasized the rink's value as an ice facility, especially given the city's limited recreational spaces and the significant taxpayer investment. He noted the proposal to spend nearly $200,000 to effectively shutter the rink for winter was unacceptable.</li>
<li><strong>Public Comment:</strong> Olga Friedman, a Somerville resident, spoke against the plan to convert Founders Rink, advocating for its continued use as a 12-month ice rink. She highlighted the importance of such facilities for retaining families in Somerville.</li>
<li><strong>Councillor Ewen-Campen:</strong> Stated he would not vote to shut down 50% of Somerville's ice.</li>
<li><strong>Councillor Wilson:</strong> Expressed disappointment that the council's message for year-round use was not heard and that intentionally shuttering an indoor facility "boggles the mind."</li>
<li><strong>Councillor McLaughlin:</strong> While acknowledging the city's effort to address multiple youth services, he stated he would vote no. He suggested using grass turf for non-ice uses, as done historically, which is cheaper and would allow for continued ice use, noting that only pickleball would be lost.</li>
<li><strong>Councillor Burnley:</strong> Criticized the administration for repackaging the same idea and emphasized the need for more year-round recreational space.</li>
<li><strong>Councillor Sait:</strong> Apologized to parents and children for the need to advocate repeatedly for the rink.</li>
<li><strong>Councillor Clingan:</strong> Emphasized Somerville's identity as a "hockey town" and the importance of maintaining ice rinks for increasing accessibility, especially for girls' hockey.</li>
<li><strong>Councillor Mbah:</strong> Supported Councillor Davis's points and stated his no vote was for equitable access to a community resource.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Motion to Sever:</strong> Councillor Strezo moved to sever <strong>Mayor's Request 25-0456</strong> (appropriation for Founders Rink) and <strong>Officer's Communication 25-0776</strong> from the committee report.<ul>
<li><strong>Clerk's Recommendation:</strong> Sever 25-0456 for a separate vote, and mark 25-0776 as work completed upon acceptance of the committee report.</li>

<h4 id="d-water-and-sewer-rates-taken-out-of-order">D. Water and Sewer Rates (Taken Out of Order)</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Item 7.3: Request of the Mayor requesting approval of Fiscal Year 2026 Water and Sewer Rates.</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Speakers:</strong><ul>
<li>Richard Grace, Director of Infrastructure and Asset Management (IAM)</li>
<li>Neil Viner, Water Superintendent</li>
<li>Jay Hayden, Sewer Superintendent</li>
<li>Kelly Hebert, Director of Finance and Administration, Water and Sewer Department</li>
<li>Michael Mastroboni, Budget Director</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Presentation Overview:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Expenses:</strong> Rates cover water/sewer operations, maintenance, and capital investment. System is old, increasing risk and costs.</li>
<li><strong>Operations &amp; Maintenance:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Water:</strong> 130 miles of main, 1,600 fire hydrants, 16,000 services. Daily emergencies, preventative maintenance, DEP-regulated water sampling.</li>
<li><strong>Sewer:</strong> 183 miles of main, 4,800 manholes, 3,600 catch basins. Similar issues with aging infrastructure and rising costs. New hauling and disposal contract in place.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Administration &amp; Billing:</strong><ul>
<li>51,000 bills generated annually for 16,000 customer accounts.</li>
<li>Transitioning to quarterly billing (67,000 potential bills).</li>
<li>Currently 2 full-time principal clerks and 2 analysts for customer service (insufficient staffing).</li>
<li>Drivers of increased administrative needs: commercial development, new housing, condo conversions (235/year).</li>
<li>Proposed stormwater enterprise fund will increase workload.</li>
<li><strong>Accomplishments:</strong><ul>
<li>Generated over 800 fiscal tier adjustments to correct past underbilling due to faulty meters.</li>
<li>Meter replacement project over 94% complete.</li>
<li>Converted all paper meter files to electronic format.</li>
<li>Integrating with 311 Q Alert system.</li>
<li>Created a Munis utility billing manual and implemented team-based billing.</li>
<li>Instituted bi-weekly team meetings and a "Task Resolution Tracker."</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Staffing Request:</strong> 4 new FTEs (2 principal clerks, 2 managers) to support billing and customer service.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Capital Investment Plan (CIP):</strong><ul>
<li>Primary driver for future rates.</li>
<li>Guiding principles: meet regulatory requirements, improve service, mitigate flooding, reduce risk.</li>
<li><strong>Projects:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Morrison Avenue:</strong> Replaces failing pipe, provides linear storage to relieve flooding in Wards 5 &amp; 6.</li>
<li><strong>Mystic River Outfall and Sewer Separation:</strong> Alleviates flooding in Foss Park area (Ward 4), reduces combined sewer overflow (CSO) volumes at Psalm 7A by 40%, reduces spills from 8 to 3 per year.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>These projects are dependent on passing the proposed rates.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Financial Modeling (Stantec):</strong><ul>
<li>10-year model tracks revenues, expenses, fund balances, and debt service.</li>
<li><strong>Key Metrics:</strong><ul>
<li>Yearly revenues slightly above cost of service.</li>
<li>Cash on hand (reserves) above target.</li>
<li>Minimum fund balance policy met.</li>
<li>Debt service to revenue ratio around 30% (target 10% for general fund).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Expenditures:</strong> Fixed costs (debt service, MWRA assessments) make up 2/3 of water budget, 70% of sewer budget. Half of revenue goes to MWRA.</li>
<li><strong>Revenue:</strong> 95% of water operations and 97% of sewer operations funded by base and usage charges.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Impact of Previous Year's Rate Failure:</strong><ul>
<li>Last year's proposed 9.5% water / 5% sewer increase failed.</li>
<li>Resulted in dire circumstances for FY26, depleting stabilization by $1.7 million.</li>
<li>0% increase this year would lead to a 40% increase needed in FY27.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>FY26 Rate Proposal:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Water:</strong> 18% increase (makeup for last year's 9%). Keeps fund balances in line, avoids touching stabilization.</li>
<li><strong>Sewer:</strong> 12% increase. Keeps stabilization healthy, builds some cash.</li>
<li><strong>Affordability:</strong> Massachusetts law prohibits financial means-based assistance for utility charges. New director will focus on this.</li>
<li><strong>I&amp;I Fee (Item 25-1069):</strong> Increase collected from developers to fund stormwater capital projects. $8.3 million currently, projected $18 million more.</li>
<li><strong>Billing Structure Changes:</strong><ul>
<li>Align base rate scaling with industry standards (large users currently underpaying).</li>
<li>Reduce volumetric tiers from 5 to 3.</li>
<li>Shift brackets to be fairer to 2- and 3-family houses (currently penalized by single meter).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Stormwater Fee:</strong> Based on impervious area, planned for mid-year rollout (January 1, 2026). Requires new staffing and billing system work.</li>
<li><strong>Residential Impact:</strong> Net impact of 18% water / 12% sewer + structure changes means 8-12% increase for most 1-, 2-, 3-family houses. With stormwater fee, 2- and 3-family houses see bigger benefit.</li>
<li><strong>Commercial Impact:</strong> Shifts burden to larger commercial users, especially with stormwater fee. Example: Target parking lot could see 428% increase. Smaller businesses (restaurants) will see lower increases.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Quarterly Billing:</strong> Base rate will be spread over four bills, not an additional charge.</li>
<li><strong>Stormwater Fee:</strong> Not a third additional charge; it's a rebalancing of the sewer bill, with a portion allocated to stormwater based on impervious area. Smaller residential users will see a decrease in their sewer portion, leading to a net decrease in their overall bill once the stormwater fee is implemented.</li>
<li><strong>Budgeted Positions:</strong> Proposed positions are in the FY26 budget.</li>
<li><strong>Stabilization Funds:</strong> Total city stabilization is $127 million. Water and Sewer capital stabilization is $20.5 million. Using these for operations is bad practice; they are for cash-funding capital projects to avoid long-term debt.</li>
<li><strong>AI in Billing:</strong> Not currently integrated due to complexity and pitfalls in government applications.</li>
<li><strong>Long-term Rate Increases:</strong> Double-digit increases are a possibility for the foreseeable future due to ongoing infrastructure needs and MWRA costs.</li>
<li><strong>Staffing &amp; Capacity:</strong> Councillor Scott raised concerns about the reliance on contractors for water operations and the difficulty in hiring and retaining licensed city staff. He emphasized the urgency of building internal capacity and removing barriers to hiring. Director Grace acknowledged the problem and stated it's a priority for the new director to create a career ladder. Jay Hayden (Sewer Superintendent) passionately advocated for hiring workers over focusing on a director.</li>
<li><strong>Affordability:</strong> Councillor Strezo reiterated concerns about the impact of rate increases on residents with fixed incomes and the lack of a feasible affordability program.</li>
<li><strong>Non-profits:</strong> Large non-profits are subject to the same commercial rates based on utility use.</li>
<li><strong>Stormwater Fee Implementation:</strong> January 1, 2026, target due to billing system work. Educational campaign (videos, community engagement) planned.</li>

<h4 id="c-committee-on-land-use-meeting-in-joint-session-with-the-planning-board-on-june-5th-2025">C. Committee on Land Use (Meeting in joint session with the Planning Board on June 5th, 2025)</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Report by:</strong> Councillor McLaughlin</li>
<li><strong>Key Actions/Recommendations:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Introduction of Flood Insurance Rate Map Update:</strong> Public hearing closed, no testimony. Requirement from federal government.</li>
<li><strong>Revision of Definitions and Green Score Calculations of Columnar Trees:</strong> Unanimously voted to revise.</li>
<li><strong>Discharged without Recommendation:</strong> Item to allow building official to waive certain dimensional standards for means of egress (at Councillor Wilson's request to hear from Commission for Persons with Disabilities).</li>
<li><strong>Remove Conflicts with State Building Code (Net Zero Density Bonuses):</strong> Unanimously voted to remove conflicts.</li>
<li><strong>Somerville NOVA Amendments (3 items):</strong> These are citywide changes with impact on Somerville NOVA.<ul>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong> Councillor Scott expressed concern about the interaction of the underlying R&amp;D district map change with the Somerville NOVA overlay, fearing unintended consequences if the overlay falls apart. He requested delaying these items for two weeks to resolve issues.</li>
<li><strong>Director Galigani:</strong> Acknowledged no material harm in delaying. Explained the R&amp;D district was created to allow uses like Greentown Labs and The Engine to operate without being non-conforming, especially if the larger overlay fails.</li>
<li><strong>Councillor Ewen-Campen:</strong> Clarified that R&amp;D permits uses (business incubator, co-working, scientific R&amp;D, testing laboratory) not permitted in FAB.</li>
<li><strong>Councillor McLaughlin:</strong> Advocated for addressing questions immediately due to upcoming recess.</li>

<li><strong>Public Comment:</strong> Holly Simeone (SCPD Chair) stated that the current draft's clause "provided that no other compliant design solution is possible" nullifies the intent of accommodation.
