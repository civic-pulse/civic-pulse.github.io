Councillor Clingan has indicated that he is attending the School Building Facilities and Maintenance Committee meeting tonight and will be joining us as soon as they are done there. So welcome, everyone, to the first night in a series of departmental budget hearings on the proposed FY2026 budget. Thank you to the counselors who submitted questions last week for department heads to address in the memos that we&#39;re going to be looking at here tonight. Once again, to help this flow smoothly, I&#39;ll just ask that colleagues be proactive with putting a hand up if you have a question or comment, and I&#39;ll make sure to recognize you in the order that those go up. As in past years, motions for cuts or resolutions for additional funding are in order. After we finish discussing that department or division, any motions are going to get tabled until cut night, which is Wednesday, June 24th, this time around. So I&#39;ll encourage anyone also to, as in past years, if you&#39;re making one of those motions, please speak with our finance analyst, Mohamed Aden, ahead of the 24th. Before we get going, I want to call on our Director of Finance, Ed Bean, who I believe has an update for us.</td>

                <td>Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I thought it incumbent that joining me is Chief Assessor Frank Golden. I thought it would be incumbent we talk a little bit about new growth, commercial new growth. And as I presented to you back in April, The city is projecting, the assessing department is projecting about $9 million in new growth. And as you&#39;re aware, in terms of the property tax, you can raise the property tax limit by 2.5% under Proposition 2.5, plus new growth. And of course, as we know, we&#39;ve been very successful with community in generating commercial new growth over the years. This year, fiscal 2025, the new growth is $14.1 million. And as I spoke to you a few months ago, that new growth was projected to drop to $9 million. That&#39;s a $5.1 million growth. It has tremendous impact on our ability to raise revenue. So we definitely have a much tighter budget here. And the budget is pegged to the proposition two and a half limit. We have been fairly conservative in our projections over the years. And as you know, generally by June 30th, and when DOR certifies, the new growth is higher than our projections. Well, that&#39;s not the case now. The arrow is turning the other way. So I wanted to bring Frank Golden, your Chief Assessor, in front of you. It&#39;s important that you hear this. New growth projection now is $8 million, and I think we will be working hard to achieve that. So that&#39;s about $1 million less in terms of property tax revenue than we had originally projected. So I&#39;m going to just turn it over to Frank to give you a bit of an update on the commercial growth scene right now.</td>

                <td> Chairman Wilson, through you. On May 25th, our expert that&#39;s valuing our life science uses came in and it was disappointing news. The market involving six of our buildings that are roughly at 60% is depreciating faster than we can collect growth. Basically, the cap rates are going up, vacancies going up, rents are coming down. And my projected 3 to 3.5 million is looking more like 1.5 to 1.75. So half of what we were expecting probably will not be certified. There&#39;s not much we can do. It&#39;s the preliminary phase, the value period. He values them again in the fall. I don&#39;t see this market improving. All hands are on deck in the assessor&#39;s office. We&#39;re in the field until the 30th collecting everything that we can within reason. Department of Revenue standards, they do certify the growth after it&#39;s submitted. So in terms of over my tenure, we&#39;ve conservatively valued the growth in positions that it&#39;s always gone up. This year, nine is looking like eight. I won&#39;t really know until everything&#39;s collected. I&#39;m checking things many, many times over and over again, just making sure that I&#39;m capturing as much as I can. It&#39;s just unfortunate that the non-carbon life science uses aren&#39;t moving forward like we hoped. These buildings are sitting empty. We do have four healthy buildings and six that are vacant. So we&#39;re doing everything that we can to attract anyone that wants to come. But unfortunately, Cambridge is subleasing now and affecting the 2 million square feet that gets filled. And there&#39;s about 16 million square feet in our abutting towns and cities that&#39;s vacant also. So if you do the simple math, it&#39;s going to be a while before those buildings are stabilized.</td>

So there was, you know, with various departments looking at accounts and trying to cut non-described type of items within the budget. So this portends potential problems in the future. I don&#39;t know when this market is going to rebound. I&#39;m certainly concerned about the cuts being talked about in Washington, especially these attacks on the universities and science related programs and grants. That&#39;s the bulwark of the Massachusetts economy. And certainly with our life science buildings, that&#39;s that&#39;s a threat as well. So these are things that we have to take very, very seriously and think about and plan for.</td>

State aid has not been finalized yet, but the Senate budget is about $300,000 higher than the governor&#39;s budget.

So with the projection now, because the development landscape is pretty much not happening right now, we&#39;re looking at, the assessor&#39;s looking at a projection of 8 million, so that&#39;s a reduction of $6.1 million in property tax revenue. in this upcoming budget fiscal 2026.</td>

All right, I don&#39;t see anything else from colleagues on this, so I appreciate that update. We&#39;re going to now jump into our departmental budget hearings. We are going to start. It&#39;s a slightly new process this year, as folks are aware. Here&#39;s how it&#39;s going to work. I&#39;ll announce the department. They&#39;ll take their spots in the committee room. The clerk will display the departmental memo with responses to counselor questions, if there was one. And council members can then take that opportunity to ask any follow-up questions they might have to that memo or any questions that occurred to us in the moment. So, and then I&#39;ll call for any motions by the committee for that department or division. So we&#39;re going to start by taking things very slightly out of order with the Office of Sustainability and Environment going first, and then we&#39;re going to resume the normal order after that. So while they, oh, there we are. I see the OSE team right there. And Clerk, if you don&#39;t mind pulling up the, if you&#39;re able to pull up the memo from OSE and future departments as they come before us there. For the public, these are all located in a page of the budget book at SomervilleMA.gov slash budget. If you go to the FY26 proposed budget book, you&#39;ll find a page that has links to all of these. All right. I&#39;m hopeful colleagues have had a chance to read through this memo of responses to counselor questions that were submitted last week in accordance with the new setup we&#39;re trying here. So yeah, I&#39;ll open it up at this point. If committee members have any follow-up questions or new questions that they wanted to ask here, this is the time. This is Office of Sustainability and Environment before us here. I&#39;ll ask a follow-up question while I&#39;m waiting for... Any questions from colleagues? A question about SPS composting. I see back of house mentioned. So it sounds like this is going to be primarily for food waste generated by kitchens and wouldn&#39;t really be capturing food waste from students who don&#39;t eat their meals. Is that accurate, Director?</td>

                <td>Through you, Mr. Chair, yes. So the Kitchen Organic Waste Disposal Program is a It&#39;s intended to be a continuation and an expansion of a pilot program that we ran at two schools several years ago. The program was in back of the house, so it would capture food that was left on trays that the kitchen staff would then be disposing of. Um, so they have different options for bins that they can put things in and, um, it would go into the, uh, specified, uh, food waste or organic, uh, uh, bins. Uh, and, and it would be not composted, but it would, it&#39;s organic waste disposal. So there&#39;s like a slight variation on it, um, but it is taking food waste and, um, uh, and disposing of it separate from trash. And the superintendent indicated to us that he&#39;s interested in expanding it to be district wide. The reason why we wound up not implementing or sort of ramping up the program this year is because as a district wide program, it will involve numerous different types of staff. So from janitorial staff, kitchen staff to administration staff, So we really invested upfront in creating those relationships with the schools through our climate change program manager and the school&#39;s innovation specialist. And we&#39;re working with their nutrition team to hopefully get something off the ground. And we&#39;ve prorated the amount that we&#39;re requesting for FY26 to reflect the amount of time that we think it will take to ramp up the pilot program or the district-wide program.</td>

Ordinary maintenance is projected to be down for now, but it will, by the end of the year, we do anticipate encumbering about 78% of our total budget. The reason that there&#39;s sort of three big reasons why our budget is has come out, is going to come out around 78% this year. The number one reason being that the kitchen organic waste disposal program did not run this year. That was 50,000. That was in our P&amp;T line. And then we also had a fossil fuel free slash transformer zoning initiative that we were working with a consultant to do. And there are two reasons why that got started a little late. One being that we were asking the consultant community that typically does zoning work to also undertake an economic analysis and look at this issue of creating a community benefit out of oversizing transformers and asking developers to do that. And that&#39;s a question that none of them have ever been asked before is essentially the feedback that we got. So we had to do a lot of education with the consultant community to explain what we were asking for, why we were asking for it. The other reason being that we released the request for proposals around the holidays. And that is something that we definitely learned our lesson. We will not be doing that again because we did not get the, I think the volume of responses that we were hoping to get at the time. So we had some lessons learned and then some education to do, which is why we wound up not spending around, you know, 100,000 of our P&amp;T line this year. And then the third reason is actually not for P&amp;T, it&#39;s for personal services, but it&#39;s due to some vacancies. And those are sort of the three biggest things that are impacting our FY25 budget this year.</td>

Somewhat, it was kind of like somewhat surprising to me, given that the city has been working on ambitious new plans for decarbonization of buildings, new projects to prevent flooding and other resiliency, you know, and it&#39;s also, we&#39;re also, you know, like starting up composting. So one of the things I was actually curious, can all of the priority initiatives, you know, which have been, identify in climate forward, you know, be realized with no new changes in funding for the department?</td>

And that&#39;s because a couple of years ago, we made the decision as a as a department to go after as much once in a generation funding from the federal government, as well as opportunities from the state government during better economic times that we could possibly get our hands on. And as a result, over FY24 and FY25, we&#39;ve been awarded through either $0 technical assistance grants or normal grants, about $2 million worth of funding. So that&#39;s more than double our annual budget and not just in O&amp;M, that&#39;s our whole department&#39;s budget. So we&#39;ve... the result has been that the team&#39;s been working on about a dozen grants that are all still ongoing or either wrapping up on June 30th. And those range from electric vehicles to flooding and resiliency to sustainability and resiliency zoning requirements, network geothermal, electrification, Rental registry and energy efficiency for affordable housing, just to name a few so we&#39;ve certainly been been busy and most of the funding that we&#39;ve been spending is actually not coming out of our own online.</td>

And although I appreciate the distinction between that and composting, I&#39;m curious if the director, I mean, two questions in one kind of. If these programs, the pilot for the composting and the organic waste removal are planning to start concurrently, and if we&#39;re planning to try to learn anything from the high school program, which we have had experience with before for the composting program at all.</td>

                <td>Sure, through the chair. So we do have multiple composting initiatives that will be Ramping up in Somerville over the next couple years, the first one being the kitchen organic waste disposal program that we mentioned. We don&#39;t have a start date for that yet, and I think that part of the reason for that is we&#39;re still in the planning phase and eventually it will transition into the implementation, please. But we want to make sure that we get it right because we learned to your point, we learned a lot a couple of years ago from the pilot program. We want to make sure that in OSC, just generally speaking, that we don&#39;t exasperate existing crises or concerns of the community through any of our initiatives by trying to solve for resiliency or emissions mitigation. And for this particular program, the main one is the rodent control. So we want to make sure that we get this right. So we don&#39;t have a start date at this time, but we will be sure to circle back with the council when we do have a start date. The second one that I think you mentioned is the curbside composting pilot. We are currently in the contract phase that also took a little bit longer than we were expecting, but it was for the betterment of the program. I think it&#39;s going to be a great initiative. It&#39;s scheduled to run. There&#39;s going to be a couple months of a ramp up, about an 18 month run for the program itself for serving around a thousand residents. And then there&#39;ll be a ramp down period to where we do some report outs and we can make sure that we get on record what worked, what didn&#39;t work, what the best practices are. And to your point, I think that through both of those, even though one is serving public schools and one is serving individual residences, there&#39;s going to certainly be a knowledge share amongst staff and OSC staff will be involved in the implementation of both of those two.</td>

We did work with some departments that were disproportionately impacted in order to make sure that they had a continuous hiring process throughout the fiscal year so that there&#39;s not just this big dump of positions on the recruiting team all at once. But the result is the bulk of them were moved to January 1st. And then in some departments, we made a couple tactical adjustments based on where things were in the hiring process currently. So that&#39;s the short version.</td>

Right now in the budget, we are targeting at the very least two steps for positions in grades four and lower, not five and six. If I understand what you&#39;re asking, there were adjustments made that you&#39;ll remember you approved through the non-union compensation and classification study mid-year. So there will be changes from salaries for every position from fiscal 25 budget to the fiscal 26 proposed budget. On the union side, that would be because of step increases and collective bargaining settlements. On the non-union side, it would be because of the appropriation and adjustment to the classification and compensation that was done a couple months ago.</td>

                <td>Sure. So a common practice in local governments when you&#39;re doing some sort of hiring freeze or prorating of vacancies is to start with positions that are currently vacant. That&#39;s a fair way to do it for employees because you&#39;re not reducing your current workforce. That&#39;s an unfair way to do it if certain departments just so happen to have a number of vacancies at the time. So when we pulled the report on current vacancies, there was a, I think relative to the number of employees, they have a disproportionate impact in public works. When we first looked at that list, Mayor Ballantyne said, that&#39;s unacceptable. We need to keep doing these services people rely on. And what we ended up doing was work with the DPW administration team to take that list of positions and assign the highest priority ones to be hired before January 1st and put some lower priority ones after in order to make sure that they have a clear path hiring so when i say department was disproportionately impacted i&#39;m particularly talking about dpw which is why we worked with them you&#39;re going to see a lot of variation in the dpw start dates because we wanted to make sure that they have a continuous pipeline at the same time as us having a balanced budget uh thank you through the chair appreciate that clarification um</td>

DPW is a large department that is really like a collection of several departments.

We could go back and just check in on given the different things we&#39;d heard about start dates and how it just came up in our very first department. So I wanted to just go in on that. So, all right, jumping back now to the normal order that is going to mean OSP CD and specifically OSP CD administration. So while they are filling the room, could the clerk please pull up the memo from OSPCD administration? They&#39;re all ready to go. They were ready. All right.

But if I remember correctly, the actuals on the staff development line for FY25 were just above $3,500, which was similar to an FY24. I&#39;m curious why there was an increase in that line to $22,500 this year, which is six times more than what&#39;s been in the previous two years. Can we speak a little bit about that?</td>

And it&#39;s difficult whether to know in advance whether we will be, sending someone to a particular conference, whether it&#39;ll be an online opportunity, whether it can be something that is a class or written material that we get. So really we&#39;re just trying to keep the overall staff development learning, learning and development budget in pace with what the staff needs are. And we have a relatively large staff of 80 plus, give or take with some temp and other positions. And so, you know, we have a wide range of needs across the staff based on subject matter expertise. We have certified planners. We have landscape architects. We&#39;re hoping to mint a licensed engineer. So the training development and ongoing certification needs vary widely and come due at different times through the year based on the needs of the staff.</td>

And just because... the director did mention a few other lines that are, again, separate lines, such as out-of-state travel to out-of-state conferences. The out-of-state travel line is unchanged in this year, but the out-of-state conferences is about, I mean, is increased in it, despite the fact that what is being asked for there is twice, more than twice as much as what it was spent in this fiscal year or the previous fiscal year. So when I look at those lines in combination, again, I&#39;m curious. Is there some surge in hiring that we&#39;re expecting, like a significant surge that would more than quadruple these line items, or the first one, and then double the second?</td>

There was, there&#39;s only 37,000 spent. That&#39;s, uh, nearly 14% of the, of the OM allocation.

As you recall correctly, the planning effort for Union Square, or what&#39;s identified as Union Square East and the Union Square neighborhood plan, as well as an historic incentives project, were actually rolled into next fiscal year. So we did focus some work that this department did over this past fiscal year in your ward, which is how that line item was referenced in the budget. So it didn&#39;t turn our attention directly away, but we did not start the Union Square East project because it will be directly and materially impacted by the McGrath Boulevard project being carried out by MassDOT. TAB, Mark McIntyre:&#34; And we intend to do that next year to coincide with the timing of that project and engage the public, at the same time that mass dot is engaging. TAB, Mark McIntyre:&#34; That that same group of people about street design will be engaging them about the potential development along the extent of that project, so it. We thought it was prudent to not spend that money before it was appropriate and to be more fiscally responsible this year with carrying forward that request to do it next year, mainly because of the timing of the McGrath Boulevard project itself.</td>

And a lot of that comes from the professional and technical services, an extra $80,000 in professional and technical services.

I assumed the interim role on July 1st of last year, soon after the new year started and made the decision to finish work that we had already started. instead of starting another planning project. The bandwidth was focused on making sure that both assembly square neighborhood plan and the brick bottom neighborhood plan were completed. We have two efforts that were never completed, Davis Square and East Somerville, because other things where our attention was redirected towards those and we didn&#39;t wanna have that repeated in this circumstance. So I made the decision to focus our attention onto those. finishing those planning projects and not spending money to launch a new planning project before we were ready to do so. And those two projects are now wrapping up. The brick bottom plan has been adopted. The zoning is in development. The assembly square neighborhood plan is currently in front of the planning board for adoption.

I thought after the administration piece, he will be gone. So, Director Galligan, you&#39;re not going to sleep tonight. You&#39;re going to stay through the whole night. But I guess, hopefully in the future, they will be able to put, because I had to add a column on my spreadsheet. for fiscal year 25, so I can compare both salaries and OM and the percentage change on both, so I can make a lot more sense out of this stuff. And it is clear that the planning and zoning division budget lines show slightly lower salaries and slightly higher OM, resulting in just a small increase in the total. However, when I look at it, because of much weaker regional economy and real estate activity, the department will likely be processing far fewer applications for new developments. And this will actually result in much lower revenue from the fees, linkage payment, and developer contributions. So I guess, how would this lower level of activity affect the staffing needs? And also, does the OM cover contracts for planning studies or expenses for expert reviews of development applications? How is that gonna pan out?</td>

When there is a slowdown in the economy, it&#39;s a great time to have more of our time focused on long range planning rather than permitting. And it kind of waxes and wanes with the economy in that manner. When things are hot and there&#39;s a lot of buildings being proposed, it&#39;s actually much harder to do the long range planning at the level of engagement that we believe the community deserves. And when that slows down, we do have more time to lean in to that. So I actually think this will allow more time to be dedicated to the long-range planning projects that we&#39;ve included in the budget.</td>

So many people, including folks who&#39;ve been here their entire lives, frankly, don&#39;t always have the full story of Somerville. For example, where the name Tin Hills, the neighborhood in Somerville, where that name comes from, how it is relevant, to your point, to the Freedom Trail. And so I&#39;m curious to put this in a question form. how you all are thinking about how to develop that project, which areas and types of stories will be represented.</td>

And I think because of that, very easy to retread the same stories that the community has already platformed in different ways, whether it&#39;s naming intersections, naming monuments, naming portions of our community after. So I do think it is very important for us to engage the community, particularly grassroots and nonprofit stakeholders as well in that project, just so we can really talk about how history informs where we are right now, which I think is very important, and where we&#39;re trying to go as a community.

I don&#39;t see anything. Any motions on PPZ? All right. Director Bartman, thanks for coming and hanging out with us tonight. It&#39;s going to take us to housing as we continue down through OSPCD. And look at the clerk has the housing memo ready to go there. While they do some musical chairs there in the committee room, I will say thank you to the interim director for answering my questions that were in there. Appreciate that. I might have accidentally submitted one for housing that I also submitted to Office of Housing Stability. I don&#39;t know. It was late at night when I submitted a lot of these, so. I was pretty sick, so apologies if I wasted anyone&#39;s time answering a question that did not relate to their department. There we are in the committee room. All right, colleagues, questions for the housing division. I&#39;ll give folks a chance. I&#39;ll just say we talked a lot about permanent supportive housing. So I figured that was the case that we&#39;re looking outside of the inclusionary zoning affordability program. But I appreciate you confirming that for me. All right. I don&#39;t see anything from colleagues on housing. I&#39;ll give people one last opportunity here.</td>

                <td>Thank you. And perhaps that&#39;s my fault for using the word proactive because unfortunately in this instance, most of this work is reactive. I mean, by its very nature, it is reactive. And just to give folks context as we go along in this conversation, fair housing checks, what I&#39;m referring to are checks often by individuals or sometimes groups of people to units where, for example, One person will go in with an application that says, my name is John Smith. This is how much money I make, et cetera, et cetera. Check my credit, perhaps. And then they try to rent an apartment, buy a home, et cetera. Someone else, often of a different race, or maybe their income is supplemented by Section 8, will try to rent that same apartment. And then we compare and contrast to see frankly, if there might be systemic discrimination happening in certain sets of people. This is fair housing work, which I think is really, really important, partially because we know that across the nation, this issue continues despite relevant laws, both federally, statewide, and locally in our case. So as such, And because, you know, housing encompasses fair housing, I just wanted to see what resources we put toward ensuring that someone is doing these checks within Somerville. Because, of course, we&#39;re in a position to help navigate people through the system once they&#39;ve been impacted by housing discrimination in whatever form that takes. However, I think it&#39;s an additional step to then help either contract with a nonprofit that does this work, and I used to work for a nonprofit that does this work. I have no financial ties to them anymore, so that&#39;s not unethical, but I think there&#39;s an important work to be done to ensure that as our residents try to have housing stability, that they&#39;re not discriminated against on the basis of race, color, national origin, income source, et cetera, et cetera, moving forward. So of course I have some concerns there, but they&#39;re not particularly germane to cuts. So I guess I&#39;ll pause there and ponder how I can be in communication with the administration to to have more robust funding so that we can make sure that this is happening moving forward.</td>

                <td>Thank you, Chair. I want to also... equal my sentiment to the interim director for the excellent job that she&#39;s been doing since she stepped in because I sit on the Affordable Housing Trust. But I guess I&#39;m not even sure whether my question applies to housing or housing stability. But I guess this is when we submitted our budget priorities, I think I had uh made in an order for like a line item contribution to the affordable housing trust to be included in osb osbcd housing department on m budget in order to sustain its funding for affordable housing development assistance to household facing rent or mortgage areas and I want to make sure that, you know, just to be clear, like the housing division, you know, administer programs that support development for new housing and provide access to subsidies for low income housing and now will not have any changes in staff or salary levels for fiscal year 2026. And it&#39;s OM, which is actually used for planning studies and feasibility study report will be reduced from last year. So if I lump in housing stability also in this process, I don&#39;t, I mean, like if Director Schachter is there, she can just, you know, like critical. Yes, okay. And I know that there&#39;s like an extra line increase for housing stability, but I&#39;m wondering like, I don&#39;t know. So some of the money that is being distributed, like in the past, we&#39;ve noticed that both of these divisions, like Housing Stability and Housing, have had a responsibility to manage substantial funds that a city has received through multiple sources, including the Federal Community Development Block Grants, Community Preservation Act, and other federal state grants. zoning linkage payments and other developer contribution and small private grants. So these revenues and their locations are all controlled off budget because I sit on this stuff. And I&#39;m realizing that for the past, I think since 2020, the amount of this off budget revenue has been over 10 million each year and has reached, I think about $18 million in 2023. So the funds from APA that we&#39;ve also gotten, you know, show like some very strong regional economy and many new lab buildings paid in the linkage fees from these past ones. And also, the city itself always puts substantial funds of its free cash into these housing programs. So this year, I&#39;m seeing that there&#39;s actually going to be a lot of changes. But I guess, you know, how does this change in the off-budget revenue impact our ability of the department to continue its program? And I&#39;m also... wondering like does this mean that the staff of the housing department will not have very little work or are we planning to cut back like I know there&#39;s I&#39;m not I&#39;m trying to make sense but I&#39;m seeing that it&#39;s like two different it&#39;s all merges like there&#39;s housing stability there&#39;s housing but I just you know director you know Davidson if you can share some light about some of these changes you know I know I&#39;m throwing a lot but I guess would just wrap up by saying that my priority letter you know or from i submitted two months ago i suggested that we should explore whether we might be able to build into the general fund budget for new lines for funding for maintenance of our housing assistance program instead of waiting until the end of the fiscal year to see how much free cash is left over before we can actually see changes. So I think I do not see that that idea was followed because there are no such new lines in this budget. So I&#39;m wondering, like, if you think that this strategy, you know, makes sense and find that it is not feasible or efficient.</td>

                <td>I&#39;m happy to answer what I can of that question through the chair. Excuse me. The Affordable Housing Trust Fund is a separate entity per se from the city, right? And they accept ongoing applications and those applications, they do fund multiple programs that will support low income housing for people who need help with stabilization. So the Affordable Housing Trust Fund has committed committed funds to the MVP program. They&#39;ve committed funds to the TSP program. They also fund multiple housing nonprofits. They fund the Summable Homeless Coalition. They fund Just a Start. They fund CAS, all with these other funding sources to help maintain stability in their housing. In addition to that, the Affordable Housing Trust Fund also puts in money to fill the gap when there&#39;s development, housing development pieces, housing developments that are coming that needs funding. They&#39;ve got that. And going through our federal money in the housing division, which actually comes through the housing division, the housing division funds and has funded for 20 plus years is the PASS program, the Prevention and Stabilization program, and that comes through our home funds. And that is very similar to a rental subsidy. It&#39;s a time clock. I like for ease, Section 8 with a time clock. It&#39;s a two-year period to sort of get people who have falling in need of assistance for rental, keep them in place while they go back and be able to become self-sufficient again, get their job and figure out what happened. And the goal is at the end of the two years, they&#39;re able to maintain those apartments at the end. I know that there was a slight difference between the housing stability and housing division and everybody sort of kind of goes along and goes, what&#39;s the difference between the two departments, right? Very, I kind of break it down very basic. Housing Division, we&#39;re bricks and mortar. We&#39;re building the, creating the units, working with developers to bring on additional affordable units through the ordinance, the city ordinance, the zoning, as well as developers, nonprofit developers, and creating all affordable apartments. Where the Office of Housing and Stability, they&#39;re really working with the heartbeats. They&#39;re working with the people that are coming into the office that need the additional support. care, the extra hand holding to make sure that they maintain and able to maintain their housing or move into safe, affordable housing. So we&#39;re dealing, we do in the housing division, bricks and mortar, the financings and the office of housing is the heartbeats, the families and holding and maintaining.</td>

And so we&#39;ve had this historic boom of commercial space in the city. We have taken advantage of that as a community and we have set up housing linkage. And so this vast resources have been forwarded to the housing trust so that they can invest in affordable housing projects. The bad news is that that historic boom has slowed. We all see that. The good news is the way we collect that money is in three payments. The first payment is due when the building opens. The second payment is due a year after that. And the third payment is due two years after the building opens. So there&#39;s a little bit of a lag that happens. So we&#39;re still collecting more revenue and still have sizable amounts of revenue coming to the Affordable Housing Trust that they will have available to spend on projects. The other good news story is that as a community last year, we voted to increase the CPA surcharge, and that will provide us with desperately needed additional resources for all sorts of community preservation projects, including housing. So just when we need it, more housing funds are at our disposal. I hope that addresses at least a portion of your question.</td>

Like, that&#39;s like the person you have to squeeze that elbow, like, you know, because it&#39;s... Director Schechter, good to see you. I guess... I have submitted a few budget priorities and somehow what I got was that during budget season, they&#39;re working on the budget and so it will happen. One of the things that I did was that I wanted your office to calculate and present a budget proposal for sufficient funding that will enable it to continue through this fiscal year 2026 is programs of municipal flex funding you know legal assistance related to housing such services for residents facing displacement and homeless families and individuals and i have to say you know like the heavy lifting that you you do cannot i mean i want to first of all just appreciate that work it&#39;s not every day I go out there, I hear, you know, like the work the department is doing, and I myself, I keep, I don&#39;t think that a single week has passed that I haven&#39;t reached out to you for help, you know, from constituents. So I guess when I look at, you know, your office, it&#39;s been like a modest, you know, extra, you know, funds, but does this cover the additional, what is like, I know you probably sent us a memo, but I&#39;m wondering, like, does some of this money get distributed to individuals and families as assistance to prevent their displacement or help pay housing costs? And when I look at the OM line, only used for studies and office operations as well, it&#39;s been... Let me see. I guess I&#39;m just too excited, but let me see. I want to make sure that I have a very pointed... question for you here because from my standpoint, You know, the housing stability is going to have, you know, I, well, I don&#39;t want to assume, but is your department going to have any problems maintaining its programs or voucher assistance, emergency rental areas assistance to families facing displacement? Let me just, give me an overview, answer me that. And do you expect that your revenue from grants and free cash will be enough? Let me just leave it there. Director Schachter, take it away.</td>

                <td> Thank you very much to the chair and thanks, thank you, Council member for these really thoughtful questions and I honestly have really good news for this year can&#39;t promise it for every year, but for this year. We have sufficient funding. We just increased, um, we had had about $4.3 million in, in ARPA funding to do some of this rental assistance work. And then I think you may remember there was a fairly large allocation of free cash that the mayor supported and you all supported. So right now our estimate is that at present spending levels, we have sufficient rental assistance income that is sitting in the trust fund that is allocated to pass and to the homeless coalition. To meet the needs of our residents, at least at a level equal to our but we&#39;re never going to be able to pay everybody&#39;s rent in the whole city but. To meet the demand, as we have seen it, so we have that fund we have level funding of $260,000 for flex funds in our local look in another separate account. And that is a significant increase. It&#39;s the same as last year, but a significant increase from prior years. So what I could say to you, and I&#39;m really grateful to the city that funds have been put in our account to make sure we have the same access of legal assistance. I was very worried, to be honest with you, because legal assistance is so critically important. But right now, for this year, we&#39;re going to be able to maintain the same level of legal assistance protection for our residents. as we did with ARPA funding. So we have essentially absorbed the costs for legal assistance into our budget, which I&#39;m really grateful for. We also have the money combined between my local flex money and the money that is sitting in the trust fund to get us through this year. I will say we&#39;re going to, you know, we&#39;re going to continue. We&#39;ve somewhat been working on right-sizing the program. We know that we won&#39;t have the exact, no matter what we do, the exact level of funding we had under ARPA. So we&#39;re beginning the process of trying to reevaluate, you know, with still with ample resources, but a little bit, a little bit shrunk down what we&#39;ll need going forward. But right now for this fiscal year, I feel comfortable that we have a sufficient flow of both rental assistance and funds for all of my P&amp;T contracts, so housing search, community organizing, and outreach and tenant education, and the rental assistance program. So for this year, I think we&#39;re whole. We&#39;re going to have to continue to think and see as we move forward from where we are today. And you are correct that a lot of that money, both for our municipal voucher program and for this FLEX program, have come through free cash in the past. So And we had such sort of generous allocations of that free cash that we still have some of that available for this year. And for our municipal voucher program, which I think Since this is a voucher program and a program that was intended to be permanent is going to be, you know, absolutely critical to think about going forward, but we think we&#39;re okay until FY27 for our municipal voucher program. So fortunately, I don&#39;t see any risk to that program at this time. We&#39;re almost fully leased up. We have our, you know, 30 vulnerable, 29 vulnerable families that are taking advantage of this voucher program. So I feel good about where we are for this year. There&#39;s a lot of thinking to be done as we move forward.</td>

I do see also a very substantial increase in that PTS line that is attributed to the 90 Washington replanning.

So 90 Washington Street is a one-time budget request for this project. We are working towards this position of 90 Washington Street in fiscal year 26. The anticipated spend is anticipated to get us through the point where we have a negotiated agreement and timeline for payment with a development partner. So we are expecting that we will be releasing a site for disposition in the next couple of months. We will be back at the city council in the summer to talk through all the details with you about where we are. But the spending on that is definitely a one time.</td>

The, our permanent liaison has been working very much this week on getting all of our restaurants to be ready for the taste. So all the small restaurants that are participating, we have 20 new, close to 20 businesses that are going to be brand new participants in the Taste of Somerville tomorrow. And so getting them really ready for that, right? Helping them understand what it&#39;s going to look like to submit the paperwork, navigate the system and be ready for those conversations. So it&#39;s, you know, how to stay in compliance, making sure that we get folks re-signed up for their trash pickups, that they&#39;re on our trash pickup list, making sure that they know what to do on an inspection. That&#39;s really the work of our permanent liaison and our entire small business team is focused on that advocacy and understanding of what they should be doing.</td>

And there is conversation left to be had about any implementation and enforcement of that ordinance. So I want to know that which positions or which group of positions were most relevant for that within this department. Happy to know that it is a team effort, but I am quite curious.

So I guess, you know, there&#39;ve been already some layoffs, you know, in startup enterprises in biosciences and clean technology have been impacted by the removal of federal grants and contracts. and i&#39;m actually looking at your your department it shows a slightly lower salary and slightly higher om resulting in just a small increase in the totals so um it&#39;s a significant part of you know your department activity involves subcontracting and management of job skills training programs and during the past several years these programs have been paid for by linkage fees, developer contributions and upper grant money, which was channeled through the jobs creation and retention trust. So now we are seeing that this year the trust does not anticipate receiving any revenue. How does your department anticipate the ability to continue these programs?</td>

We were working with the job structure to extend that program into FY26. That&#39;s a really strong program. We&#39;re excited to close it out strong with the third cohort. Similar, we do have a grant funded position as a digital navigator that is funded also into FY26, extended through February. That is a program to do digital navigation trainings for some of the housing authority residents. So those are our direct service programs. Historically, Economic Development has not been a direct service agency. We have been a funding agency and a thought leader and partner agency trying to pull connections back together. That is really what we see for... the incoming senior planner position, the senior planner workforce development specialist position that was vacated earlier this year. As we repost that position, the focus is going to be on leveraging partnerships, really thinking about how do we work with companies that are growing, somebody like a Sublime Systems, ADA Foresight. How do we help those make the link between our training providers and those who are graduating from those trainings to the employers? and making sure that those are really strong connections so that folks leave our trainings, that job stress funds with a pathway to a job. So that&#39;s gonna be the focus of that role when we hire for that position.</td>

So in fact, the problem that happens with us in which we usually get this question every year is that the budget cycle doesn&#39;t align with our tree plantings. And we always have to carry over some funds to finish our spring tree planting. So while it looks like we haven&#39;t spent all our money on budget time, we usually do. And then the next year there was some money carried over to pay for those trees. We have always reached our goal of planting 350 trees a year, but there is a small and odd number issue there with when the budget happens and us spending the money.</td>

So on FY25, some of the those funds are effectively contributing to the tree planting of FY26 or FY24. Which direction is this moving? Should explain that little red strip, which I&#39;d be happy to hear is just a calculation error as well.</td>

Additionally, if my colleagues would just indulge me for a second, or if they have something burning, feel free to hop. Could you just speak a little bit to, this is maybe a bit further back than you were expecting to speak about. The FY24 supplies budget was dramatically different than FY25 and FY26 in terms of the actuals, I should say. You expecting that 1500 to cover the needs of the department or is that something that would be supplemented via grants?</td>

But we have a lot of people who are concerned, afraid. We have various populations that are being targeted, as you are well aware.

So we&#39;re absolutely working close with our colleagues and other departments to promote their services and their messages, whether it&#39;s their events or supporting the mayor and her advocacy as the chief advocate for the community. And we&#39;re absolutely involved in a lot of the conversations and monitoring that is happening internally as we deal with a very volatile and unpredictable environment.

And in dollars, what that translates to is roughly 25 to 30K unspent this year. A good portion of that has to do with the push of our Drupal upgrade into the coming year. When we started the year, we thought we were going to need to upgrade to Drupal 11 during this fiscal year. If you would like more details on that, Dan Moore, the director of web services and development is with us, but there were changes on the Drupal end that pushed that to us into next year. So that is part of it. And then there&#39;s just change in a number of, I mean, change, it&#39;s dollars in a number of lines. So I think we&#39;ll come out with an underspend of about 25 to 30 K.

It&#39;s still holding up remarkably well, and we don&#39;t need to upgrade it this year. We&#39;re gonna be focusing on WCAG, the ADA compliance, as well as the Drupal upgrade.

That&#39;s helpful to know just because, of course, it&#39;s not the hugest amount of money that the city has ever spent on anything, of course. Not by a long shot, but it&#39;s important for us to have a view of whether around $60,000 will just be a permanent increase so much as something like salary increase. I kind of want to stick on the theme of accessibility. Because as the director knows, her department is one that is an entry point for how constituents understand what the city is doing, what work we&#39;re engaged with, what things are coming up. And that has implications both for the visual aspects of how we communicate, but also, of course, language justice, which As I&#39;ve mentioned a few times, also includes plain language. So I guess I&#39;m curious because it is a mention as one of the goals. Is the department creating its own plain language policy? How is it moving forward to establish these standards, both within the department and across the city?</td>

In close collaboration with the language justice coordinator in SOIA, who has really led this plain language push for the department and the city, we have been working to train up all staff who create content in plain language. So last year we did both uh, purchase of training seats with a provider who offered plain language training to people across multiple departments. Um, that is why my, um, training line bumped up that, uh, so I paid for part of that. I paid for part of that. Um, and we are trying to improve our protocols or mentoring people once they go through the training. So currently. Things get produced, some things get, drafts get produced in other teams. They&#39;ve always been finished off or polished by our team, but now we work in coordination with the language justice staff and really work to go back to people who submit items to us that are not plain language to help them understand why we&#39;re making the changes. We have a ways to go. It is a shift in approach and it can be challenging at times, but we are absolutely making progress there. And when SOIA is up, they can talk to you about language access and language justice in terms of codifying that in an ordinance. But right now, yes, we&#39;re right on the money there. We are working on proving our protocols.</td>

                <td> Okay, wonderful to hear. Because, of course, just jumping off of your comments, this has been an area of growth, an area of interest from the council for a number of years. And I know that our neighbors in Cambridge, for example, have their own plain language ordinance and policies that We certainly are not copying because we don&#39;t cheat on tests, but we certainly want to make sure that we have our own standards here because plain language, I don&#39;t want to overstate it, but is an incredibly crucial part of how we make sure that the information we&#39;re putting out on its own is accessible to the broader public, but also that the translations are accurate and easy to understand. And so any version of language justice requires, I think, at the base level, some pretty standard plain language. And I&#39;ll be very interested. I&#39;ll make a note of it to talk more about the, talk more, ask more about the ordinance later on. But just briefly, while I still have the good graces of my colleagues, I also was curious I guess two things. Again, keeping on the theme of accessibility, could you just speak a little bit more about the visual aspects of the accessible communication and the standards that we&#39;re funding this year?</td>

                <td>So one of the big pushes that we have coming up in the next year, we&#39;ve already started work on this, is establishing a photo library citywide for all departments to access. We want to be sure that, so obviously graphics are very important to visual communications and cognitive access and for persons who have, not just for people who have cognitive disabilities, but really for everyone. So we do have $10,000 in the budget for graphic design. A good portion of that is intended for graphics that help explain material. as well as graphics that make better design approaches that can just make scanning a page and finding the valuable information on it easier. We have some staff who can do graphic design, but we also need to get some professional help with that. And that is absolutely very much focused on accessibility. The photo library is the other key, as I mentioned. Right now, everybody keeps their photos in their own department folders or maybe their own personal folders. We swap and share here and there. We&#39;re going to be establishing a library that everyone can access. It will be searchable. We&#39;ll have all of the credit information to make sure nobody violates anyone&#39;s requirements for photo usage. And hopefully, we&#39;ll really be pushing to make it easier for people to include visuals in their communications that they&#39;re preparing themselves and also have them ready for our staff, which I think will also help a lot with efficiency once this is in place. And we are partnering with the operations CEO&#39;s staff on this and they&#39;ve been helping us set up the architecture for that along with IT. So that&#39;ll be a step forward.</td>

As I&#39;m sure some of my colleagues may know, the visual aspects of accessibility are also incredibly important, particularly, I would say, for any digital communications. There are even softwares that work to read images for folks with different accommodation needs. I hope And I believe what I heard also means that we&#39;re considering these things moving forward in how the city is communicating with folks. And I will just know because I do think that I saw Canva mentioned under the PTS on a previous department&#39;s or maybe a future department&#39;s line as a A wee counselor who does not have graphic design staff. I&#39;ve had a few graphic designs myself. So if anybody got $10,000 that they&#39;re looking to spend, I&#39;m here for everything. I will just ask finally, of course, one of the largest communication concerns in the present moment for our community has to do with our schools. And that that can be on several different levels, but in particular, I&#39;m speaking about the construction of a feature Winter Hill School, which is referenced in one of the goals of your department. Could you just speak toward what increases are happening there in particular or what focuses your department&#39;s working on?</td>

So we&#39;ve been deeply involved initially in the crisis when we needed to keep people informed about what was happening and then keep them informed once they moved schools and keep them informed as Edgerly went through a number of projects. The phase that we&#39;re in now is we have, we are the contractor for the consultant that we brought in to work with CAG members to regroup on a new survey. Members of my team as well as IAM are working closely with CAG members and the consultants to get that survey developed as well as a plan for focus groups. Once that is complete, our entire department will be mobilizing to get out and meet people where they are in order to be sure that we get representative participation in that survey. We&#39;ll be standing at pick up and drop off. We&#39;ll be going to events. We&#39;ll be out in the community because we&#39;re not just surveying and doing focus groups for the school district, but for the community as well. This is partly about the survey and partly about making sure people know about this issue so that when we get to a debt override, that there is understanding and hopefully some support built up for that. And We partner as well with the interim communications director of regular schools and eventually when their new director comes in that individual to get updates. We were putting those out one to two times a week during the thick of the initial crisis. We have pulled back a little bit based on feedback up until around now and we&#39;re hearing again, people want that more frequently. So we&#39;ll be working with the schools on more regular updates. We also just completed design and went live with a website specifically for the project. We did this for the high school as well. And so that site is now up. We&#39;ve been maintaining one for MSBA timelines for funding for this, but this will be the home for, as this progresses, all the renderings will go there. The schematics will go there. Eventually construction images will go there. And then hopefully we&#39;ll get to the phase of video tours. So it&#39;ll be over time. Did I cover what you were hoping to understand?</td>

                <td>I think that the regular updates will continue from now on for the next six years until the targeted 2031 opening of the school. I think that the investment for our staff time is going to remain significant throughout. It was the same way with the high school with this. It&#39;s been a little more intense because of the community decision to be made. We just go straight into a project. We have engagement that we need to do that is different this time. So some of that engagement will decrease once we get through the decision about one or two schools and what location. But then other things come up that we need to make sure people can participate in. There&#39;s a lot of room for the public to engage in design and construction features and amenities in the school. So we did quite a big investment on the high school, and I expect that to continue for this process. But I think that is mostly staff time. The dollar investment that we&#39;ve been putting into this recently, I think, will wind up being time limited to part of this fiscal year and into the next for the consultant we&#39;re currently working with on engagement. I don&#39;t foresee us meeting that again, but you never know. Somerville is a community where people really wanna be heard. So we need to be open to the potential for more need. But right now I think it&#39;s for this phase. And once the decision is made that our staff can manage the engagement needs.</td>

Preparing the language access ordinance is a goal of ours for the next fiscal year. It is something that we are prioritizing, looking into. and something that we look forward to working with the council on. We are still researching and putting together kind of the first draft, which then we will work with our law department and the council on refining that. As far as the plain language trainings, yes, we are coordinating with communications. We&#39;ve been partnering with communications over the past year or two, I think. on the plain language training, so it has been a partnership from the start, and we have prepared our budget to account for splitting the cost of those trainings as it&#39;s mutually, you know, in our interest and in our wheelhouse to promote plain language across the city for accessible communications.</td>

So thank you for that. That&#39;s helpful. As I mentioned to the director of communications, this has been something that I know our newest czar, even though not the newest, but I think the newest czar, actually. is well aware of, this is something that the council has been interested in for a number of years, at least as long as I&#39;ve been on the council. And has been particularly a point of interest for Councillor Pineda-Neufeld, who I have let hold the reins, even though I was like, plain language just has to be a part of this. So I&#39;m glad to hear that. I guess I&#39;m curious... How your department plans to work with comms to make sure that this is not only a focus for you all, but that there is coordination across departments so that all of the communications for the city are at the same standard.</td>

And when we are getting, for example, translation requests for information, we&#39;re sharing it back with them. And so that there is this iterative feedback loop and we&#39;re collaborating quite a bit, coordinating on communications that are going out across the city just every day. and plain language is a key part of those conversations that we&#39;re having. And it is a huge priority for myself, for the language justice staff, for SOYA, as well as for communications in the entire department. And so this is just naturally a conversation that we&#39;re frequently collaborating on and plan to collaborate on. For example, through the plain language trainings that we&#39;ve offered staff across the city, that has been a key part Every time that we&#39;ve offered a round of training, we come together and we say, okay, let&#39;s offer another round of training. How many slots can we accommodate? And we support each other with reaching out and. assessing who&#39;s going to participate and coordinating and all of that. And as far as review of actual communications that are going out, again, that&#39;s something that we&#39;re doing on a daily basis where we might get a request for translation and we want to make sure comms has passed through this and we work together to kind of get the language where it needs to be because that is part of our review language access request is that anything that we&#39;re going to put and effort and resources into translating or providing interpretation for is already in a state in the original source communication that is accessible to the public, regardless of the language that they speak and whether that&#39;s English or another language. So this is a critical piece of the day-to-day work that we have working closely with communications.</td>

So there&#39;s been a tremendous amount of work that has gone in through this fiscal year that started last fiscal year in this regard. And we also now are fully staffed in Language Justice, which we weren&#39;t for a while. We were finding our unicorn and we found her. So she has been instrumental in allowing for us to now be able to focus the work on these trainings, on getting all of the rest of our colleagues up to speed. And there&#39;s been a lot of appetite and a lot of uptake for this. So I do want to shout out all of our departments for understanding the importance of language justice, And as you well put it, you know, inclusive of plain language, because it is not just about folks who speak other languages, but also about speaking in a way that allows for everyone, regardless of their background, to understand the information that is being provided to them.</td>

Haven&#39;t met one myself, so it might follow up around that question as well. But I did want just to note a note of gratitude to you both. for that work, particularly around those trainings across departments, because I think that&#39;s incredibly important, not only for the work that you all do, but as we&#39;ll likely talk about later with RSJ and some of the work that they&#39;re doing. At one of our most recent city council meetings, we were, I&#39;ll use I statements because I&#39;m a big believer in I statements. I was thrilled to see and a city council agenda in Braille after years of this council speaking about the necessity to include our residents and constituents who are visually impaired, who have disabilities that require them to use Braille. And plain language is also relevant there as well. And so I&#39;m very excited to see how much more support we can offer residents and how much more engagement we can have as a result of this. I have some more questions, but I&#39;m going to yield now because I&#39;ve been talking too long. So I&#39;ll let my colleagues go ahead.</td>

                <td>Through you, Mr. Chair. Thank you so much for that question. One of the things that we have prided ourselves from our very founding is on our ability to be nimble, to constantly be educating ourselves based on what our community is telling us they need and they want And this has just been a time to really test out the skills that we&#39;ve developed through the years, because we have had to remain very dynamic and very creative in ensuring that we are in fact meeting people where they are. This has at times meant that we are delivering Know Your Rights trainings in residential buildings. Um, we are ensuring that we are reaching out to folks through trusted networks when they are in need of basic services or to be connected to one of the many programs offered through the city or through local nonprofits or even through the state. Um, but a lot of it has just meant really banking on that trust that has taken us years to build with the community. being able to ensure that we are leveraging each and every leader in our community, whether that be in the form of a fellow resident, a neighbor, or whether that be another colleague in the city or some of the many nonprofits that we partner with. So this is what we&#39;ve done. And we&#39;ve also just remained curious at every step of the way on what What else do we need to do? What other new information needs to be out there? What are we hearing from residents in terms of misinformation? And how can we ensure that we clear that up? Again, using trusted channels and trusted forms of communication. So this has mainly been the approach that we&#39;ve taken. And I cannot emphasize enough how many years of experience doing this has made what we&#39;re currently doing possible. because I think that had we not had the approach that we had from our very founding, from our director Denise Taylor&#39;s vision of what this bridge that we see ourselves as for the community and the city would look like, I don&#39;t think we would have been able to face the challenges that we&#39;re facing currently in the way that we are.</td>

I already have, but I was dealing with a constituent abduction just a couple weeks ago, and I can&#39;t say enough nice things about the resources and the staff that really leapt to assist in finding that person and making sure they got health care and taken care of as best as we could. So, as always, thank you very much for that. You are indeed meeting the moment. My only question was about the ordinary maintenance. I&#39;m just shocked, given how much language access and live interpretation has been necessary, why it would be this low. I&#39;m guessing there might be a large encumbrance for outstanding services that we&#39;re waiting on to come in at the end of the year. Is that right?</td>

And that is what we expect to spend by the end of the fiscal year. And this is exactly kind of on target where we want to be because of the nature of language access services, we want to be prepared. That is our insurance. That extra 20K is our insurance in case there is some community emergency, in case knock on wood, there&#39;s a winter hill situation. Again, we need to jump into action and provide communications for something that we were not planning for and didn&#39;t expect to happen. And that is what we want that kind of emergency preparedness insurance for. Yeah, so we are pretty much going to spend exactly what we had hoped to spend and have in the fiscal year.</td>

                <td>Through the chair, thank you for the question. We&#39;ve had some challenges with grants, mainly. We&#39;ve had a grant that had to stop quite suddenly. We passed through from the feds to the state. It stopped. It was disruptive for a period of time in which it was challenged and then reversed. So fortunately that grant has been reinstated and the funds that were committed for those two years have also been reinstated into FY26. So I think that was probably the most impactful thing that we&#39;ve had thus far. We are certainly watching a lot of the other decisions that are being made at the federal level. And there is certainly a lot of uncertainty around our vaccine. the ability to bill for vaccines next year, as I&#39;m sure you know. So we&#39;ll be watching that as we move forward.</td>

Yeah, I mean, that&#39;s predominantly that those two roles work really closely, or sorry, those two offices. So our health communication officer is working really closely with our comms team and sharing resources.

I know that this council has, multiple members of this council have requested that we move forward with the establishment of a facility that can deliver many services that would normally be incorporated into an OPC without necessarily and building the capacity for expansion once we have the legal opportunity to do so. I don&#39;t see any money in your budget for moving forward on an OPC or a subset of that capability though. Am I missing it somewhere in here or is that not part of the priority for this year?</td>

So it was one of those reserve items that we removed from this year&#39;s budget. At the moment that, as you know, that project and the OPC, the legalities is on hold and there&#39;s been no further change at the state level. So having said that, though, the team continues to work on harm reduction strategies throughout the city. We&#39;ve had some exciting new developments and partnerships with VHN, Behavioral Health Network, who has recently come to Davis Square. Our teams of CORE and some of our partner agencies are connecting with them on a range of harm reduction services, from clean needles to warm handoffs for treatment at the same day. So we&#39;ve had a lot of movement there and we&#39;re excited about that partnership. We also have our Fenway, the contract through BSAS. So Fenway Health still comes through Somerville and supplies us with data on the work they&#39;re doing. We have our community health workers who are doing regular outreach and supplying harm reduction materials. And then we have, looking forward, the public health vending machines that will be implemented. And we continue to work with our partner agencies like Somerville Homeless Coalition and other agencies in town around ensuring access, harm reduction, healthcare for the homeless clinics, a range of services that will assist our community, as well as Narcan distribution. So our CHW is doing a lot of Narcan saturation. Narcan distribution within the city. And, you know, we will continue to do all of that work and continue to build on it using opiate funds, grants, and our operating budgets.</td>

I can provide you with the detailed breakdown, but they will be predominantly our public health vending machine project is coming out of those funds. It was based on focus groups and funding a number of surveys and involvement from the community. So that was one of the priorities. We also purchased the sharps containers, the sharps dual sharps kiosks will come out of that as well as some software to assist our outreach teams when they are out in the community doing work. So I can make sure to get a copy of the memo that went to the public health and safety committee this week. But yes, those funds are starting to be spent. And again, the ongoing, much of them will be used for the ongoing cost of the public health vending machines for stocking them, evaluating them, collecting the data for their utilization.</td>

                <td>Absolutely. Um, that was a direct results from the compensation study and, um, you know, historically what the staff at the Council on Aging were paid and the difference of what the compensation study found. So no new staff hires. We are completely full. Actually, the entire FY25, we&#39;ve had stable staffing and no plans to expand staffing there. amazing thank you director and um is there like any expectation that you know some funding from the feds will be lost or we&#39;re already seeing some um you know through the chair we&#39;re already seeing some effects on our seniors the main effects right now are our work on our two social workers what they&#39;re facing with outside agencies like Social Security, the Department of Transitional Assistance. Prior, just a few months ago, our social workers were able to sit with clients and call Social Security or call the Department of Transitional Assistance for food stamp benefits right in the office. And they had a dedicated line for seniors for the DTA that has since dried up. The method the social workers are using now with Social Security are calling themselves at 8.30 in the morning. They set their timer, call at 8.30. They leave a message and essentially wait four hours for a call back. They have the senior waiting at their home. And when our social workers do receive a call back, then they link in the senior. So it is... not the method of service that we would like to provide, but it is definitely a workaround. The same with our connection with the Department of Translational Assistance and doing a lot more outreach. 18% of seniors in Somerville are receiving cash assistance or food stamp benefits, which is higher than the average of the state of Massachusetts. So it&#39;s definitely Something that we are always trying to be flexible with and trying to come up with alternatives of how we can meet the needs of our seniors and then there&#39;s a lot of uncertainty, you know we receive our funding through the city, of course, but we also receive state funding. which helps to. have our exercise programs, a lot of program material and guest speakers, guest performers, and we do receive a very small grant through the federal government, a Title III transportation grant to help our seniors get directly to the center. That is very unstable right now with a hold. Typically, we begin that reapplication for the Title III grant, and that has been placed on hold right now. The application was accepted, but they are not going to be providing us with an answer soon.</td>

That participatory budgeting win for out of school time should help as noted in the memo. And it&#39;s always good to have data from a survey, right? Make sure we&#39;re making data informed decisions.

You know, just this past week alone, I&#39;ve had multiple constituents share you know, real anxiety they&#39;re going through as families about a child that, that is not going to get into the out of school time program that they were counting on. It&#39;s just leaving them scrambling already looking ahead to the fall. So I guess I, you know, I&#39;m just, I mean, I&#39;m curious how we, what, what the, I know there&#39;s been, you know, task forces and, and you know, Surveys, I&#39;m curious what we&#39;re really going to do to just change things so that we&#39;re meeting that need for people. And I want to name, this is not something that just resides in your department, director. It&#39;s a very tricky thing that, as we talk about, resides in that netherworld between schools and on the city side. But yeah, anything you can tell us here about specifics?</td>

                <td>Absolutely. So I think one of the strengths of our cross-sector team that we put together for the Out of School Time Task Force is is that we&#39;ve identified a number of levers that we can pull in order to expand the amount of care that&#39;s available in the community. So the first one is to expand the Somerville Community Schools program, which serves a large number of students. Historically, we&#39;ve only utilized the Somerville Public Schools Community Schools wait list to determine need. Through the out of school time task force survey, we were able to then have another data set to identify families where for whom registration may be a barrier. So we have a much better idea of the actual need In the city, once we discovered what the number that we&#39;re going to use for an actual need, we were able to see that Somerville already, believe it or not, is serving a higher percentage of students in out-of-school time than many other communities. That being said, we won&#39;t be happy until this is no longer an issue. It&#39;s clear that families need this. So what we&#39;ve chosen to do is explore bringing private partners into the Somerville public schools in order to assist in the slow growth of the community schools program. One of the things we wanted to balance was growth in quality to ensure that as we build this system out, we&#39;re increasing access to high quality care. That&#39;s the model that we used in early childhood and it&#39;s been very successful. We&#39;re actually recently called up by commissioner Amy Kershaw as a model community for our community preschool partnership initiative work. So we&#39;re trying to lay all of the learnings that we have from that childcare initiative onto the out of school time system. In addition to leveraging the partner programs, We&#39;re also working on having community partners, specifically piloting a community partner in the Somerville public school space to operate as a licensed program within the district. That&#39;s something that happened many years ago with the Boys and Girls Club, for those of you that may remember. So we&#39;re piloting something new to kind of mirror that opportunity. In addition to increasing access and supporting in out-of-school time registration to eliminate that kind of scramble for the families that may not know or hear about signing up early. We&#39;re working on in-person registration sessions to really get a sense of who needs this care and how we can best meet the needs of the community.</td>

                <td>Sure, I&#39;m actually glad you asked that. So in the past, we were piling just having private partners in the schools. Now, what we&#39;re working on doing is ensuring that if you get a placement, whether it&#39;s the private partner that we&#39;re working with or the summer community schools program, all programs will be running on a sliding fee scale. So that will help in the long run to make the system sustainable. We did the first round. It was a pilot. So there weren&#39;t necessarily parent fees tied to the private partner program because it was really more about building a relationship and understanding what it means to have two programs running in one school. Now with the introduction of a sliding fee scale that&#39;s applicable across some of the community schools program and the private partners, it should eventually be a self-fulfilling, self-funding model. That being said, we also don&#39;t know what the future will hold for the growth of some of the community schools program. So it gives us the opportunity to temper that growth and slowly see how we can build out a sustainable system funding-wise.</td>

                <td>It&#39;s a great question. I think that by the nature of the way public schools work and public school buildings work, there were already a lot of stressors around sharing space, sharing classrooms. And I think that by the nature of having the out-of-school time program staff, Somerville Public Schools staff, it does alleviate some of the barriers that happen in other communities where the city runs all of the out-of-school time programming inside the school building. I think having this mixed delivery model where there&#39;s community partners providing, the Somerville Public Schools owns a big chunk of it, And there&#39;s also private partners is really the way to go, not only to build out the system, but to recognize that not every program is the one size fits all. We want options for kids and families because one kid that might succeed in this program might not necessarily want another program. So I do think that it may actually create more barriers to move the large chunk of care. That being said, I&#39;m really looking forward to expanding the opportunities and partnership opportunities with recreation. in other city departments to build out the out of school time system. So I think there&#39;s room for all of us to kind of play in the same ballpark, to be honest.</td>

But just want to start with a hearty thank you for the work that you do, the way that your department has been nimble and responsive to the needs of the community, providing one of the few third spaces that we have, period, across the city. I think the work is incredibly important. It serves some of our most vulnerable residents, including children. And it&#39;s just, I think, foundational for the way that people grow and learn in our society. I know that libraries were that for me when I was young, when I was young. So I will, having started off with that, actually ask some questions, as I want to do. We&#39;ll just note that during my time on the council, I don&#39;t believe I&#39;ve ever seen this department be over budget, but that is how it appears to be on our budget book. Sometimes that&#39;s inaccurate, as we&#39;ve heard from a few departments today. So I just wanted to ask through the chair, if the director could speak to what needs require the department to go over budget in FY25.</td>

I&#39;m curious, Director, if you&#39;ve had a chance to work to ensure that the libraries would be part of capital planning in the future. The Central Library, for example, it&#39;s a wonderful space, and of course is a bit behind the West Branch, for example, in terms of how modernized it is. Do we see potential renovations for that in the next five years?</td>

Um, there are opportunities, um, for future funding, um, or partially through the state, um, through their mass board of library commissioners building construction grants. So that could be identified as an opportunity down the road, but I&#39;m also mindful as I&#39;m sure everybody here is of the state of all of our municipal buildings and, and where all the needs are just across the city. But yeah, it&#39;s definitely a hope and dream of mine. At a minimum, I think it would be wonderful if we could make some improvements even to tide us over until there&#39;s time for a significant renovation.</td>

Libraries have a kind of relatively unique relationship between the facilities and the ability to provide services and to put forward the materials they need. I want to ask a question that I&#39;ve been asking a number of departments throughout the day, which is how the hiring freeze may be impacting this department.

The library has held so many different services and, you know, as Councilor Inbaugh mentioned earlier, if I was going to make a motion, it would be to increase the funding here because it&#39;s that important.

I really appreciate, you know, your leadership through these trying times. I myself, I&#39;m an avid user of the library. I taught citizenship classes, you know, there. It was such joy, but looking at the library itself, they said, oh boy, there&#39;s a lot of work that needs to, you know, go there. I guess we can see, like the good counselor said, there&#39;s like a few million sitting in stabilization accounts, you know, unutilized. So figure out how this money can be consolidated and used appropriately, you know, in due time as we have this conversation moving forward. Um, one thing that I have to ask is, to what extent do the borderlines, you know, reflect the response to the discipline problems at the library during the past year?</td>

I just had a question. I know you&#39;re taking the reins there and had some turnover, so I understand setting the direction for the department here takes some time. One thing that I had a question about after... scratching my noodle a little bit, was about the RSJ fund. For folks in the public, they know that it was set up back in 2020 with $750,000 in it, and it&#39;s largely sat untouched. I noticed it was in your goals to find better ways to deploy that in the community and let community members know that it&#39;s there to be accessed. But I also read in there that it&#39;s being used to fund three different positions. It was used to fund a PS, public safety for all staff member last year. And then we&#39;ll continue to fund that one as well as funding two rental assistance positions in HHS. I guess my question is, is that the only expenditures that&#39;s been made out of the RSJ fund to this date? And where is that fund at in terms of balance right now?</td>

So my calculations for the RHA fund to date is at $1,115,615. To the question about other expenditures through the fund, that is correct. Right now we are looking to fund the Public Safety for All Project Manager. and the two positions with the Office of Housing Stability. All three positions relate back to that overall mission with the RHA fund that&#39;s really focused on an enduring source to really dismantle systemic racism and social inequities. For this coming fiscal year, you&#39;ll see in Goal 3 that our focus is to really get some of these funds out and deployed to community members directly.</td>

So my understanding is that one of those main recommendations was focused on the community affairs units. So I know that there has been traction since the report has been released, but I think that PD might be, or police would be best suited to provide some more updates as to where they stand on the staffing and operations report.</td>

Another way to read it could be downsizing in some respects. We&#39;ll see how that rolls out. Not quite seeing that in this particular budget, but we&#39;ll see which recommendations actually are moving forward and which are not. But more to RSJ specifically, I&#39;m curious about a number of things. I did reference, I guess I&#39;ll start where I ended in a previous conversation with a different department talking about the Brailler. One of my favorite things to bring up, it seems that it&#39;s finally in use from the city side and that we are no longer using an outside Brailler through lease Through the chair, could the director just confirm whether we&#39;re still essentially using a third party brailler for services other than the in-house one?</td>

There are some instances where we are outsourcing for embossing that is followed up on the training that we receive, that there may be some more complicated factors to embossing that currently we do not have staff capacity who are familiar and fluent in being able to read Braille. So for those more complex projects, we do outsource. What I can say is that our team has been prepared to pilot right now with agendas and meeting minutes. I know that folks are familiar with that in the room that we had previously, I believe it was last month, piloted with embossing agendas for the city council meeting. We have been working with the Super Commission for Persons with Disabilities to emboss their agendas for their meetings this month as well. So I think with time, we will continue to build on that capacity to make sure that accuracy is at the forefront in embossing. We look forward to the opportunity to have those more complex projects, whether that&#39;s because there are images that are included that we don&#39;t have the training on yet, but continuing to build that capacity. I believe to date we have about four folks on our team who are fluent in being able to print that. So that was a priority for us this year.</td>

I noticed that in your professional and technical services line, mediation is mentioned and that your department is exploring uses of, using, why can&#39;t I say this right? the usage of mediation in the community.

We are pretty ecstatic to jump into the possibilities of what mediation opportunities can look like in the community. This year, we really focused on some of those building community capacity and common measures in the community. So we had training active bystanders, trainings. We&#39;ve also pioneered the Neighbors Talking to Neighbors program, which is focused on conversations across differences that folks have. This year, we&#39;re really hoping to train folks in mediation, ideally bringing in some of our commissioners on this endeavor, as we&#39;ve seen that that has been an area of interest in the past. at each step of the way for the programming that we deployed in FY25. We have been building on those metrics. We have gained feedback from the community that folks are looking to take things the next step. And it seems appropriate that offering an opportunity to train folks in mediation is a measure that would best serve our small constituents right now. So we&#39;re hoping to explore that opportunity probably most directly first with our commissioners, through the Human Rights Commission probably most closely, and then expanding beyond that.</td>

Just to expand on that a bit more, there are, of course, practitioners who have focus in restorative justice, for example, who use mediation to help bring together folks who&#39;ve experienced harm from each other. That can be because of hate bias incidents, as it&#39;s referenced under the RSJ set of goals, or any other set of kind of harm, interpersonal harms that could be entirely without bias, although what is without bias in our society today. Were you envisioning these would be in-person mediations, virtual, and if in-person, any any contingencies for ensuring that escalations do not happen.</td>

                <td>Thank you for that question. And I think what I&#39;m gathering at the heart of that is prioritizing safety, both physical, mental, psychological, um for folks in attendance for all of the events that we have including but especially things around mediation or talking around topics that can be particularly polarizing um or you know evoke a lot of different feelings so i can say even within this fiscal year we&#39;ve had plans for events to be in person and then hearing back from community members that we might have been expressed concern about safety, we might have pivoted to a virtual offering for those. So for the question around do we envision mediation, having in-person or virtual, I think we would endeavor to have opportunities for both, recognizing that there are different sectors of our community who serve both by in-person and others who feel more comfortable in a virtual setting and reach the most people. So that would probably be our main goal there. But I would say for our in-person events in alignment with a lot of our other fellow city departments, things such as registration in advance, if this is a virtual event or an in-person event, I think that allows for a bit of accountability, folks who are a little bit more comfortable and safe Something else that is important for us is always that ground setting at the onset of an event or an opportunity and making sure that there is a shared understanding of the shared goals, but also the enforcement of those goals within the group and those who are in attendance, that everyone should have that agency to address those needs. But I do appreciate that question given the current state of where we are and not that this is new, but it is certainly heightened for all folks and we will continue to meet that need and take back the feedback that we&#39;re getting from folks in community about what makes them feel safe to show up as their whole selves in these spaces.</td>

The goal is to be September 1st, and I can say that RSJ, in partnership with HR, is working pretty close together to ensure that that happens so that we can continue with operations as we had previously. In the interim, you can imagine that has changed a little bit of our workload, but I would say that folks on the team have been stepping up and appreciate the grace that everyone&#39;s been giving each other in the meantime. Part of that is obviously allowing for time for adequate scheduling of interviews, multiple rounds for folks, but I can let the council know that we are planning to have a pretty aggressive advanced and aggressive efforts to make sure that we get someone in place for that September 1st date. To speak to the other portions of the hiring fees impacting us, you&#39;ll see that our commissions coordinator role has been pushed for a January 1 date, and that is the latest of the three. Our RHA coordinator position, we&#39;re aiming to have a July 1st date. I&#39;m excited to be kind of closing off those interviews there to bring someone in Um, for the commission&#39;s coordinator role, again, shout out to my current team and the work that they have been doing. Um, and we talk about keeping staff and making sure that we have equitable division of work that has been a priority for us. So prior to the hiring freeze being announced, we had already started cross training, um, so that we can have some continuity with support for our commissions, um, so that they have, you know, a point person that they are familiar with, and it&#39;s not a different person per se every month. But this is also something that will serve us well when we do have a commission&#39;s coordinator in the event that someone is out of office, that it doesn&#39;t completely derail the commission meetings as we move forward. So I think while the hiring freeze has that January 1st date for our commission&#39;s coordinator position, I think that we&#39;ve put a good plan in place in the interim to cross-chain, ensure that folks are not feeling that burden completely on their own, and to also hear, heed the needs that we&#39;ve heard from our commissioners to have that consistency report that they are receiving from RHSAP.</td>

We also anticipate putting out, and I&#39;ll let you talk to, the report, but initially also intend to put out a first draft of kind of the focus areas dashboard, which is basically like a high level like progress report that the city towards accomplishing the goals in summer vision and other high level sort of strategic plans.

So our second phase, which is interns who would start in January are subject to the hiring freeze. So they&#39;re actually would start in January one and are part of that conversation. It&#39;s just that they&#39;re differently funded than permanent staff. is so if that comes to pass as it is, then the impact should be fairly minimal. It&#39;s a manageable kind of reduction for the six month period that we would be impacted. I think if we would just basically have to plan a little bit more and coordinate more with the departments that we&#39;re assisting so we can have a little bit less kind of availability for them. So we would have to plan out their work with a little bit more structure, I think is the impact for now. However, we would really talk about reinstating that funding in the long term because interns are a huge part of how we do our work, how we brought a lot of our work in-house in the last couple of years. And we really want to continue being able to do that.</td>

So they kind of enable us to do all the planning and also keep up with our operational sort of work and hopefully learn in the process. And secondly, and also critically importantly, to serve as a talent pipeline for our staff. So last year, when one of our analysts left for another role, we held a hiring process and our best candidate was our prior intern And so that is, I think we didn&#39;t have to train them, right? So like that&#39;s the value for us in the long term. So we both benefit from what they do now and kind of have a pipeline for the future. For a recent example, if you want to take a look at our Somerville at a glance page, it was recently revamped by one of our current co-ops and we&#39;re really proud of what she&#39;s done.</td>
