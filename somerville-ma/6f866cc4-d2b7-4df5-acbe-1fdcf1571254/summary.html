<p><strong>Executive Summary:</strong>
The Finance Committee convened for its first departmental budget hearing on the proposed FY2026 budget. A significant portion of the meeting was dedicated to an update on the city's new growth projections, which have been revised downward due to a downturn in the life sciences market, impacting anticipated property tax revenue. Departmental budget hearings commenced with the Office of Sustainability and Environment, followed by various divisions within the Office of Strategic Planning and Community Development (OSPCD), Communications and Community Engagement (CCE), Health and Human Services (HHS), and concluding with SomerStat. Key discussions included the impact of reduced new growth on the budget, the status of various city initiatives such as composting programs and the Winter Hill School project, and the implications of a city-wide hiring freeze on departmental staffing.</p>

<h3 id="fy2026-budget-overview-and-new-growth-update">FY2026 Budget Overview and New Growth Update</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Councilor Wilson</strong> welcomed attendees to the first night of departmental budget hearings.</li>
<li><strong>Process:</strong> Department heads would address pre-submitted questions, followed by committee questions. Motions for cuts or additional funding would be tabled until "cut night" on June 24th.</li>
<li><strong>Director of Finance Ed Bean</strong> provided an update on new growth, joined by <strong>Chief Assessor Frank Golden</strong>.<ul>
<li><strong>FY2025 New Growth:</strong> $14.1 million.</li>
<li><strong>Initial FY2026 Projection:</strong> $9 million.</li>
<li><strong>Revised FY2026 Projection:</strong> $8 million, a reduction of $1 million from the initial projection and $6.1 million from FY2025.</li>
<li><strong>Impact:</strong> This reduction significantly tightens the budget, which is pegged to the Proposition 2.5 limit.</li>
<li><strong>Chief Assessor Frank Golden</strong> elaborated on the commercial new growth downturn:<ul>
<li>Life science market depreciation: Cap rates increasing, vacancies increasing, rents decreasing.</li>
<li>Projected life science new growth reduced from $3-3.5 million to $1.5-1.75 million.</li>
<li>Six out of ten life science buildings are approximately 60% vacant.</li>
<li>The market is not expected to improve soon, with significant vacant square footage in Somerville and abutting communities.</li>
<li>The Assessor's office is working to capture all possible growth, but the overall trend is downward.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Mbah</strong> asked about the impact on departmental programs.<ul>
<li><strong>Director Bean</strong> stated that departments had to scrutinize budgets and cut non-essential items. He expressed concern about future impacts, particularly regarding potential federal cuts to university and science programs.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Mbah</strong> inquired about anticipated cuts in off-budget funding.</li>
<li><strong>Director Bean</strong> explained that the $1 million revenue shortfall was addressed by scrutinizing the budget and attempting to increase other revenue accounts. State aid is not yet finalized, but the Senate budget is $300,000 higher than the Governor's.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Wilson</strong> asked for clarification on new growth and fiscal year impact.<ul>
<li><strong>Director Bean</strong> confirmed that the $14.1 million new growth was for FY2025, and the $8 million projection is for FY2026, representing a $6.1 million reduction in property tax revenue for the upcoming budget.</li>
<li><strong>Director Bean</strong> noted that the Department of Revenue (DOR) certifies values, and the final number will be known in August.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Director Mastroboni</strong> clarified that the budget as presented is based on the $8 million new growth projection.</li>

<h4 id="office-of-sustainability-and-environment-ose">Office of Sustainability and Environment (OSE)</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Department:</strong> Office of Sustainability and Environment</li>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Councilor Wilson</strong> inquired about the Somerville Public Schools (SPS) composting program, noting it focuses on "back of house" food waste.</li>
<li><strong>Director</strong> confirmed it's an expansion of a pilot program, capturing food waste from kitchen staff. It's organic waste disposal, not composting, and aims to be district-wide. Implementation was delayed to ensure proper coordination with various school staff and address rodent control concerns.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Wilson</strong> asked if OSE was working with "rat people" (Environmental Health).</li>
<li><strong>Director</strong> confirmed they do not undertake composting initiatives without consulting Environmental Health.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Scott</strong> noted a significant underspend in OSE's Ordinary Maintenance (OM) budget for FY2025 compared to historical levels.</li>
<li><strong>Director</strong> explained that OM is projected to reach 78% by year-end due to:<ol>
<li>The Kitchen Organic Waste Disposal Program not running ($50,000).</li>
<li>Delays in a fossil fuel-free/transformer zoning initiative due to consultant education and RFP timing ($100,000).</li>
<li>Staff vacancies (impacting personal services, not OM).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Mbah</strong> questioned if priority initiatives in "Climate Forward" could be realized with no new funding changes.</li>
<li><strong>Director</strong> stated that OSE's budget only tells part of the story, as they secured approximately $2 million in federal and state grants for FY2024 and FY2025, more than doubling their annual budget. These grants fund various initiatives from EVs to resiliency zoning.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Mbah</strong> asked if any large grants were in jeopardy.</li>
<li><strong>Director</strong> replied, "not at this time."</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Burnley</strong> asked about the concurrent start of the kitchen organic waste disposal and curbside composting pilots.</li>
<li><strong>Director</strong> explained the kitchen program has no start date yet, as they are ensuring proper implementation, especially regarding rodent control. The curbside composting pilot is in the contract phase, with a start date forthcoming in FY2026, and will run for about 18 months for 1,000 residents. Both programs will involve knowledge sharing between staff.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Burnley</strong> inquired if the Residential Decarbonization Program Manager position's October 1st start date was impacted by the hiring freeze.</li>
<li><strong>Director</strong> stated it was standard practice to prorate positions not yet posted, not a direct impact of the hiring freeze.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Mbah</strong> sought clarification on the curbside composting pilot's start date, noting funds were appropriated in FY2025.</li>
<li><strong>Director</strong> clarified that the $350,000 for the pilot is from a fund outside the annual budgeting process, not tied to a specific fiscal year, allowing for a flexible start once contracting is complete.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Burnley</strong> asked for clarification on "exacerbate existing crises."</li>
<li><strong>Director</strong> clarified this referred to rodent issues, emphasizing the need for fail-safes in composting programs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Motions:</strong> No motions were made.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="budget-director-ed-mastroboni-hiring-freeze-clarification">Budget Director Ed Mastroboni (Hiring Freeze Clarification)</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Councilor Wilson</strong> asked about the January 1st start date in the budget book as an indicator of positions impacted by the hiring freeze.</li>
<li><strong>Director Mastroboni</strong> confirmed that the bulk of impacted positions have a January 1st start date. Some departments had tactical adjustments to ensure continuous hiring, particularly for critical roles.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Scott</strong> asked if department head salaries were frozen from the level set by the classification study.</li>
<li><strong>Director Mastroboni</strong> confirmed, "Yes."</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Burnley</strong> asked which departments were disproportionately impacted by the hiring freeze.</li>
<li><strong>Director Mastroboni</strong> identified the Department of Public Works (DPW) as having a disproportionate number of vacancies. The Mayor intervened to prioritize high-priority DPW positions for hiring before January 1st, leading to varied start dates within DPW.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Burnley</strong> asked if Inspectional Services Department (ISD) was similarly impacted.</li>
<li><strong>Director Mastroboni</strong> stated ISD has "either zero or one vacancy," so it would not be significantly impacted.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="office-of-strategic-planning-and-community-development-ospcd-administration">Office of Strategic Planning and Community Development (OSPCD) - Administration</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Department:</strong> OSPCD Administration</li>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Councilor Burnley</strong> noted a significant increase in the Staff Development line for FY2026 ($22,500) compared to previous years ($3,500).</li>
<li><strong>Director</strong> explained that this line, along with in-state/out-of-state conference and travel lines, covers staff training and development for a large staff (80+). The increase aims to keep pace with staff needs and certifications. He acknowledged that the budget could be more precise in allocating these funds.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Scott</strong> asked about the underspend in OM for FY2025.</li>
<li><strong>Director</strong> stated that by year-end, 57% of the OM budget would be spent. He explained that the Union Square East project was delayed to align with MassDOT's McGrath Boulevard project, and resources were redirected to other projects like the Central Broadway zoning study, cannabis retailer saturation study, and 90 Washington Street.</li>
<li><strong>Director Gallaghani</strong> added that the department focused significant staff time on the Central Somerville Ave project and completing the Brickbottom Small Neighborhood Area Plan.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Scott</strong> asked about structural changes in the department to support the increased OM budget for FY2026.</li>
<li><strong>Director</strong> cited the change in leadership (his interim role) and a decision to prioritize completing existing projects (Assembly Square and Brickbottom neighborhood plans) before launching new ones. With these projects wrapping up, staff can now focus on proposed FY2026 projects.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Scott</strong> asked about the timeline for the McGrath Boulevard area plan.</li>
<li><strong>Director</strong> stated an RFP for a consultant would take a few months, with background research and consultant selection by fall, and project launch thereafter.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Wilson</strong> asked if the Central Somerville Ave project was resource-intensive for the department.</li>
<li><strong>Director</strong> confirmed it was, requiring significant staff resources and impacting other planned work.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Mbah</strong> asked about the impact of a weaker regional economy on staffing needs and if OM covers planning studies/expert reviews.</li>
<li><strong>Director</strong> explained that a slowdown in development allows staff to focus more on long-range planning, which is difficult during boom times. Permit fees go to the general fund, not directly to the department, so there's no direct link between permit numbers and staffing.</li>

<h4 id="ospcd-planning-preservation-and-zoning-ppz">OSPCD - Planning, Preservation, and Zoning (PPZ)</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Department:</strong> OSPCD Planning, Preservation, and Zoning</li>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong> (This section was covered under OSPCD Administration in the transcript, but the agenda item was PPZ. The content has been moved here for clarity based on the agenda structure.)<ul>
<li><strong>Councilor Scott</strong> noted a significant underspend in OM for FY2025 compared to historical levels.</li>
<li><strong>Director</strong> stated that by year-end, 57% of the OM budget would be spent. He explained that the Union Square East project was delayed to align with MassDOT's McGrath Boulevard project, and resources were redirected to other projects like the Central Broadway zoning study, cannabis retailer saturation study, and 90 Washington Street.</li>

<li><strong>Councilor Scott</strong> asked about the timeline for the McGrath Boulevard area plan.</li>
<li><strong>Director</strong> stated an RFP for a consultant would take a few months, with background research and consultant selection by fall, and project launch thereafter.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Wilson</strong> asked if the Central Somerville Ave project was resource-intensive for the department.</li>

<li><strong>Councilor Mbah</strong> asked about the impact of a weaker regional economy on staffing needs and if OM covers planning studies/expert reviews.</li>
<li><strong>Director</strong> explained that a slowdown in development allows staff to focus more on long-range planning, which is difficult during boom times. Permit fees go to the general fund, not directly to the department, so there's no direct link between permit numbers and staffing.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Burnley</strong> inquired about the "cultural heritage plan" mentioned in the budget.</li>
<li><strong>Director</strong> clarified it's distinct from the Arts Council's cultural project. It aims to reuse historic buildings for housing/economic development, highlight Somerville's history, and potentially leverage it for tourism. The department is in the early stages, scoping the project with a consultant.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Motions:</strong> No motions were made.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="ospcd-housing">OSPCD - Housing</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Department:</strong> OSPCD Housing</li>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Councilor Burnley</strong> asked how the department ensures fair housing checks and compliance.</li>
<li><strong>Interim Director Luisa Boverini</strong> explained that the department primarily educates residents on their rights through outreach and tabling. For complaints, they work with the caller, contact the property manager, inform them of fair housing laws, and assist with filing complaints with MCAD or HUD if needed. They partner with Suffolk Law's Fair Housing Clinic for testing, which is reactive rather than proactive.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Wilson</strong> asked about the vacant Inclusionary and Fair Housing Program Specialist position.</li>
<li><strong>Interim Director Boverini</strong> clarified that the Fair Housing liaison position is filled, and the Inclusionary and Fair Housing Program Specialist position, though listed as vacant, has been filled since the publication of Appendix B.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Mbah</strong> asked about the impact of reduced off-budget revenue (linkage fees, developer contributions) on housing programs and staffing.</li>
<li><strong>Interim Director Boverini</strong> explained the distinction between the Housing Division ("bricks and mortar" – creating units, working with developers) and the Office of Housing Stability ("heartbeats" – supporting individuals). The Housing Division administers federal funds (e.g., HOME funds for the PASS program, a two-year rental subsidy).</li>
<li><strong>Director Gallaghani</strong> added that while the commercial boom has slowed, the city still collects significant linkage fees in three payments, providing a lag in revenue. The increased CPA surcharge will also provide additional resources for housing projects.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Motions:</strong> No motions were made.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="ospcd-housing-stability-ohs">OSPCD - Housing Stability (OHS)</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Department:</strong> OSPCD Housing Stability</li>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Councilor Mbah</strong> asked if the department's modest budget increase was sufficient to maintain programs like municipal flex funding, legal assistance, and rental assistance, and if grant/free cash revenue would be enough.</li>
<li><strong>Director Schachter</strong> reported that OHS has sufficient funding for the current year. They received $4.3 million in ARPA funding and a large free cash allocation. They have sufficient rental assistance income in the trust fund for PASS and the homeless coalition.</li>
<li><strong>Director Schachter</strong> confirmed level funding of $260,000 for flex funds. Legal assistance costs have been absorbed into the budget, maintaining the same level of protection as with ARPA funding.</li>
<li><strong>Director Schachter</strong> stated they are "whole" for this fiscal year, with municipal voucher program funding secure until FY2027.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Motions:</strong> No motions were made.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="ospcd-economic-development">OSPCD - Economic Development</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Department:</strong> OSPCD Economic Development</li>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Councilor Scott</strong> noted an OM underspend for FY2025 and inquired about the Professional and Technical Services (PTS) priorities, particularly the substantial increase for 90 Washington Street replanning.</li>
<li><strong>Director Karmi</strong> explained that 90 Washington Street is a one-time budget request for FY2026 to facilitate the disposition of the site and negotiate an agreement with a development partner.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Burnley</strong> asked if the Workforce Development Planner position (liaison to the Wage Shift Advisory Committee) was included in the FY2026 budget and if it would be impacted by the hiring freeze.</li>
<li><strong>Director Karmi</strong> confirmed the position is in the budget, and the goal is an October 1st start date, not January.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Burnley</strong> asked which positions focus on communication and coordination with small businesses.</li>
<li><strong>Director Karmi</strong> identified the Senior Planner (Minority and Women-Owned Businesses support), the Permitting Liaison, and one of the Economic Development Planner positions as forming a three-person team focused on small business engagement and advocacy.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Mbah</strong> asked about the impact of reduced revenue from linkage fees and developer contributions on job skills training programs, noting the Job Creation and Retention Trust anticipates no revenue this year.</li>
<li><strong>Director Karmi</strong> stated they are at an "inflection point." They will continue the post-secondary program for a third cohort and a digital navigator position (grant-funded). The focus for the incoming Senior Planner position will be on leveraging partnerships to connect training providers with employers.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="ospcd-public-space-and-urban-forestry-psuf">OSPCD - Public Space and Urban Forestry (PSUF)</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Department:</strong> OSPCD Public Space and Urban Forestry</li>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Councilor Scott</strong> commended the department for exceeding its historical five-year average in OM spending, indicating good management.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Mbah</strong> asked about the impact of new CPA revenue from the approved surtax increase.</li>
<li><strong>Director Lewis</strong> stated that CPA funds are allocated based on departmental and community requests. While additional funds are dedicated to open space, specific requests for the next funding round are not yet determined. CPA funds often leverage other grants.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Mbah</strong> asked about anticipated funding for open space acquisition.</li>
<li><strong>Director Lewis</strong> mentioned the CPA acquisition fund and private development as main sources for new acreage.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Burnley</strong> asked about the PTS line being over budget in FY2025.</li>
<li><strong>Director Lewis</strong> explained that the budget cycle doesn't align with tree plantings, requiring funds to be carried over from the previous fiscal year to finish spring plantings. This appears as an overspend but is a timing issue.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Burnley</strong> asked if the FY2026 supplies budget ($1,500) was sufficient.</li>
<li><strong>Director Lewis</strong> confirmed it was expected to cover anticipated needs.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<h3 id="communications-and-community-engagement-cce">Communications and Community Engagement (CCE)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Department:</strong> Communications and Community Engagement</li>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Councilor Mbah</strong> asked about the impact of federal policy changes and increased community outreach needs.</li>
<li><strong>Director Taylor</strong> confirmed significant impacts due to the volatile environment, with increased inquiries about city services and support, particularly from targeted populations. CCE works closely with other departments to promote services and address misinformation.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Scott</strong> noted CCE's OM underspend for FY2025.</li>
<li><strong>Director Taylor</strong> stated that CCE is currently at 88% expended/encumbered and expects to reach 89-90% by year-end, with an underspend of $25-30K. A portion of this is due to the Drupal upgrade being pushed to next year.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Burnley</strong> asked if the $60,000 for content accessibility guidelines (WCAG/ADA compliance) would be recurring.</li>
<li><strong>Director Taylor</strong> stated these are one-time expenses. She noted that a full website overhaul would be needed in future years if funds are available.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Burnley</strong> inquired about the department's plain language policy and standards.</li>
<li><strong>Director Taylor</strong> explained that in collaboration with the SomerViva language justice coordinator, CCE trains staff in plain language, mentors them, and works to improve protocols for reviewing content.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Burnley</strong> asked about visual aspects of accessible communication.</li>
<li><strong>Director Taylor</strong> mentioned establishing a city-wide photo library and allocating $10,000 for graphic design focused on accessibility and clear communication.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Burnley</strong> asked about CCE's focus on the Winter Hill School project.</li>
<li><strong>Director Taylor</strong> detailed CCE's deep involvement in communications since the concrete fell, including developing a new survey and focus groups with CAG members, mobilizing for community outreach, and creating a dedicated website (SomervilleMA.gov/newPK28). She expects regular updates and significant staff time investment for the next six years.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Department:</strong> City TV</li>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Councilor Burnley</strong> asked if City TV was the correct department to address closed captioning for City Council meetings.</li>
<li><strong>Director DiCarlo</strong> clarified that the City Clerk's office manages the encoder and vendor for council meeting closed captioning, with City TV providing technical support. City TV does closed captioning for its own programming.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Clingan</strong> asked if the live stream of meetings has a closed caption feature.</li>
<li><strong>Director DiCarlo</strong> stated it would be connected to the Clerk's encoder output.</li>

<h4 id="somerviva-office-of-immigrant-affairs-soya">SomerViva Office of Immigrant Affairs (SOYA)</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Department:</strong> SomerViva Office of Immigrant Affairs</li>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Councilor Burnley</strong> asked about work on the language justice ordinance and coordination with CCE on plain language.</li>
<li><strong>Deputy Director Meredith Campbell</strong> confirmed that preparing a language access ordinance is a priority for the next fiscal year, with research underway and collaboration with the Law Department and Council planned. SOYA partners with CCE on plain language trainings and reviews communications for accessibility.</li>
<li><strong>Director Nájera</strong> added that SOYA has conducted extensive trainings for city staff on on-demand interpretation and the importance of language access, now fully staffed in Language Justice.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Mbah</strong> asked how outreach and education methodology has evolved during challenging times and how its impact is measured.</li>
<li><strong>Director Nájera</strong> explained that SOYA remains nimble, adapting to community needs, delivering "Know Your Rights" trainings, and leveraging trusted networks. They focus on building trust, addressing misinformation, and continuously evaluating their approach.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Scott</strong> asked about the low OM spend for FY2025, given the need for language access.</li>
<li><strong>Director Nájera</strong> stated that approximately $210,000 (over 90%) of the OM budget for language access services is expected to be spent by year-end. The remaining funds serve as emergency preparedness for unforeseen community needs.</li>

<h4 id="hhs-proper">HHS Proper</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Department:</strong> HHS Proper</li>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Councilor Mbah</strong> asked about the impact of federal policy changes and funding for health programs.</li>
<li><strong>Director Kress</strong> stated that HHS has faced challenges with grants, including one that was temporarily halted but later reinstated. They are monitoring federal decisions, particularly regarding vaccine billing.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Mbah</strong> asked about contingency plans for surges in communicable diseases if federal assistance is unavailable.</li>
<li><strong>Director Kress</strong> confirmed they are planning, participating in a regional public health excellence plan, and have an epidemiologist. They collaborate with nearby health departments.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Burnley</strong> asked about a $3,000 line for communication support in PTS.</li>
<li><strong>Director Kress</strong> explained it's a small budget for the health communication officer role, used for media campaigns, messaging, and in-house software like Canva.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Scott</strong> asked about the $10,000 for an OPC (Opioid Prevention Center) in last year's PTS line and its absence this year.</li>
<li><strong>Director Kress</strong> stated that the TA for an OPC was not utilized last year and was removed from this year's budget, as the project is on hold due to state-level legalities. HHS is focusing on other harm reduction strategies through partnerships (e.g., VHN, Fenway Health), CORE teams, community health workers, Narcan distribution, and public health vending machines.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Scott</strong> asked about the spending of opioid remediation funds.</li>
<li><strong>Director Kress</strong> confirmed funds are being spent on public health vending machines, sharps containers, and software for outreach teams. A memo detailing expenditures was submitted to the Public Health and Safety Committee.</li>

<h4 id="council-on-aging">Council on Aging</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Department:</strong> Council on Aging</li>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Councilor Mbah</strong> asked about the proposed increase in the salary line.</li>
<li><strong>Director Spelliotis</strong> explained it's a direct result of the compensation study and salary adjustments, not new staff hires. The department is fully staffed.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Mbah</strong> asked about potential loss of federal funding and impacts on seniors.</li>
<li><strong>Director Spelliotis</strong> noted challenges with outside agencies like Social Security and the Department of Transitional Assistance, where dedicated lines for seniors have been removed, causing delays. She mentioned that 18% of Somerville seniors receive cash assistance or food stamp benefits, higher than the state average. A Title III transportation grant is currently unstable.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Clingan</strong> asked about the $295,000 in "other lump sum payments."</li>
<li><strong>Director Spelliotis</strong> confirmed it relates to retroactive salary adjustments from SMEU negotiations.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Clingan</strong> asked about the increase in the uniform allowance to $17,000.</li>
<li><strong>Director Spelliotis</strong> stated it's built into the SMEU contract.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Clingan</strong> asked about the security guard at the library.</li>
<li><strong>Director Spelliotis</strong> clarified that the funding for the part-time security position (19 hours/week) came from library state aid funding for FY2025. The contract ends this month, and they will go through procurement again for FY2026.</li>

<h4 id="summer-promise">Summer Promise</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Department:</strong> Summer Promise</li>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Councilor Wilson</strong> asked how the department plans to meet the demand for out-of-school time programming, given family anxieties.</li>
<li><strong>Director Hosman</strong> explained they are expanding the Somerville Community Schools program, using survey data to identify needs beyond waitlists. They are exploring bringing private partners into SPS to assist, aiming for a sliding fee scale across all programs for sustainability. They are also working on in-person registration sessions.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Wilson</strong> asked about the efficiency of outside providers.</li>
<li><strong>Director Hosman</strong> stated that the sliding fee scale across both private partners and community schools should lead to a self-funding model. She believes a mixed delivery model (community partners, SPS, private partners) is the best approach to offer diverse options for families.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Wilson</strong> asked if out-of-school time should reside entirely within Summer Promise.</li>
<li><strong>Director Hosman</strong> believes the current mixed delivery model, with SPS staff managing programs within school buildings, alleviates barriers and offers more options than a single city-run department.</li>

<h4 id="veterans-services">Veterans Services</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Department:</strong> Veterans Services</li>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Councilor Mbah</strong> asked about the salary line increase and OM decrease, and if it indicates fewer claims or a shrinking veteran population.</li>
<li><strong>Director Thomas</strong> confirmed that the passing of World War II and Korean War veterans, along with veterans moving out of the city for more affordable housing, contributes to a decrease in the veteran population. The salary increase is due to compensation adjustments.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Wilson</strong> asked if the decrease in veterans benefits primarily reflects a drop in unemployment claims.</li>
<li><strong>Director Thomas</strong> stated that while unemployment plays a part, many claims are from the senior population. Veterans who find adequate income are removed from the benefits line.</li>

<h4 id="racial-and-social-justice-rsj">Racial and Social Justice (RSJ)</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Department:</strong> Racial and Social Justice</li>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Councilor Scott</strong> inquired about the RSJ fund, noting it was set up with $750,000 in 2020 and largely untouched. He asked if the only expenditures were for three positions (Public Safety for All Project Manager and two rental assistance positions in HHS).</li>
<li><strong>Director Nájera</strong> confirmed that the RSJ fund balance is $1,115,615. The three positions are the only expenditures to date, aligning with the fund's mission to dismantle systemic racism and social inequities. Goal 3 for the coming fiscal year is to deploy funds directly to community members.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Scott</strong> asked if RSJ reviewed the police staffing study.</li>
<li><strong>Director Nájera</strong> stated RSJ is not the primary manager of next steps but supports PD in moving recommendations forward, particularly regarding community affairs units.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Burnley</strong> asked if the city still uses a third-party brailler in addition to the in-house one.</li>
<li><strong>Director Nájera</strong> confirmed that for more complex projects or those requiring staff fluent in Braille, they still outsource. They are piloting in-house embossing for agendas and meeting minutes with the Super Commission for Persons with Disabilities. Four staff members are currently trained.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Burnley</strong> asked where the brailler is housed.</li>
<li><strong>Director Nájera</strong> stated it's at the RSJ Suite at 167 Paula Street.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Burnley</strong> asked about the mediation line in PTS and planned programming.</li>
<li><strong>Director Nájera</strong> explained they are exploring mediation opportunities, building on FY25 programs like "active bystanders" and "Neighbors Talking to Neighbors." They hope to train commissioners, starting with the Human Rights Commission, in mediation.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Burnley</strong> asked about in-person vs. virtual mediations and safety contingencies.</li>
<li><strong>Director Nájera</strong> stated they envision both in-person and virtual options to reach the most people, prioritizing safety through advance registration and clear ground rules.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Burnley</strong> asked if the Deputy Director position's September start date would be impacted by the hiring freeze.</li>
<li><strong>Director Nájera</strong> stated the goal is a September 1st start, with RSJ and HR working closely to ensure it. The RHA coordinator position aims for a July 1st start. The Commissions Coordinator role has a January 1st date, but cross-training is in place for interim support.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Burnley</strong> asked about the scope of the Commissions Coordinator role.</li>
<li><strong>Director Nájera</strong> stated the job description is not yet posted. Previously, it supported the Human Rights Commission and the Somerville Commission for Women. They are assessing whether it will support all three commissions within the department.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Mbah</strong> thanked the Director for her work and offered support.</li>

<h4 id="somerstat">SomerStat</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Department:</strong> SomerStat</li>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Councilor Burnley</strong> asked about the impact of funding cuts on services and major reports for the year.</li>
<li><strong>SomerStat Analyst Megan Kennedy</strong> stated that the funding reduction is limited, primarily impacting the second phase of intern hiring (January start) due to the hiring freeze.</li>
<li><strong>SomerStat Analyst</strong> stated their primary goal is to release happiness survey results mid-fiscal year. They also anticipate a first draft of a "focus areas dashboard" (progress report on city goals).</li>
<li><strong>Megan Kennedy</strong> added that they will be analyzing data from ARPA-funded projects and hope to release outcomes and reports in the second half of FY2026.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Burnley</strong> asked if analysts work with other departments to steer policy based on data.</li>
<li><strong>SomerStat Analyst</strong> confirmed they work closely with other departments, using their input for data gathering (e.g., happiness survey questions) and providing data back for reuse and additional analysis.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Burnley</strong> noted that out-of-state travel was higher than projected in FY2025 and asked if the FY2026 budget would accommodate this.</li>
<li><strong>SomerStat Analyst</strong> explained that the FY2025 overage was due to a conference in a more distant location. The FY2026 budget accounts for one person traveling, which is expected to be sufficient.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Burnley</strong> asked about the intern program.</li>
<li><strong>SomerStat Analyst</strong> explained that interns perform operational work, enabling staff to focus on strategic tasks, and serve as a talent pipeline. A recent co-op revamped the "Somerville at a glance" page.</li>
