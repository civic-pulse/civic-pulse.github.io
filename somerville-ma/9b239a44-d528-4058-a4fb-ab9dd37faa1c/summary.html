<h4 id="51-central-broadway-corridor-zoning-study">5.1 Central Broadway Corridor Zoning Study</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Staff Update (Steve Carey):</strong><ul>
<li>A zoning study of the Central Broadway Corridor (between Ball Square and Magoun Square) was completed.</li>
<li>An initial public presentation in March was poorly attended due to a conflicting emergency rally at Tufts University.</li>
<li>Another public meeting is scheduled for next Tuesday to present the study to the community.</li>
<li>The study may inform future zoning map amendments, as several City Councilors are interested.</li>
<li>The study is not a plan for adoption but rather information to inform future planning initiatives.</li>
<li>The study originated from a state grant to address parcels split between Somerville and Medford along Broadway, aiming to harmonize zoning.</li>
<li>Medford's planning director is hoped to be in attendance at the upcoming meeting to discuss Medford's progress on their zoning plan.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Board Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li>Councilor Amelia Aboff inquired if the Board would have a discussion on the study materials at an upcoming meeting, given it might eventually come before them for approval. Steve Carey clarified it's a study, not a plan for adoption, but the Board could add it as an official agenda item for discussion.</li>
<li>Councilor Jahan Habib thanked Steve Carey for sharing such relevant information, suggesting that similar updates on zoning studies or community engagement events be regularly provided to the Board.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="52-draw-seven-park-pedestrian-bridge-chapter-91-application">5.2 Draw Seven Park Pedestrian Bridge (Chapter 91 Application)</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Staff Update (Steve Carey):</strong><ul>
<li>The Planning Board has the opportunity to submit a written recommendation as part of the Chapter 91 application process for the pedestrian bridge.</li>
<li>There was confusion regarding the start date of the review period, as the materials were not received by the division until late August due to City Hall's AC issues.</li>
<li>The legal department's take is that the 45-day review period would likely start when the Planning Board formally acknowledges receipt of the materials.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Board Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li>Chairman Michael Capuano questioned the Board's role, stating he doesn't feel the need to make a recommendation on the sufficiency of the bridge design, assuming compliance with requirements.</li>
<li>Councilor Lynn Richards emphasized the importance of the Board's role in reviewing the design, comparing it to building design reviews. She expressed disappointment at the lack of detailed design information (20% design with cost elements, but not detailed sketches of how it grounds into Somerville). She advocated for a "beautiful bridge," not just a "nice bridge," and believes the Board should influence the design.</li>
<li>Councilor Michael McNeely referenced 3.10 CMR, Section 9.13, Subsection 5, which outlines the Board's ability to weigh in on whether the project is detrimental to public rights in tidelands and serves a proper public purpose. He expressed a desire to support the bridge's functionality for pedestrian and biking connectivity but felt insufficient materials were provided for a comprehensive assessment.</li>
<li>Councilor Amelia Aboff suggested a "middle path," focusing on the functionality and connectivity of the bridge rather than aesthetics, and aligning any recommendation with Somerville's strategic plan, "SomerVision," by calling out relevant principles.</li>
<li>Chairman Michael Capuano inquired about the timeline for the Chapter 91 review. Steve Carey confirmed a 45-day period (30 days for a public hearing, 15 days for a recommendation), but the start date is still unclear.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Motion:</strong> Michael Capuano moved to acknowledge receipt of the materials for the Draw Seven Park Pedestrian Bridge and request additional materials, specifically conceptual design details regarding how the bridge connects to the land on the Somerville side, including lighting, seating, and potential bump-outs, to inform a timely recommendation by the October 2nd meeting. The motion also included a request for a legal opinion from the Solicitor's Office regarding the exact expiration of the review period.</li>
<li><strong>Second:</strong> Amelia Aboff.</li>
<li><strong>Vote:</strong><ul>
<li>Jahan Habib: Aye</li>
<li>Lynn Richards: Aye</li>
<li>Luke Schuster: Aye</li>

<li>Michael Capuano: Aye</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Outcome:</strong> Motion passed (6-0).</li>
