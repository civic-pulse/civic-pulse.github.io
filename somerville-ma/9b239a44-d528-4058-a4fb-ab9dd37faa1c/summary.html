<h4 id="51-central-broadway-corridor-zoning-study">5.1 Central Broadway Corridor Zoning Study</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Staff Update (Steve Carey):</strong><ul>
<li>A zoning study of the Central Broadway Corridor (between Ball Square and Magoon Square) was completed and presented to the public in March.</li>
<li>Due to low attendance at the initial public presentation (coinciding with an emergency rally at Tufts University), another public meeting is scheduled for next Tuesday.</li>
<li>The study is not a plan for adoption but rather an informational document to inform future planning initiatives and potential zoning map amendments, particularly given interest from City Councilors.</li>
<li>The study's impetus was a state grant to harmonize zoning between Somerville and Medford along the shared border on Broadway.</li>
<li>Medford's planning director has been invited to attend the upcoming meeting to discuss Medford's progress on their proposed zoning map.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Board Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li>Amelia Aboff inquired if the Board would discuss the study at an upcoming meeting, assuming it might eventually come before them for approval. Steve Carey clarified it's a study, not a plan for adoption, but the Board could add it as an official agenda item for discussion if desired.</li>
<li>Jahan Habib thanked Steve Carey for sharing such relevant information, suggesting it's helpful for Board members to be aware of ongoing studies and community engagement events.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="52-draw-seven-park-bridge-project-chapter-91-application">5.2 Draw Seven Park Bridge Project (Chapter 91 Application)</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Staff Update (Steve Carey):</strong><ul>
<li>The Planning Board has the opportunity to submit a written recommendation as part of the Chapter 91 application process for the Draw Seven Park Bridge.</li>
<li>There was confusion regarding the receipt date of materials, impacting the 45-day review period. Staff is seeking legal opinion on when the clock started.</li>
<li>The Board's role is to decide if it wants to submit a recommendation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Board Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Michael Capuano:</strong> Expressed initial reluctance to make a recommendation on the bridge's sufficiency, noting a general desire for a "nice bridge."</li>
<li><strong>Lynn Richards:</strong> Emphasized the importance of the bridge's design and its connection to the Somerville side, comparing it to the Board's scrutiny of building designs. She highlighted that a "20% design" from engineers typically includes conceptual sketches, and the Board should influence for a "beautiful bridge," not just a "nice bridge," given its unique opportunity.</li>
<li><strong>Michael McNeely:</strong> Referenced 310 CMR 9.13(5), noting the Board could weigh in on whether the project is detrimental to public rights in tidelands and great ponds, and if it serves a proper public purpose. He expressed a desire to support improved pedestrian and biking connectivity but felt more material was needed.</li>
<li><strong>Amelia Aboff:</strong> Suggested focusing on the functionality and connectivity of the bridge rather than aesthetics, and proposed using Somerville Vision principles to guide a letter to DCR, outlining community priorities.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Proposed Action:</strong> Acknowledge receipt of materials and request additional renderings or conceptual design materials, particularly concerning the bridge's connection to the park, lighting, seating, and bump-outs, to inform a timely recommendation by the October 2nd meeting. Concurrently, seek a legal opinion from the Solicitor's office on the Chapter 91 review period deadline.</li>
<li><strong>Motion:</strong> The Chair moved to acknowledge receipt of the materials and request additional materials (specifically conceptual design drawings related to the bridge's connection to the park, lighting, seating, and bump-outs) to inform a timely recommendation by the October 2nd meeting, in conjunction with an opinion from the Solicitor's office on the Chapter 91 review period.</li>
<li><strong>Second:</strong> Amelia Aboff</li>
<li><strong>Vote:</strong><ul>
<li>Jahan Habib: Aye</li>
<li>Lynn Richards: Aye</li>
<li>Luc Schuster: Aye</li>
<li>Michael McNeely: Aye</li>
<li>Amelia Aboff: Aye</li>
<li>Michael Capuano: Aye</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Outcome:</strong> Motion passed (6-0).</li>
