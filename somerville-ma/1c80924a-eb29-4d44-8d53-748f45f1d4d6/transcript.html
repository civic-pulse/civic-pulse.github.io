Both came to Somerville when they were in their twenties. Both opened businesses here as well. One on Medford Street. It was a convenience store at the time. Yeah. And I also worked with the Everett Animal Control. I&#39;ve volunteered for other dog businesses and rescues in the area in Peabody called Sweet Paws Rescue is another one. Yeah, I&#39;d like to keep running my business and hopefully do that in Somerville.</td>

I certainly want to have a public conversation about this because during my tenure as chair of this committee, we have had some issues with previous kennels that have led to some unfortunate behaviors from business owners and necessary disciplinary actions from this committee. So just wanted to have a public conversation to set expectations. So I&#39;ll start by just saying, you&#39;ve mentioned that you are already a business owner in this space, that you&#39;ve worked with dogs before. just want to make sure and say for the record, it is in the application. This is not an overnight license. No dogs will be allowed to stay overnight in this space. And to ask a question to the applicant, you would be prepared to make sure that this space is completely habitable for the animals. Warmth in the winters, enough staff in order to manage 30 dogs, et cetera.</td>

As long as their safety and the safety of the staff is prioritized, I see no reason why this application should not move forward.

There are some residence is across the street, I believe.

                <td>I recently took over the place, and I do see there are some residents in front of us, but nighttime, I believe it&#39;s mostly, I don&#39;t think there are going to be a lot of walk-ins. It&#39;s mostly going to be for delivery guys, like the third party. We&#39;re not going to have our own delivery. We&#39;re just going to focus on the third-party delivery companies, and at nighttime, I don&#39;t think There&#39;s any traffic or like there&#39;ll be a problem with the parking. So I don&#39;t think like, and we don&#39;t play any loud music. It&#39;s a tiny takeout place with like 18 seating. So hopefully like it will be sound and peaceful and none of the neighbors will complain about it. That&#39;s what my plan is. Like, we&#39;re not going to make it like too loud. We&#39;re going to make it like as, I&#39;m like, we cannot handle more orders as well. So we&#39;ll see as we go. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to be that crazy busy. So people will be congested. The drivers will be hunking. Because looking at the daytime and the nighttime sales, we&#39;re just trying to get some more businesses because daytime, it&#39;s like two competitive markets nowadays. And nighttime, I see like kind of few potential where we can uplift ourselves. That&#39;s why we&#39;re trying to do it like till 4 a.m. So we&#39;ll see down the road how it&#39;s going to go. But I don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to be that crowded that the neighbors will be complaining about it.</td>

                <td> Yeah, certainly. As I mentioned before, there are no businesses in this area that would be also open that late. So there would, as far as I am aware, would be no competition for, you know, parking from the space, you know, other, you know, delivery drivers trying to get in and out of other spaces. Of course, the city, just to say for the record, does have a noise complaint ordinance. If you do get this application or this license and there is a series of noise complaints that come out of it, we will be back in this meeting to talk about that. We can adjust. And the reason I asked about the hours is not just simply because of the hours, but because as the applicant, you asked for 4 a.m. for both delivery and in-store purchases. I went to college. I can certainly imagine being a college student who&#39;s hungry at 3 in the morning and don&#39;t have a place to grab food. We just want to make sure that all business that is done in this establishment, even into the late hours, is commiserate with the the values of our community and that we&#39;re not, you know, causing any havoc for anybody. But, you know, I think we should lead with grace and, you know, readiness. So I certainly Don&#39;t have any more questions. I see Councilor Clingan has another question or comment.</td>

I&#39;m knock on wood. I haven&#39;t had any complaints. I&#39;m happy to do whatever we can to help our small businesses So, yeah, I just that&#39;s been my experience with two two different late night ones. We opened in Ward four and I haven&#39;t heard anything. So that&#39;s a that&#39;s why, you know, it&#39;s a good sign. Hopefully this area feels the same way about the late night. And but, yeah, happy, happy to. I hear you on on your cautiousness and concerns. Absolutely. But with my historical so far, the little history I have with the situation, it&#39;s been good.</td>

There&#39;s not a lot of noise. The workers are friendly and kind. And although we did have some concerns from residents at the time of that application, I have certainly not heard anything about noise spilling out or causing anyone harm.

I guess I just questions around not so much noise that your particular establishment would produce, but rather delivery drivers who you don&#39;t necessarily have control over. What&#39;s been your experience with delivery drivers potentially blasting music even during the daytime? And how would you be handling that at the hours of, you know, 1 to 4 a.m. ?</td>

I don&#39;t feel like the delivery driver at nighttime, like this should be mindful about it because it&#39;s a quiet neighborhood. So I don&#39;t think like they will be blasting a music, anything like that. And as I said, most of the establishments will be closed. So the parking space will be available easily. So it will be quick grab and go. I don&#39;t think like we&#39;re going to have a lot of crowd at late night, like the 10 or 15 delivery driver will be lined up because it&#39;s just an Indian store. We&#39;re just trying to just like do a little better than what we&#39;re doing right now. But I don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to be too crowded that the delivery driver will be hanging out or have to wait for a long time outside. So it&#39;s going to be quick grab and go. The parking space will be there. The food will be ready soon. We&#39;re going to minimize the food items as well. So it&#39;s going to be like pretty quick grab and go. So that&#39;s what my experience is like. I don&#39;t think like the delivery driver will be hanging out in the area for a longer time, maybe just to pick up the food and just grab and go. So that would be my idea.</td>
