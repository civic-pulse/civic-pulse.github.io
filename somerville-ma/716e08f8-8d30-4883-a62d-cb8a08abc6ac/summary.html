<ul>
<li><strong>Speaker:</strong> Ellen Schechter, Director of Office of Housing Stability</li>
<li><strong>Key Discussion Points:</strong><ul>
<li>The 2024 Housing Bond Bill introduced policy changes regarding condominium conversions and evictions, primarily authorizing cities and towns to regulate buildings with four or more units.</li>
<li>Somerville's existing legislation, dating back to 1985, already regulates all two, three, and four-family buildings, regardless of owner occupancy, exceeding the new state law's provisions.</li>
<li>The new state law is estimated to regulate an additional 287,200 units statewide, tripling the number of regulated buildings and nearly doubling protected units.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Ben Ewen-Campen</strong> inquired about the possibility of resident preference for purchasing units during condo conversions.<ul>
<li><strong>Response from Director Schechter:</strong> Tenants already have a right of first purchase during condominium conversions. While direct residency preference for general market sales is legally complex due to anti-discrimination and fair housing laws, Somerville has successfully implemented residency preferences for inclusionary and 100 Homes programs where data showed no disadvantage to marginalized communities.</li>

<li><strong>Speaker:</strong> Ellen Schechter, Director of Office of Housing Stability</li>

<li><strong>No-fault evictions:</strong> Can be sealed if the case was dismissed.</li>
<li><strong>Non-payment evictions:</strong><ul>

<li>Sealable after four years (with no intervening eviction) if the tenant demonstrates financial hardship preventing full payment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Fault evictions:</strong> Sealable after seven years (with no intervening eviction) if the tenant demonstrates changed behavior.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Outreach Efforts (since May 5th):</strong><ul>
<li>Collaboration with Cambridge for a regional Eviction Defense response.</li>
<li>Six workshops conducted with partner agencies (TAS, Cambridge and Somerville Legal Services, De Novo Legal Services, Multi-Service Center, Housing Liaison in Cambridge).</li>
<li>Over 100 letters sent to clients with potential sealing opportunities.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Speaker:</strong> Dana Whiteside, Deputy Director of Economic Development</li>
<li><strong>Key Discussion Points:</strong><ul>
<li>The Economic Development Division relies on SomerStat for economic data and research, including sales tax data to track economic impact.</li>
<li>Anecdotal evidence from face-to-face interactions with small businesses indicates strong concerns for their livelihood and worker safety.</li>
<li><strong>Support Initiatives:</strong><ul>

<li><strong>ARPA Grants:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Vitality Grant:</strong> $576,117 distributed to 30 brick-and-mortar businesses (January-August 2024).</li>
<li><strong>Business Enrichment Program:</strong> $1.3 million in technical assistance for financing, planning, operations, and marketing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Urban Agenda Grant:</strong> Facilitated workshops and one-on-one consulting for marketing and food safety. Provided stipends of approximately $350 each to 17 home-based childcare providers.</li>
<li><strong>FY26 Goals (with limited financial resources):</strong><ul>
<li>Enhance technical assistance communication.</li>
<li>Expand reach with sister agencies for best practices guidance.</li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Leasing Handbook:</strong> Created with the Massachusetts Area Planning Council, available in English, Spanish, Portuguese, and Haitian Creole.</li>
<li><strong>Online Workshops:</strong> All Urban Agenda Grant workshops are now videotaped and available online.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Marketing and Promotion:</strong><ul>
<li>The division aims to use its platform to promote "doing business in Somerville" without promoting specific businesses.</li>
<li>A part-time intern is developing a social media policy to clarify how platforms can support businesses.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Partnerships:</strong><ul>
<li>Strengthening partnerships, particularly with the Chamber of Commerce.</li>
<li>Collaboration with the Chamber enabled 35 new, local, minority-owned businesses to participate in "Taste of Somerville" with reduced fees and access to the Chamber network.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Staff Recognition:</strong> Kellyanne Loughlin, Leticia Terroria, and Adriana Fernandez were commended for their work and relational approach.</li>
<li><strong>Weekly Business Office Hours:</strong> Thursdays at 4 PM via Zoom, with language accommodation available, including representatives from ISD and crisis services.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Kristen Strezo</strong> inquired about assistance for small businesses with tax IDs and vendor processes.<ul>
<li><strong>Response from Deputy Director Whiteside:</strong> This is addressed in online workshops. The Economic Development Division can connect businesses with relevant city departments and triage questions received via email.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Outcome:</strong> Item to remain in committee for ongoing discussion.</li>

<h3 id="mayors-request-251005-trusting-approval-of-the-2025-2026-urban-development-one-year-action-plan">Mayor's Request 251005: Trusting Approval of the 2025-2026 Urban Development One-Year Action Plan</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Speaker:</strong> Alan Ignacio, Director of Finance and Community Development, OSPCD; Miranda Rubin, Program Compliance Officer, OSPCD</li>
<li><strong>Key Discussion Points:</strong><ul>
<li>This is an annual item for the approval of the one-year action plan for HUD entitlement programs.</li>
<li><strong>Funding Levels (relatively level-funded):</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Community Development Block Grant (CDBG):</strong> $2,477,825 (funds a wide variety of activities).</li>
<li><strong>Home Investment Partnership (HOME):</strong> $517,544 (focuses on housing activities and new housing development).</li>
<li><strong>Emergency Solutions Grant (ESG):</strong> $218,817 (focuses on homelessness prevention and support services).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Significant Item of Note:</strong> For the first time in 20 years, the city will leverage the full financing capabilities of the CDBG program through a Section 108 borrowing.<ul>
<li>This will provide approximately $10 million in financing for Phase 2 of the Clarendon Hill project.</li>
<li>This will cost the city approximately $500,000 in annual entitlement payments but is deemed crucial for the much-needed Clarendon Hill project.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Kristen Strezo</strong> noted the absence of ARPA funds and inquired about significant changes from the previous year's plan.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Ben Ewen-Campen</strong> had no further questions.</li>
<li><strong>Outcome:</strong> Item to be sent to the full City Council for approval.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="order-251200-director-of-economic-development-update-on-efforts-to-mitigate-construction-impacts-on-small-businesses">Order 251200: Director of Economic Development Update on Efforts to Mitigate Construction Impacts on Small Businesses</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Speaker:</strong> Dana Whiteside, Deputy Director of Economic Development</li>
<li><strong>Key Discussion Points:</strong><ul>
<li>This item was added at the request of Councilor Judy Pineda-Neufeld.</li>
<li><strong>Limited Resources:</strong> Economic Development has limited funding to directly support businesses impacted by construction.</li>
<li><strong>Role as Convener:</strong> The division's primary role is to bring together partners involved in construction considerations.</li>
<li><strong>Categorization of Projects:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>City-led projects:</strong> More control over communication and mitigation.</li>
<li><strong>Non-city-led projects (e.g., independent contractors, Eversource):</strong> Less direct control, but the division aims to improve alignment and communication to prevent businesses from being "caught by surprise."</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Intentional Communication:</strong> The division is initiating conversations with the Engineering Department and Communications Department to improve strategic communication for city-led projects.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Kristen Strezo</strong> shared examples of negative construction impacts:<ul>
<li>Businesses unaware of jackhammering, leading to lost business.</li>
<li>Impact of snow days on small businesses due to reduced foot traffic and parking issues.</li>
<li>Concerns about contractors disrespecting residents (e.g., driving wrong way, leaving debris, placing porta-potties inappropriately).</li>
<li>Questioned the city's power to choose contractors based on community respect and the need for better communication (e.g., yard signs, clear project timelines).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Ben Ewen-Campen</strong> shared experiences from Spring Hill and Somerville Ave construction projects:<ul>
<li>Acknowledged improvements in city outreach but noted missed opportunities for basic communication.</li>
<li>Suggested more visible, friendly signage (e.g., "businesses are open, please support").</li>
<li>Recalled initial negative reactions to long-term construction announcements (e.g., "expect disruptions for the next three years") and the need for proactive, rather than reactive, communication.</li>
<li>Emphasized that while construction is inherently disruptive, better communication and visible support can build goodwill between the city and small businesses.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Deputy Director Whiteside</strong> agreed that there is an opportunity for the city to be more strategic and effective in its communications, regardless of who controls the construction project. He expressed willingness to continue the conversation and seek input from the committee.</li>
<li><strong>Outcome:</strong> Item to remain in committee for ongoing discussion.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="resolution-251178-administration-notifying-mobile-square-businesses-of-black-construction-projects">Resolution 251178: Administration Notifying Mobile Square Businesses of Black Construction Projects</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Key Discussion Points:</strong><ul>
<li>This resolution is related to the previous item on construction impacts.</li>
<li>The Deputy Director of Economic Development suggested keeping this item in committee and integrating it with the broader discussion on construction impacts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Outcome:</strong> Item to remain in committee for ongoing discussion.</li>
