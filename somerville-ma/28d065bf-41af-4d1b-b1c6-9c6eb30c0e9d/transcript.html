And we&#39;ll also connect to the future pedestrian bridge that will cross the mystic. Uh, but the beach nourishment, which is what we are here for today, um, will include cleaning up the debris on the beach, which will include like glass bricks. There&#39;s some concrete blocks out there and replacing what is removed with the appropriate grain size material that will match the existing site conditions. We did a preliminary particle size analysis that was conducted during the design and robust sampling program is proposed and will be the responsibility of the contractor. This will include taking samples of six different survey profiles along the beach. And each profile will have three samples taken just to make sure that we&#39;re matching the existing beach material. So that will be happening from the high, high tide line, which is this cyan color and below.</td>

Also, the developer is here a line says, and Jerry McDonough if there are any questions. uh relative to them answering so a little bit of a history here uh we were before you about four years ago on this project i believe and we were granted zoning relief to construct a building uh this is at 379 some of the lab And historically, it&#39;s a little bit before my time, but it was a nightclub called Thunder Road. So I know originally we talked about having that come back. Well, after zoning relief, as things progressed in the building permit stages, things changed relative to Eversource. I&#39;m not sure if the board knows we were before the zoning board of appeals last night for 4 variances regarding this matter. So that&#39;s why we&#39;re now before you. What I&#39;m thinking is at this time last night, we&#39;re going to keep it kind of similar little condensed of a presentation of what we did from last night. It just makes sense. We&#39;ll take over. He has a timeline because he was the 1 working on the building permit. And then the issues.</td>

So we&#39;re excited to be here, Chair Capuano and board members. Good to see you again. This has been a long process. We started this in 2023 of July. So these are three units. It&#39;s a challenging site. It&#39;s been quite the journey, but we&#39;re excited to present tonight. And hopefully you can appreciate and see the the vision that we&#39;ve been working on the improvements to the neighborhood to the corner and to the site so I&#39;m going to pass it off to Paul Miller who&#39;s going to present and Curtis will be leading the landscape architecture part so thank you thanks Pablo good evening to the board it&#39;s good to see everyone again</td>

                <td> Paul Miller, i&#39;m Paul Miller principal at neighbor architects were leading the design team on this project and i&#39;m joined tonight by curtis puncher from ground Inc, who is the landscape architect. i&#39;m going to go ahead and share my screen. Okay, we can get started everyone see my screen okay. Great okay. So just to start off with a little bit of context about 181 Pearl Street. This is in East Somerville near Gilman Square. You can see our site highlighted here in red. Gilman&#39;s at the kind of end of Pearl Street up near Sarma, the high school, the library. It&#39;s an exciting site to be working on at the corner of Pearl and Dana and adjacent to McGrath Highway. It&#39;s got a lot of visibility because of the movement across McGrath, and we feel like it&#39;s a well-connected site as well and a great opportunity for transit-oriented development. There is good access to bus lines as well as the Gilman Square T Station and many public amenities within walking and biking distance. This is the photograph of the existing site, the former Mudville Pottery Studio that was there. It&#39;s since been demolished and is waiting for the next steps of the project. The context is, the immediate context are two and a half story single family and two family homes, as well as triple deckers nearby. There&#39;s a gas station across Pearl Street. some larger six unit buildings and larger masonry buildings as you move further down Pearl Street, they get up towards five and six floors. So what we&#39;re proposing on the site, which is zoned MR3, three residential apartments, the building&#39;s three stories and about 3,600 gross square feet. We kind of at the beginning of the design Christopher McConkey, process. Christopher McConkey, began by looking really carefully at the site, given that it&#39;s quite tight. Christopher McConkey, And we really wanted to create something that was a benefit to the neighborhood. Christopher McConkey, Given the high visibility corner. Christopher McConkey, And sort of the lack of. Christopher McConkey, streets amenities like trees and plants at this corner. So we&#39;ve wrapped both Dana and Pearl Street with a planter that Curtis from Ground is going to talk about in a little bit. We also added a street tree on Pearl Street. And beneath that street tree, a bench which is built into the planter and kind of extends the stoop culture, you know, that we see throughout Somerville. The entrance into the site is off of Pearl Street. We wanted to make sure that anyone could access this building. Ramps are required in the Somerville zoning code and also a zero step entrance into the building. So rather than having a separate ramp and stairs, we felt it would be important to integrate the access into just a single ramp. So this ramp comes off of Pearl Street and leads to a small courtyard entrance into the building. where there&#39;s a small lobby with bike parking for residents. We are using permeable paving throughout the site. And it is an all electric building. This is a view of the project from Pearl and Dana Street. The primary cladding material is an aluminum panel in a color called silversmith, which picks up the color of the sky and the neighborhood around it. We wanted to use aluminum as a kind of robust material and use it in a contemporary way. Given the context around the building, the proximity of McGrath Highway, we wanted something that felt kind of robust here. But we were interested in picking up on some of the cues throughout the neighborhood. And so we see this triangular profile that we&#39;ve selected as a kind of contemporary interpretation of clapboard siding. Here it&#39;s run vertical, but you still get the kind of shadow lines across it that you would see on clapboard siding. And as we&#39;ve carved away balcony spaces for each unit, we&#39;re using a mint green color that picks up on some of the plants and the planters and the new street tree. And you see in the foreground, as well as on the site walls, a red brick cladding on the planters on those walls that kind of picks up on the red brick planters that you&#39;ll see throughout the neighborhood, as we&#39;re showing here in the lower left-hand corner. This is a view from Pearl Street looking towards the entrance. You can see those site walls that I was just describing. and a copper colored metal panel that serves as sort of an accent on this entry sequence into the building. And in a close-up view of that entrance, you can see the bench that I was describing earlier and a close-up of the ramp. Just another view of that entrance off of Pearl Street. And this is the Dana Street facade. You can see the other red brick site wall. We really were trying to be thoughtful about how we treated the edge condition here, given the kind of proximity of the neighbors. So the site wall is designed so that it&#39;s tall when it needs to provide privacy and it drops away a little bit when it doesn&#39;t need to. I should also say that the property line for 181 Pearl Street runs down the middle of the Dana Street neighbors driveway and our clients felt it was important from the beginning of the project to allow them to keep their driveway and so we&#39;re we started our design project from the kind of Edge of that existing driveway just some details on the facade um we um created a break line at each floor that the windows and the cladding are aligned with. And we&#39;re bringing color into the material palette with the guardrails and the sashes of the windows. I&#39;m going to hand it over to Curtis from Ground to talk about the landscape design.</td>

                <td>Thanks, Paul. Curtis Puncher from Ground Landscape Architects, speaking at 2181 Pearl Street. So 100% of the trees, shrubs, grasses, and perennials on this project are native. As Paul mentioned, we are wrapping the building on three sides with planting. sort of soften, you know, soften that pedestrian experience along this section of the streetscape. There are bulbs in here as well. They are, you know, early spring interest. So they do deviate from the native palette, but they&#39;re sort of isolated in their seasonality. um elsewhere on the project we do have um permeable permeable paving um planned north and west and there is a sunken um gravel surface sort of plan northeast on the top of the page there um that&#39;s to allow light into a lower unit so all of the hardscapes surrounding this building is permeable um and we&#39;ll sort of revisit that when we talk about the green score And we are, there is currently no street trees adjacent to this property and we are adding one white oak you see there on on page south on Pearl Street. Go ahead for the next slide. Here&#39;s just a closer look on some of the species that we&#39;re using again. All shrubs, perennials and grasses are native, as well as the tree, of course. Next slide. Just a quick look at some of the details here, as well as getting into the green score. So our target for the project is 0.3, and we&#39;re achieving a score of 0.33. To get there, you know, we&#39;re looking at the soil depth greater than two feet and that&#39;s achieved in that perimeter planting as well as the permeable paving that&#39;s wrapping the north and west side of the building and the species that we are using will will grow more than um well a good portion of the species we&#39;re proposing um will achieve a two feet or higher um maturity Um, but there is a, there is a portion of ground cover species that will be less than that. So, um, you know, taking all of those factors into account, that&#39;s how we get to that 0.33. Um, and I just, yeah, I wanted to keep it brief because I want to leave room for questions and discussion. Thank you.</td>

Um, kind of with the with the corner location, gonna set back from McGrath Highway. Um, it seems like you have a little bit of a um of a boundary issue with the neighbor and and the and the driveway. I can&#39;t speak on behalf of them, but if I were them, I&#39;d be very appreciative of the fact that you&#39;re working with them to not take away their driveway. So for the three units that you have, can you tell me about the unit mix that you&#39;ve got?</td>

And you come out of the stairwell into your kind of kitchen and living room space. Both units have a balcony off of that kitchen and living room space, a covered balcony. And then there are two bedrooms on the north side of the plan as well as the bathroom. So this is the second floor. The third floor is very similar, except it has bay windows. Christopher McConkey, And the balcony kind of centered between those the bedroom and bathroom configuration is the same. Christopher McConkey, The first floor unit is the unique one, as I mentioned, it is accessible.

But it&#39;s part of the reason that we tried to make those biking, you know, the bike inside, there was versions of this with kind of parking from the bike from the exterior. So we wanted to put an emphasis on safe interior bike parking, geared towards people that, you know, are not going to have cars and won&#39;t have, you know, stickers to park in the street. So it was our assumption from the beginning.</td>

So those were my two thoughts. I do appreciate you guys working kind of diligently on a site that&#39;s, like I said, more difficult. I&#39;m not always a fan of super modern designs, but this one, it&#39;s a little bit different in a way that I think kind of works. So those are my thoughts. Thank you. Daniel PassamaneckIHL- Was.

COB, Bethany Collins, submission of final materials to planning staff for review, and I think, given the more modern palette here, and particularly the use of color as an accent.

We have not been working at it as long as the previous one, but we&#39;re all very familiar with the area of the context. The site is next to some favorite businesses of ours, not ours, but that we go to and enjoy. And from the beginning, we had a fun time Pablo Carreon- designing this building and thinking about the future of Davis square and the things that are coming and trying to respect our neighbors and the businesses that we enjoy going to and we&#39;re we&#39;re yeah we&#39;re very excited for representing tonight, so I will pass it over to Paul again and we&#39;ll go from there, thank you.</td>

                <td>Paul Haney, Thanks Pablo and good evening again to the board and thanks for having us tonight. Paul Miller- i&#39;m Paul Miller principal at neighbor architects and i&#39;m joined by Curtis puncher from ground Inc, who is the landscape designer. Paul Miller- i&#39;m going to go ahead and share my screen and we&#39;ll start the presentation for one any nine Elm street. Paul Miller- Everybody see my screen again. Paul Miller- Okay, great. Okay, so you can see the site 199 Elm Street highlighted in red towards the bottom of the page. It&#39;s on the east side of Elm Street, sort of at the southern end of Davis Square. You can see Davis Plaza up to the north here, and the Davis Square T stop is right next to that. Christopher McConkey, In the foreground is cutter Plaza. Christopher McConkey, We wanted to just quickly highlight a couple of the planning city planning initiatives, these are both from the Davis square commercial area plan. Christopher McConkey, there&#39;s a thought of making enlarging cutter Plaza and kind of enhancing it and there&#39;s also a thought about reimagining elm street in the core of Davis square as a more pedestrian eyes kind of version of itself. Our block that we&#39;re working on was identified for enhancement in Summer Vision and has been zoned MR4. So we&#39;re excited to be working in this context of this area that&#39;s been identified for enhancement. It&#39;s already, we love Davis Square. I happen to live very close by to here, so it&#39;s an exciting opportunity for us. And just a quick transit and amenities map here in 199 Elm is at the center. Of course, there&#39;s up lots of bus lines close by, the Davis Square T stop, and many amenities in close walking distance. So we feel that this is a terrific site for a transit-oriented development. This is a view of the existing building. It&#39;s an existing two-story building that has been used for commercial space um the existing curb cut we&#39;re proposing to fill in no significant trees will be removed but the existing building will be removed as part of the project and we&#39;ve received permission from the historic commission to to remove it here&#39;s a view looking north on elm street there&#39;s a nice kind of as pablo was hinting at there&#39;s a nice um kind of uh run of restaurants along this side of Elm, Revival Cafe is right next to our site, Doc&#39;s Inn next to that, and then the former Posto, which is relocated to Assembly, unfortunately, is another great commercial space that we expect to see filled sometime soon. Mem Tea is just across the street. Christopher McConkey- And then, this is a view looking the opposite direction on LM you can see our site in the foreground here five on docs and. Christopher McConkey- So this is our proposed site plan again it&#39;s an Mr for zoning district we&#39;re proposing a ground floor commercial space of about 1700 square feet, which we feel will create. Christopher McConkey- A. an active streetscape and a real sense of place here, kind of building off of what Revival and DocCenter are already making with their great little courtyard space between those two restaurants. We&#39;re proposing three levels of apartments above the commercial space, which will be 10 units total. Those will all be group one accessible units, adding much needed accessible housing to the city stock housing. Christopher McConkey, The building will be about 15,000 gross square feet and four stories tall we&#39;re proposing to new street trees. Christopher McConkey, And a new public to new public by cracks. Christopher McConkey, And as I was already saying this is a transit oriented development there&#39;s no car parking. Christopher McConkey, required or proposed here there&#39;s a large bike room, though, through the residential lobby. Christopher McConkey, which provides long term bike parking for residents. Another important feature of this project is that it will need an electrical transformer, and these are a real challenge on a relatively tight site like ours here. This is a 42-foot wide site, give or take a couple of inches. We want to have a generous commercial storefront, and we need to provide access to the residential apartments. We really didn&#39;t want to have the transformer in the facade. It&#39;s a Christopher McConkey- it&#39;s a disruption to the streetscape, and so it was important to us to find a place to put it on the site. Christopher McConkey- And so, for that reason, and also because revival has this really wonderful mural which will show in a minute on the north facade of their building. Christopher McConkey- And a couple of windows in that facade we wanted to step the building back and create a little courtyard. which you&#39;ll see in the renderings that provides access to the building and helps create a sense of place again like kind of building off what revival already has on the northern face of their building um we were you can actually see that mural in the lower right here with the elephant and the flowers and that window will be this window on the lower right will be kind of off of our courtyard now so we&#39;re able to preserve the light into cafe on that side. We love these murals along Elm Street. We think that they&#39;re kind of the most prominent and our favorite architectural feature of this area. So we in our design, we&#39;re interested in kind of building off of the energy that these have and the color. And we also want to make sure that we&#39;re tying into the context of Davis Square. You see a lot of brick, a lot of masonry, and of course these kind of small to mid-size commercial spaces that everybody loves throughout Davis Square. Okay, so here&#39;s a view of our proposed design from Elm Street. You can see we&#39;re picking up on the elevation of Revival next door. That continues down to Dachshund and Posto as well. So there&#39;s a clear kind of ground story band here that is the commercial space primarily. We&#39;re showing it with folding windows so that it can open up in fair weather like you see in some places in Davis. Revival has folding windows. If you go down to Diesel Cafe, they have roll-up garage doors, and it&#39;s just so lovely in the limited time of year when it is fair weather to be able to open these up. You can see, we&#39;ll have a close-up in a minute, but that small entry courtyard where there&#39;s a door both to the Christopher McConkey, The commercial space and the residential lobby. Christopher McConkey, And let&#39;s see so above that ground floor we&#39;re proposing three floors of residential apartments, you can see that the building steps twice more at those upper floors to create space for balconies. Christopher McConkey, That feel kind of distinct from each other and that&#39;s so that&#39;s one balcony per front facing unit. The material palette, we are proposing precast concrete at the base, which would be a kind of charcoal color similar to what you see in Revival. And we feel like that complements the buff colored brick above, which recalls what you see at the Somerville Theater and elsewhere throughout Davis Square. There&#39;s a close up there of the ground floor restaurant and the entry courtyard. And we have views, each of these with windows open and closed. This is a view looking across Elm Street, kind of on the oblique, to describe another important design move, which are the stair towers. We wanted to use those to break down the massing a bit and kind of describe what&#39;s happening on the inside of the building. So we were clouding those in a bright blue glazed brick. um which we feel like is a nice compliment to the warmer buff colored brick that&#39;s part of the main massing and that that move also makes the kind of breaks the scale of the building down more to a human scale where you can see the size of the apartments on the outside of the building i&#39;ll also point out the uh the special permit for the um Christopher McConkey- I believe it&#39;s describes the mechanical penthouse in the zoning code that&#39;s actually the elevator bulkhead and the reason that we need that is because this needs a commercial elevator to meet the code. Christopher McConkey- we&#39;re proposing a really beautiful roof deck that has it&#39;s a green roof and also amenity space and we&#39;re required by code to provide accessible access to that, and that means an elevator. If we&#39;re going to have a roof deck that&#39;s occupiable, the elevator has to go up. And this is the minimum height of an elevator going to that level. It&#39;s about 15 feet above the roof deck. So we&#39;ve tried to hold it kind of as low as we can. But again, if we&#39;re going to have this rooftop amenity, then the elevator just needs to be that tall. This is a view looking kind of south on Elm Street. You can see the other stair tower here. These are existing trees to remain, but just so everyone can see what&#39;s behind there, it&#39;s a lot line wall, so we can&#39;t have any windows, but we are trying to make it as elegant and interesting as we can for the time that it is exposed until the adjacent sites are redeveloped. And then just ending with a close-up view of the courtyard. I think this was the first move in the project, solving for the infrastructure and for this really nice neighboring condition. And I think it really pointed us in a good direction, a strong direction, and informed the design moves that came after. All right, a couple more views here. Paul Haney, And then i&#39;m going to hand it over to curtis. Paul Haney, Okay curtis. Paul Haney, i&#39;ll let you describe the landscape design.</td>

Curt Brown, i&#39;m. so as as paul mentioned um we do have uh two street trees on on elm street um there are overhead wires on this part of the street so we have selected hedge maple which are on the city of somerville&#39;s recommended species list for this condition um inbound of the sidewalk we do have permeable pavers They are not permeable because it&#39;s fairly emitted space. And where there is a setback, we are over that aforementioned transformer vault. We do have permeable pavers in the back of the site where there&#39;s a somewhat generous patio for the ground floor tenant, ideally a restaurant. And, you know, The tenant will have a big say in how that site is furnished, but we would like to see planters out there. Those planters would not count towards our green score. Next slide. Our green score is wholly, well, aside from the permeable pavers, the planting portion of our green score is provided for by the rooftop planting. As Paul mentioned, it&#39;s a pretty nice space up here. A mix of sort of private spaces as well as a more communal space sort of mid-deck on the north. There are two grills there. There&#39;s sinks there and a sort of harvest table. around the perimeter it is a 10 inch soil depth and 100 native species um sort of perimeter planting and then inbound of that you&#39;ll see a sort of darker green um those are planters so those will be 24 inches high um or foot Sorry 42 inches high, because they will be acting also as a guardrail. And they will be vegetable planters available for use by the occupants of the building. The rest of the deck is is pretty flexible furniture wise it is it&#39;ll be wood decking pedestal mounted. um.</td>

We don&#39;t have any rooftop HVAC equipment because we&#39;re using an integrated heat pump, which has what would traditionally be the outdoor equipment integrated with the internal vertical stack. And so it vents through the facade and allows us to have a kind of fully planted and kind of amenity roof rather than having the rooftop equipment.</td>

And then our final slide here is just a look at that green score again. I think our target was 0.3, and we&#39;ve achieved 0.357, I believe. And again, that is achieved through the permeable paving on the patio at the back of the site. That 10 inch soil depth growing medium for the rooftop and a good portion of our species will grow to at least two feet tall. And that&#39;s all for me unless anyone else has questions on that.</td>

What did want to talk quickly about the unit? The units in the building, we have two two bedrooms, three one bedrooms, and three studios. Two of those are going to be affordable, one studio and one one bedroom. We I personally I&#39;m I&#39;m still excited to try to get a site where we can do three bedroom units. I know the city needs that those a lot. Actually, Paul and I had discussions trying to see if we could do that in this site. It was just impossible to make that work from our point of view. I mean, I&#39;m looking forward to the conversation, but it was something that we thought a lot about and we try to approach these really thinking about a mix of. I also want to point out that we&#39;ve decided to not bring gas into the building. We are going to design, you know, everything thinking about a future tenant for a restaurant, but of course we can&#39;t control that. So we want to have that flexibility. But after talking with consultants and kind of seeing where the future is heading in terms of restaurants and the state and, you know, energy and all that, we are going to not bring gas. I just wanted to bring those two points. Thank you.</td>

                <td> unmuted on our end uh you just need to unmute on your end hello can you hear me yes we can hi um yeah so i sent an email today um with three concerns um really the main one is is the story on on trash storage i&#39;m a neighbor um my name is david hossack I live at 16 Wyndham Street, which is on the block. And we have rats. We have already existing restaurants and trash storage outside. And 10 more units plus potentially a restaurant, trash storages are a concern to me. It has Steve Tombson, Somewhere in there, I think it&#39;s actually the transit thing it sees like trash that can be stored in the basement and building management will bring it up. Steve Tombson, All I want to say to that is like that&#39;s great i&#39;d like it written into like I don&#39;t know how this is done, but make that binding that the trash is stored internally and not in the not commercial patio. Steve Tombson, Or the passageway. Steve Tombson, cannot be done, I don&#39;t know. Steve Tombson, My other concern was just the same thing with parking. I want the parking thing to be definitely, there&#39;s no parking being provided, parking permits not to be issued to tenants. And then what was my other one? I can&#39;t really remember. The main one was the trash. Oh yeah, my other point was I sigh at seeing, this is as much the planning board as anything. We have a bunch of limits And, you know, we make decisions, we buy property or whatever, we make our plans on, you know, like looking at what the setbacks and the height restrictions are. And, you know, like, oh, we need an elevator. I just sigh that, you know, this is a routine thing that seems to be routine to me that, you know, you&#39;re going to give like permission to exceed like a height restriction at the edge of the property, near enough at the edge of the property. It&#39;s frustrating. because you know that&#39;s probably great news for the immediate neighbor who can then develop and and that sets precedent and it&#39;s less great news for me because like you know then when that happens then like you know it affects like um you understand my lowly like um two and a half floor house um anyway i decide that that kind of thing i know it&#39;s inevitable um to be honest um so my main concern is is to do with the trash thank you</td>

That&#39;s where it needs to go on this project, both for commercial and residential. And this is going to be a passive house certified building, which means it is super tight. There are no rats getting into the basement to uh, pull trash out. Um, and so, you know, we&#39;ve, we&#39;re doing what we can, um, from a building design perspective to solve for the rat problem. Um, and then to Crystal&#39;s question, group one accessible refers to an adaptable unit. Um, in Massachusetts, there are two levels of accessibility, uh, group one, which means adaptable. It does still require a fully accessible entrance. Um, Christopher McConkey- You know wheelchair turning space inside but kitchens and bathrooms are not what you would. Christopher McConkey- You would deem kind of day one fully accessible, they can be modified, though they&#39;re designed dimensionally to be modified to be fully accessible, where you could say, for instance. Christopher McConkey- or wheelchair underneath the sink and things like that group to accessibility is required for a building with 20 or more units. Paul Cecala, CA OSDS, 5% of the units are required, I believe in a building with 20 or more units and those are fully accessible from the first day so it&#39;s a question of adaptability versus built on day one, hopefully that answers the question.</td>

And I say that, which leads me to my question, and you answered it in part, but I want to push a little bit. When you show the whole building on either side, it&#39;s just blank walls. um and uh paul i think you said at some point into seat blank wall right there and then it&#39;s also on the other side now the other side you said at some point in time somebody may um you know build there um that&#39;s the expectation and that may happen um when this building is done that may happen in 10 or 15 years we we don&#39;t know So, given how much you emphasized the mural art on Davis Square, and particularly within this stretch of Elm, I&#39;m wondering if you have any plans or could you have some plans to commission a mural on one or both walls as a temporary use, because it&#39;s unlikely that this particular wall that you&#39;re seeing actually is revival is going to go up. I mean, let&#39;s hope revival stays there and yes, it should be bigger, but we&#39;re just going to park that for a moment, but certainly on the other wall. So what about doing some public art here?</td>

Like when I saw that building go on the market, this is sort of almost the best outcome I can imagine conceiving for that site. So thank you guys for a project that is, I think, really thoughtful and tasteful and contextual. I have a couple of really nitpicky points because I definitely will be here at the next meeting. So please Please take these with a grain of salt for consideration. I expect other board members to potentially raise the concern about the unit mix and push a little bit harder on it. And I&#39;ll just go ahead and put out there, sometimes when we&#39;ve been unable to come to a unit mix that included any larger units, we have had applicants then do at least one of the affordable units as a Group 2 accessible unit. And I don&#39;t know whether that&#39;s something that we might consider here if the group goes down that path. So I wanted to just raise that and put that out there in the first place. I&#39;m wondering on just an aesthetic question, whether you have, I saw the BUDC, this was their preferred option. I&#39;m sure there were sort of a lot of variables there. have you considered putting any kind of detail sort of to define the cornice line like it&#39;s it&#39;s a beautiful building and i think it&#39;s really great and contextual in many respects but i would be just personally very curious to see even like a very light level of detail there to sort of just cap it off and make it a tiny bit more contextual so i wonder if that&#39;s something you&#39;ve looked at or would consider looking at um i would again ask the chair if we might consider condition on materials approval um Amanda Solliday- limited to the accent color for the stair tower I think it&#39;s a beautiful concept and I just want to make sure that it&#39;s sort of executed in the way that it&#39;s shown here. Amanda Solliday- And then last most important question is, I saw that in the sustainability report at the time that was submitted in March, it looked like there was not yet alignment with ever source. Amanda Solliday- On the feasibility of the underground transformers and to your point that is a very sensitive piece of infrastructure in it important. Amanda Solliday- You know design feature in a way you&#39;ve looked at the facade. Do you have confirmation from Eversource at this point that they&#39;ll allow that to be underground here, or where does that conversation stand?</td>

So I would just like to second my concern with the Eversource thing and definitely would like some type of ability to review the project again if that assumption fails. I&#39;m sure you picked a really great consultant there, but I think that kind of can have some pretty big impacts to the project if that assumption goes away. Um, I second Amelia&#39;s idea of making sure that&#39;s a requirement. Um, I also, uh, had some concerns around unit mix. Uh, clearly your team has listened to a lot of our meetings in the past. So I, I think I&#39;d second Amelia&#39;s creativity here. If, if there&#39;s really no way we can get to a three bedroom, I definitely would like to see some, uh, flexibility on accessibility being combined with affordability. And then on the positive side, I also really appreciate that you guys have thought about the use of gas and Somerville&#39;s goals here for... going toward a carbon free community. I know when we were considering a lot of net zero policies, one of the big pushbacks that came along was restaurant considerations. And the fact that you guys are kind of being proactive about this and saying, hey, I think there&#39;s a market of restaurants and the like that don&#39;t need this, I think is Awesome. So way to kind of lead the charge on this. I think the city should take note of this because, again, this was something that was a big pushback when they were going through their initial drafting of those ordinances. So good on you for all that. And thank you for answering the trash questions as well. I always appreciate you making sure that you&#39;ve got, it&#39;s going to sound like a terrible pun, wasn&#39;t intended, an airtight answer to a problem like a trash mitigation of rats. So thank you.</td>

And early on, we had talked about potentially seeing if this was a site to incorporate a business like that, that I think, you know, I know the gym around the corner opened up, but I think that we, our studio kind of fulfills a different niche. And so that was one, that is one use that we thought about. We actually explored various options about including the basement. And then it just became a little too kind of overwhelming and kind of silly. And we were trying to have a balance between the resident and the commercial. So I think there could be a version of that. I think our, again, I don&#39;t want to make this about us, but that is something that we&#39;ve thought about. But something similar to that type of business, I think, could work really well here. Chair Max Fennell, Personally, I wouldn&#39;t you know I think retail is not so successful. Chair Max Fennell, I feel like something that speaks to the neighbors in the context and but you know I, what do I know I don&#39;t I i&#39;m more going from the heart there, but yes we&#39;ve talked we&#39;ve talked about that if restaurants weren&#39;t something that worked.</td>
