</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Public Testimony (Support):</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Crystal Huff (Ward 5):</strong> Expressed excitement for the project, appreciating accessibility, compatibility with the street, exceeding green score minimums, and the all-electric design (no gas pipes). Inquired about the definition of "Group 1 accessible."</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Public Testimony (Opposition/Concern):</strong><ul>
<li><strong>David Hossack (16 Wyndham Street):</strong> Raised concerns about trash storage, citing existing rat problems from nearby restaurants. Requested a binding condition for internal trash storage in the basement, not in commercial patios or passageways. Also expressed concern about the lack of parking and requested a condition prohibiting parking permits for tenants. Sighed at the routine granting of height variances, noting its impact on neighbors and setting precedent.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Applicant Response to Public Testimony:</strong><ul>
<li>Paul Miller confirmed commitment to basement trash storage for both commercial and residential, noting the passive house certification would prevent rats.</li>
<li>Paul Miller clarified "Group 1 accessible" as an adaptable unit, requiring a fully accessible entrance and wheelchair turning space, with kitchens/bathrooms designed for future modification to full accessibility. Group 2 accessibility is for buildings with 20+ units (5% fully accessible from day one).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Board Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li>Lynn Richards praised the design of the entrance and its compatibility with Revival Cafe's mural. Suggested commissioning a mural for the blank side walls, especially the one not adjacent to Revival, as a temporary public art installation.</li>
<li>Amelia Aboff commended the thoughtful and tasteful design. Suggested considering a Group 2 accessible unit for one of the affordable units if larger units are not feasible. Inquired about adding a cornice detail to the building to cap it off and make it more contextual. Requested a condition for materials approval, specifically for the accent color of the stair tower. Inquired about Eversource confirmation for underground transformers, noting it was a sensitive piece of infrastructure.</li>
<li>Michael McNeely seconded concerns about the Eversource transformer assumption and requested a review if it fails. Seconded Amelia's suggestion for combining accessibility with affordability for unit mix. Praised the all-electric design and proactive approach to a carbon-free community, noting it addresses previous restaurant-related pushbacks on net-zero policies. Appreciated the "airtight" answer to rat mitigation.</li>
<li>Jahan Habib supported the restaurant consideration but asked if the applicant had considered other commercial uses if a restaurant doesn't pan out. Pablo Picker mentioned a yoga studio as a potential alternative, emphasizing a business that speaks to the neighbors and context.</li>
<li>Chairman Capuano noted that the residential parking sticker prohibition condition should be added, similar to the previous application.</li>
<li>The Board requested the applicant return with options for defining the top of the building and a condition for a mural.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Motion:</strong> Chairman Michael Capuano moved to continue this agenda item to the August 21st meeting.</li>
<li><strong>Second:</strong> Amelia Aboff.</li>

</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="6-other-business">6. Other Business</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong> Steve Carey (Staff) proposed adding an "Other Business" item to future Planning Board agendas to provide a formal opportunity for Board members to ask questions of staff or each other regarding board administration, not related to specific projects or applications. This formalizes an informal practice.</li>
<li><strong>Outcome:</strong> The Board agreed to incorporate this as a standing agenda item.</li>
</ul>
