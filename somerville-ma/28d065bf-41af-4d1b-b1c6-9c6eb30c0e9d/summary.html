<ul>
<li><strong>Applicant:</strong> Pablo Picker (Owner/Developer), Paul Miller (Principal, Neighbor Architects), Curtis Puncher (Landscape Architect, Ground Inc.).</li>
<li><strong>Project Description:</strong> Development of a three-unit apartment building in the MR3 zoning district. The building is three stories and approximately 3,600 gross square feet.</li>
<li><strong>Key Features:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Integrated ramp from Pearl Street for zero-step entrance. Ground floor unit is a two-level duplex with a lift for accessibility between levels. Second and third-floor units are walk-up.</li>
<li><strong>Materials:</strong> Primary cladding is aluminum panel (silversmith color), triangular profile (contemporary interpretation of clapboard siding). Mint green color for balcony spaces. Red brick cladding on planters and site walls. Copper-colored metal panel accent at entry.</li>
<li><strong>Landscape:</strong> 100% native trees, shrubs, grasses, and perennials. Permeable paving throughout the site. One white oak street tree added on Pearl Street.</li>
<li><strong>Green Score:</strong> Achieved a score of 0.33 against a target of 0.3.</li>
<li><strong>Sustainability:</strong> All-electric building.</li>
<li><strong>Unit Mix:</strong> All three units are two-bedroom units.</li>
<li><strong>Parking:</strong> No parking provided.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Councilor Aboff inquired about interior unit accessibility. Paul Miller confirmed the ground-floor unit has a lift, while upper units are walk-up.</li>
<li><strong>Parking Stickers:</strong> Councilor McNeely raised the issue of residential parking stickers for projects without parking. Madison Anthony (Staff) noted it was not a standard condition in the memo but supported its addition.<ul>
<li><strong>Proposed Condition:</strong> Prohibition of residential parking stickers for tenants.</li>
<li><strong>Applicant Response:</strong> Pablo Picker stated the design emphasized interior bike parking for residents who would not have cars, aligning with the no-parking assumption.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Material Samples:</strong> Councilor Aboff suggested a condition for the submission of final material samples, including color samples, to planning staff for review before construction. This was supported by the Board.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Public Testimony:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Support:</strong> Crystal Huff (Ward 5) expressed excitement for the project, appreciating accessibility, compatibility, green score, and the absence of gas pipes. She inquired about the definition of "Group One accessible."<ul>
<li><strong>Applicant Response:</strong> Paul Miller clarified "Group One accessible" refers to an adaptable unit, requiring a fully accessible entrance and wheelchair turning space, with kitchens and bathrooms designed to be modified for full accessibility. Group Two accessibility (fully accessible from day one) is required for buildings with 20 or more units (5% of units).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Opposition/Concern:</strong> David Hossack (16 Wyndham Street) raised three concerns:<ul>
<li><strong>Trash Storage:</strong> Primary concern was rat mitigation due to existing restaurants and trash storage. He requested a binding condition for internal trash storage in the basement.</li>
<li><strong>Parking Permits:</strong> Reiterated the need for a condition prohibiting parking permits for tenants.</li>
<li><strong>Height Exceedance:</strong> Expressed frustration with routine height restriction exceptions, particularly for mechanical penthouses, citing precedent-setting implications for neighbors.</li>
<li><strong>Applicant Response:</strong> Paul Miller confirmed commitment to basement trash storage for both commercial and residential, noting the passive house design would prevent rats.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Action 1 (Site Plan Approval):</strong> Approved with conditions as amended in the staff memorandum and discussed tonight.<ul>

<li><strong>Commercial Space:</strong> Designed with folding windows to open in fair weather.</li>

<li><strong>Parking:</strong> No car parking proposed. Large bike room for long-term bike parking.</li>
<li><strong>Materials:</strong> Precast concrete at base (charcoal color), buff-colored brick above. Bright blue glazed brick for stair towers.</li>
<li><strong>Transformer:</strong> Underground transformer proposed, requiring a step-back and courtyard.</li>

<li><strong>Roof Deck:</strong> Green roof with amenity space, including private and communal areas, two grills, sinks, harvest table, and vegetable planters (42 inches high, acting as guardrail). 10-inch soil depth for perimeter planting (100% native species). No rooftop HVAC equipment due to integrated heat pump.</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Design Appreciation:</strong> Councilor Richards praised the design of the entrance and its integration with Revival Cafe's mural, calling it "exquisitely done."</li>
<li><strong>Blank Walls/Public Art:</strong> Councilor Richards inquired about plans for murals on the blank side walls, given the emphasis on Davis Square's mural art.<ul>
<li><strong>Applicant Response:</strong> Pablo Picker and Paul Miller acknowledged the discussion, noting the initial design considered future development of adjacent MR4 zoned properties. They expressed openness to commissioning a mural as a temporary use, especially for the Revival Cafe side.</li>
<li><strong>Board Consensus:</strong> The Board supported a condition for public art (mural) on one or both blank walls.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Unit Mix/Accessibility:</strong> Councilor Aboff acknowledged the thoughtful design but raised concerns about the unit mix, suggesting that if larger units (e.g., 3-bedroom) are not feasible, at least one of the affordable units could be a Group Two accessible unit.</li>
<li><strong>Cornice Detail:</strong> Councilor Aboff suggested considering a detail to define the cornice line for aesthetic and contextual reasons.<ul>
<li><strong>Applicant Response:</strong> Paul Miller was open to considering a minimal detail, such as soldier course brick, to complement the building's spirit and Davis Square context.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Material Approval:</strong> Councilor Aboff requested a condition for material approval, specifically for the accent color of the stair tower.</li>
<li><strong>Eversource Transformer:</strong> Councilor Aboff inquired about confirmation from Eversource regarding the feasibility of the underground transformer, given its critical role in the design.<ul>
<li><strong>Applicant Response:</strong> Pablo Picker stated discussions with their MEPFP engineer (Zade Engineering) indicated feasibility, but a work order had not yet been submitted to Eversource.</li>
<li><strong>Staff Response:</strong> Madison Anthony confirmed that if transformer plans changed, it would likely require a plan revision to the Board.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Gas-Free Building:</strong> Councilor McNeely commended the applicant for proactively designing a gas-free building, especially considering potential restaurant use, aligning with Somerville's carbon-free goals.</li>
<li><strong>Trash Mitigation:</strong> Councilor McNeely appreciated the "airtight answer" to rat mitigation through internal basement trash storage.</li>
