<li>
<p><strong>25-1044: Condo Conversion Ordinance Amendment (Tenant Displacement &amp; Relocation Payments):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Subject:</strong> Proposed amendment to sections 7-64 and 7-65 of the code of ordinances to reduce tenant displacement and update relocation payments related to condo conversions.</li>
<li><strong>Presenters:</strong> Dr. Alan Schachter (Office of Housing and Sustainability), Morena Salaya (Housing Policy Coordinator), Brendan Salisbury (Legislative and Policy Analyst), Director Singh.</li>
<li><strong>Key Proposals:</strong><ul>
<li>Increase relocation payments: \$14,000 for tenants not entitled to enhanced protections, \$18,000 for those who are (seniors, disabled, low/moderate income).</li>
<li>Extend notice period for vacant units that were formerly rentals from one year to two years.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Rationale:</strong><ul>
<li>Address the issue of tenants being displaced <em>before</em> a condo conversion is formally initiated (e.g., leases not renewed, units vacated for sale).</li>
<li>Hoping to change the financial incentives for developers to keep tenants in place.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Concerns Raised:</strong><ul>
<li>Potential for litigation.</li>
<li>Impact on the cost of condo development.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Discussion Highlights:</strong><ul>
<li>Councillor Yuancampon sought clarification on how the changes would prevent "secret" evictions.</li>
<li>Councillor Strison inquired about incentivizing Section 8 participation during the waiting period (deemed out of scope for this specific amendment).</li>
<li>Councillor Scott emphasized the collaborative nature of the working group and the simple nature of the changes.</li>
<li>Discussion about the effective date of the amendment (October 1st proposed).</li>
<li>Brendan Salisbury cautioned against adding an effective date on the fly due to drafting complexities.</li>

<p><strong>24-0256: Mopeds on Community Path (Boston Ordinance):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Subject:</strong> Discuss whether elements of Boston's proposed ordinance for road safety and accountability for delivery providers could be used to disincentivize mopeds on the community path.</li>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li>Brendan Salisbury noted that the Boston ordinance primarily addresses insurance for delivery drivers, not necessarily moped use on paths.</li>
<li>City Attorney Amara clarified that the community path land is owned by the MBTA, and the lease prohibits motorized vehicles (though e-bikes are allowed by state statute).</li>
<li>Discussion about signage clarity (what constitutes a "motorized vehicle").</li>
<li>Councillor Chazza suggested temporary sandwich board signage.</li>
<li>Councillor Scott requested a citation on the definition of "motorized vehicles" and offered to review the community path lease.</li>
