            All right, good evening, everyone. This is a meeting of the Committee on Legislative Matters. I am Lance Davis, Servinist Chair. I use he-him pronouns. Presumably chapter two of the acts of 2025, this meeting of the City Council Committee on Legislative Matters, is being conducted via remote participation. So that means we'll post an audio recording, an audio video recording, transcript, or other comprehensive records of all these proceedings as soon as possible after the meeting on the City of Summerville website.

            All right, very well. Thank you. So that takes us to item number two, which is 25-1044 requesting ordainment of an amendment to section 7-64 and 7-65 of the code of ordinances to reduce displacement of tenants and update relocation payments. This is our so-called condo conversion ordinance that has been in place for quite a long time actually. There was a significant

            update made a few years back, and then I think maybe another tweak or two along the way. And this was requested to address sort of continued challenges with folks being displaced, particularly when there was a sale of a property prior to a

            condo conversion. So I know that we are joined this evening by Dr. Alan Schachter from the Office of Housing and Sustainability as well as always by Brendan Salisbury, our legislative and policy analyst. Brendan, do you have anything you want to

            Discuss with us or introduce to us in this or show a director shactor or you who wants to take the lead and sort of explain what we're able to come up with to try and help folks be able to stay in their homes.

            Mr. Chair, I do just want to highlight as I have become in the habit of doing that this was a really excellent work of collaboration with administrative staff. That being said, I am not inclined to steal Director Shactor's thunder. So if the director of IGA was inclined to say that the Director Shactor was available to speak on it, I'm very happy to see.

            I get you anticipated by next move, which was to ask Director Singh, is that there, are you going to Director Shactor here for this one? Through the chair, Director Shactor, along with our Housing Council and Housing Policy Coordinator is available tonight to present this item and answer any question. If I could request the clerks to pull up the slides that were sent to the committee yesterday, that would be great. And with that, I'll give it a word to Director Shactor.

            All right, very well, Dr. Schecto, would you just introduce yourself for the record? Not that we don't all know and love you and your work and all your staff as well. And you have the floor. Well, thank you very much to the chair and to the committee. This is going Marena's Elias policy staff for the housing division is gonna lead us off.

I am housing policy coordinator and I am also staff to the Condor Review Board. Excuse me. So tonight we're going to be speaking to you about the recommendations resulting from the work of the Anti-Dispacement Task Force and the Condor Organist Working Group that was convened earlier this year.

            Oh, so first I'd like to start off by thanking the working group members, which included Councillor Scott, two members of the Condor Review Board, our vice chair, Kate Byrne, and our alternate member, Jennifer Solis, Brendan, Ellen, Joe, and I were also staff. And as Brendan said earlier, it was a very collaborative effort, and I'm, I'm,

            proud of the effort that we put into it and sort of the thoughtfulness that everyone brought to the table and think that we've got hopefully some good recommendations for you all. Next slide, please.
        </div>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="320.707" data-end="349.04">

            So tonight we're gonna be proposing to separate changes to the ordinance. This is gonna relate to the permits that are issued for units that were currently rented or the last use was as rentals. So this is going to, the proposed ordinance changes are an extended notice period for vacant units that were last used as rentals and increased relocation payments for any current tenants who are living in units while conversion is occurring. Next slide, please.
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="350.39" data-end="373.745">
            <span class="timestamp"><a href="https://somervillema.granicus.com/player/clip/2713?autoplay=1&entrytime=350" class="timestamp-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[05:50]</a></span>
            So just to give a quick overview of the condo ordinance, so people have the background. Like I mentioned earlier, we've got two sort of tenets, two types of permits that we issue, that the board issues, a rental conversion permit and a non-rental conversion permit. Non-rental conversion permits are permits issued for owner occupied units or units that were formerly owner occupied or things where
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="374.048" data-end="397.083">
            <span class="timestamp"><a href="https://somervillema.granicus.com/player/clip/2713?autoplay=1&entrytime=374" class="timestamp-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[06:14]</a></span>
            Yeah, that's basically what it is. So we're not really going to touch those because we're not making any changes for that. We're solely dealing with tenant or formerly tenant units. For currently tenant units, the process is generally that owners must serve tenants with a written notice on a form provided by the board. The notice period for tenants begins as of receiving that notice of intent form.
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="397.083" data-end="418.345">
            <span class="timestamp"><a href="https://somervillema.granicus.com/player/clip/2713?autoplay=1&entrytime=397" class="timestamp-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[06:37]</a></span>
            They're the tenants protections however best when an owner forms an intent and so intent plays a big role in the ordinance. And so that can be a different date than from when they get the form because the owner decides that they're going to convert before they actually start collecting all of the forms that they've got to provide to the tenants.
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="418.345" data-end="439.355">
            <span class="timestamp"><a href="https://somervillema.granicus.com/player/clip/2713?autoplay=1&entrytime=418" class="timestamp-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[06:58]</a></span>
            So when tenants protections best, they are entitled to a one year or five year notice period or right to purchase their unit for the as is price of the unit or relocation payment if they vacate within their notice period and the current amounts are on the screen there. And they've got a right to actually cancel their lease or move out with 30 days notice to their tenants.
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="439.355" data-end="462.625">
            <span class="timestamp"><a href="https://somervillema.granicus.com/player/clip/2713?autoplay=1&entrytime=439" class="timestamp-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[07:19]</a></span>
            Now, if you've got vacant units where the last use was rental, then owners have to notify those tenants that had lived there within the previous 12 months. And they receive a written notice, just a letter, nothing that's on a board form or anything. And then the one year notice period in that case begins when the board issues a preliminary permit.
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="462.625" data-end="478.42">
            <span class="timestamp"><a href="https://somervillema.granicus.com/player/clip/2713?autoplay=1&entrytime=462" class="timestamp-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[07:42]</a></span>
            And just to be clear, the notice period is a waiting period. So you get a preliminary permit and then you have to wait for however long that notice period is before you can get a final permit. And then you're not able to sell your units until you've got that final permit. So next slide, please.
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="480.007" data-end="507.277">
            <span class="timestamp"><a href="https://somervillema.granicus.com/player/clip/2713?autoplay=1&entrytime=480" class="timestamp-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[08:00]</a></span>
            So the main issue that we've come across is that the condo conversion laws generally protect current tenants. So as I mentioned earlier, the ordinance is triggered when the owner has an intent to convert. So this is difficult to establish. They often seek to maximize their profits from sales, but just because you've vacated a unit or a building in order to sell it, that doesn't mean that they're
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="507.277" data-end="513.537">
            <span class="timestamp"><a href="https://somervillema.granicus.com/player/clip/2713?autoplay=1&entrytime=507" class="timestamp-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[08:27]</a></span>
            is or is not an intent to convert. So the problem, the hard part that the board has is trying to establish that intent.
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="514.347" data-end="542.461">
            <span class="timestamp"><a href="https://somervillema.granicus.com/player/clip/2713?autoplay=1&entrytime=514" class="timestamp-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[08:34]</a></span>
            So what happens is an original owner decides to sell the original owner opts not to renew a tenant's leases, and then a purchase and sale will frequently require that the units be vacant at the time of closing. And then the new owner has an intent to convert. And so there's one year notice period to the board, but there's no tenant protections because the ordinance is treating this as a vacant unit. These tenants have been displaced.
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="542.461" data-end="544.908">
            <span class="timestamp"><a href="https://somervillema.granicus.com/player/clip/2713?autoplay=1&entrytime=542" class="timestamp-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[09:02]</a></span>
            Next slide, please.
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="545.65" data-end="575.502">
            <span class="timestamp"><a href="https://somervillema.granicus.com/player/clip/2713?autoplay=1&entrytime=545" class="timestamp-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[09:05]</a></span>
            So what we are proposing to proposals before eight tonight, as I said earlier, the relocation payments, we are proposing for those to be increased to $14,000 for tenants that are not entitled to enhance protections and $18,000 for those that are. So those would be seniors, disabled tenants, or load or moderate income tenants. And then the second proposal is changing the notice period for vacant units that were former rentals to
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="575.502" data-end="602.452">
            <span class="timestamp"><a href="https://somervillema.granicus.com/player/clip/2713?autoplay=1&entrytime=575" class="timestamp-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[09:35]</a></span>
            two years instead of one year, which is currently what we've got in place. The goal of which is to encourage property owners to keep their tenants in their units since it would be more beneficial because the tenant notice period is not changing. So if you've got your tenants, they would have generally just the one year. If you've got a vacant unit that was formerly tenanted, then you would have two years. So we're trying to change that calculus. Next slide, please.
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="604.038" data-end="624.187">
            <span class="timestamp"><a href="https://somervillema.granicus.com/player/clip/2713?autoplay=1&entrytime=604" class="timestamp-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[10:04]</a></span>
            So we understand that there are pros and cons to taking the two-year notice period. We talked about them extensively during the working group. And like I said earlier, we thought that it was beneficial. It could be beneficial to keeping the tenant in their units.
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="624.187" data-end="642.85">
            <span class="timestamp"><a href="https://somervillema.granicus.com/player/clip/2713?autoplay=1&entrytime=624" class="timestamp-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[10:24]</a></span>
            It would potentially deter and ding out the properties prior to sale and might change that requirement in the purchase and sale agreements. It would grant greater opportunity for tenants to receive and offer to purchase. Not that many tenants have bought their units through the condo ordinance.
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="642.85" data-end="670.222">

            And then expanded notice period could provide opportunity for for tenant organizing or nonprofit to purchase the property in order to restrict it for affordability. And then if the tenants do vacate, they can do so in a more manageable timeline than what generally occurs, which is, you know, a month's notice that Lisa isn't being renewed or somebody an outwill tenant is just being told that they need to vacate.
        </div>

            The problem or the cons that we were that we identified were tenant properties are hard to sell, which could increase the costs for development of condo units down the line. Some developers may have the funds to keep properties vacant. So that would mean higher housing costs in the end and units that aren't being used.
        </div>

            And we've already got one of the most stringent conversion bylaws in the commonwealth. And so there's always the additional aspect of potential for litigation. Next slide, please.

            And here before you, we've got just some data that we compiled about how often applications came to us, came to the board vacant prior to the 2019 change that added in the one year notice period. So as you can see, we have had it has had an impact, 92% versus 80%. But it's still, you know,

            Summerville does not have a vacancy rate of 80%. So obviously, you know, for the most part, applications are coming before us, still empty and tendons are generally receiving the protections that they're entitled to.

            And additionally, we do have two requests of this committee. We would recommend that the effective date should the amendments be approved. The effective date should be set to October 1st. This will allow staff time to conduct outreach and educate stakeholders on these changes. And then there's also a typo that we'd like to correct within the ordinance

            Section 7-6-4A1A reads a non-tent paying tenant when it should read a non-rent paying tenant. And with that, I think the next slide is just a question slide. All right. Very good. Thank you very much, Ms. Leah. Any questions from members of the committee?

            I'll see you in Kevin. Thank you, Mr. Chair, through you. Thank you so much, Marina, Ellen, everyone who worked on this. I think you forgive me if you kind of just explain this, but if I'm a member of the public following this, can you just explain in like simple terms how these changes make it harder for someone to evict the tenants secretly before applying for the condo conversion or condo conversion?
        </div>

            Through the chair. So it's it's not so much that it makes it harder for tenants to be evicted. We're hoping that we change the math when when folks are deciding if they're going to be evicting or or emptying out their buildings.
        </div>

            We're hoping that by saying, well, tenants would only need to stay for a year versus a two year waiting period, or actually, if a tenant vacates earlier, then you can get your final permit earlier. So we're hoping that the math changes. It's not so much that we can sort of prevent the evictions themselves, unfortunately.

            And just to, you know, because I get a lot of questions about this, I just kind of want to talk through it. I often hear from, you know, members of the public who will attend these condo conversion board meetings like they're concerned, right? And they'll see someone show up and say, yeah, it's vacant. And the condo board often feels, you know, like that they're sort of at the limit of what they can do. How would that situation be changed by this?

            And sorry, church, church, you have your hand up. Did you want to address that or the prior point? Thank you for a moment. Again, this is Ellen Shactor through the chair. I hope this one. Okay, Marina. Wasn't sure how we were supposed to do this, but I guess I would just add a couple of things and to very, very, very right clearly explain the problem.
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="930.468" data-end="959.628">

            The current owner evicts, that current owner may not have any intent one way or the other about what the next owner is going to do, next owner comes in and converts and there's no sitting tenants. What we hope is by having a two year period where that new owner purchases, even if the units are building them by saying they have to wait a full two years before they can convert to condominiums. That a number of things would happen. It would change the financial incentives for developers so that first of all,
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="959.982" data-end="982.578">

            They might decide it's not in their interest to convert at all because it is now more expensive. There's a two year waiting period before they can do that and begin to recoup any of their investment. So there is some disincentive from this to conversion period. The second thing is Marina said that I would just again like to point out is by landlords, new landlords and the old landlords have a choice, right?
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="982.932" data-end="1008.717">

            Sometimes they are communication, sometimes the First Landlord knows that the new buyer intends to convert, that there's conversation about that. But this could create a different kind of incentive so that together it might be more worthwhile for that person, right, to allow that tenant to remain, not to bring that building vacant to us, but to keep that tenant in place and give them that
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="1009.173" data-end="1034.907">

            that one year, or maybe five years, period before they have to relocate. So what this does, we can't control the, we can't prevent the sale from one owner to the other. And we can't change the law to say the new owner is responsible for the old tenants, if the old tenants evicted. But what we can do is try to change the financial incentives that really make

            Um, may make a difference in our ability to get more of these buildings coming to us with tenants in them as opposed to the first landlord automatically.
        </div>
        </p>

            emptying all the buildings in order to sort of get the highest, what they perceive as the highest return on their dollar in that sale, which is typically to develop, develop a vacant, you know, to deliver a vacant building. So we're trying to use this as a way to change some of the financial incentives that underlie the decisions that are being made when people come before the kind of review boards.

            Mr. Chair, thank you. I think that's really, really helpful discussion. I appreciate it. And obviously completely share the goal of slowing down as much as humanly possible, the just like mass scale displacement of people. These are oftentimes long time rental units that are permanently being taken off the market, right? That is not something that I personally think has a ton of

            I'm excited about these changes. I think they're great and I'm very proud that I live in a city that is so well prepared to fight against displacement. And I want to very much commend the work of the Office of Housing Stability and the task force for your vigilance on this. I'm working really hard to try to solve a problem. My question is,

            to Ms. Leah, if I may, Mr. Chair, was there conversations about incentivizing during that waiting period between attempting to squeeze out current residents and the attempt of a cell purchase, et cetera, to
        </div>

            Can we expand the Section 8 stock through incentivizing somewhere in the process, the potential new purchaser of the building to consider maybe one unit or two unit as affordable home ownership or Section 8? Something like that.
        </div>

            What how deep did the anti-displacement task force go on expanding section eight stock and preserving residents that way? Through the chair, so excuse me, I was co-chair of the Residential Displacement Committee for the Anti-Displacement Task Force.
        </div>

            So the work of the task force and the work of this working group were separate. They neither group work together. So I do want to separate the two, even though the two amendments one came from each, I do want to sort of separate their the work. The.

            Anti displacement task force did not look into a way to expand the Section 8 stock. I'm not sure and I'll let Director Shactor speak more clearly on this, but we we did.
        </div>
        </p>

            Look into potential the potentially the use of section eight vouchers in things like our inclusionary units to try to deepen affordability that way things like that, but we didn't.
        </div>
        </p>

            I'm not sure that that we have any control over expanding the stock itself and my understanding and again, director, sector can correct me if I'm wrong is that the vouchers themselves are the voucher program is pretty stretched. So I'm not sure, you know, how much flexibility there is.

            If I... Thank you. So, Councillor Schuss, let me just caution. I appreciate the question. Absolutely. A lot of those recommendations from the task force are definitely things we'd like to see move forward. I'm not sure this is quite on point enough for it to be appropriate for the discussion given the specific amendment we have before us. It's so understood.
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>

            I'm happy to suggest that we take another crack in a separate discussion thread. And if the kind of conversion ordinance is a way to accomplish that or some of the other goals, then I certainly will.
        </div>

            I may or may not be the chair of this committee going forward, but I certainly would support, you know, using that as a tool in a subsequent amendment if there's a way we can do some of those things. The direction I was going with that as it ties in is the incentivizing during that, that, that wiggle period.

            That is where what I was aiming, but yes, we want to stay on topic and don't feel if it makes you feel uncomfortable that we're heading into a different topic. But the goal of point is the incentivizing developers or to do the right thing. Not specifically on the, so I want to clarify, not speaking on the,

            a specific program of Section 8 expansion. That's not the entity I was going to, so I want to clarify that, but the incentivizing through the condo ordinance. And that's fine. We should have another discussion on it, I think, but happy to take that up in another agenda item. And yeah, I was going to ask about litigation, but that's okay. I can go back in the queue or ask a different time. Now, if you have further questions, go ahead.

            Yes. I will caution, as always, when we're talking about litigation, we should be careful what we're discussing, the potentialities we're discussing in an open meeting. Right. And on that, I think I'm okay asking, following up via email or another way for that reason, I was on the fence about it, but that's okay. I can wait. So back in the queue.

            Thank you, not on the substance of the proposal before you. I just wanted to share with the committee that we've received some outreach from constituent and the administration is supportive of keeping the item in committee if that's what the chair decides to allow a community to provide additional feedback before the next legislative matters meeting. Thank you.

            Okay, thank you, Dr. Singh, for that. This was submitted to the council on June 12th. So that's what, two and a half, three and a half weeks ago, two and a half weeks, one, two, about two and a half weeks. You know, I went back and looked, I don't have any emails raising, we are reflecting that request. I think,

            open to the will of the committee, but these are pretty straightforward changes. I'm not sure how much math there is to be done. We haven't actually seen the text changes. Why don't we table that aspect of the discussion for the moment if that's okay and pull up the actual proposed amendment so we can look at the

            you know, the actual language changes that are there being proposed. Councillor Scott, I see your hand up. Is it on that or? We were still in discussion, Mr. Chair. I was just going to. Very well. Then go ahead. All right. Thank you, Mr. Chair.

            I just wanted to, but first, let me put it in a plug for the summer VIP program, I think, which is an actual direct payment to landlords who are willing to get section eight tenants into their units. But on the matter before us, I just want to say that it was incredible to serve with these folks in this working group. Everybody really brought us a feeling of

            wanting to explore every possible venue for improving the ordinance. You know, the co-chair who was there in it is somebody who I'm sure has reached out to, if not all of us, many of us with concerns over the kind of review board and their ability to actually

            exercise or help tenants exercise their rights. So there was, I don't think I can do justice to the breadth of things that were discussed in that committee. But I can say that city staff really did dig in and pursue every wild idea that we could come up with. I'm not sure what the nature of community comment

            is that it was a pretty vague update, Mr. Chair. I don't see this as anything other than a very simple increase of the relocation cost to reflect the actual cost of relocating and an extension which, from a policy perspective, has a chance of making things better. So I'd be inclined to pass these and just get them out of the box, but, you know, will of the chair.

            Thank you very much for your annual. Very well. Thank you, Councillor Scott. Would the clerk be able to put the actual proposed amendment on the screen, or if not, if I'm able to share, I'm happy to do that as well. I think it would be helpful, like I said, just to see the very limited actual text changes that

            You know, that are brought about by this year. Chair Davis, I don't believe I have that at least not easily accessible. If you do, it might be easier if you could share. I think looks like I have to request sharing. I just allow permission. Okay. So let's see. I'm going to share this document.

            All right. So this is the ordinance. Can you all see that now? Is it, is it a reasonable size? We can see it, but I will say you might want to just zoom in a tad bit so we can see the words more clearly. How's that? Perfect. All right. So this is actually the marked up version. So as you can see, no changes.

            for a good bit until we get to 7.64 and this is changing one years to two years. Here is the, excuse me, here's the non-tent pain tenant. I think unless the clerk disagrees, I think that is probably a correction that could be made by the clerk's office without needing to vote. It's fairly clearly just a typo.

            And just for the members of the public, this is actually the documents attached to the item. So folks watching at home can point this up as well. Take a look through the agenda. So here's the second set of changes, as was noted, to 18,000 and 14,000 with the relocation payments. That was it.

            Not one more. There's another change in the one year to two years. Okay. Yeah, so that's it. And I think this is relevant to the discussion here, because in terms of the actual text which changes, it's very limited, very straightforward. It's really just the concept that was presented here.

            So we heard Councillor Scott any other discussion on in terms of moving this forward, but I'll just share about my thought as chair is I'm going to stop sharing here if clerk wants to put the agenda back up. Thank you.

            Look, I appreciate it, and we often have kept things in committee to give folks a chance to review it and take a look. We've been talking about this for many, many, many, many, many months. It was submitted two and a half weeks ago. It won't be taken up by the council for another week and a half.
        </div>
        </p>

            Actually, is it even longer than that? No, it's a week and a half. The 10th, I think, of July is the next council meeting. So certainly if there's an outpouring of concern or substantive issues that are raised, the full council could elect to send it back to committee at that time. But I think there's also the question of the effective date and that request, which I want to come back to, but I'm not sure I see a

        </p>

            compelling argument to hold to hold off any further on based on in terms of what we have for us. Council member Kevin I see your hand raised. Mr. Chair just my two cents on the timing I mean on a certain level we've been wanting to do this for many years and so I'm in a I'm in a hurry in that sense.
        </div>
        </p>

            If there's a motion, I'll be voting for it clearly. The only thing I wanted to say is if we are going to have an effective data box over, and if there is some benefit that I'm not totally understanding of having time for people to try to influence our vote, as long as it's kind of, I think,
        </div>

            hopefully very clear to this staff that this or something extremely close to this will pass when it comes. If that effective day were to stay and we were to pass it in mid August instead of now, there's basically no harm, no foul either way. It's really hard for me to imagine public feedback that's going to change my support for this. So in that sense, I don't want to patronize the public and pretend, right?

            I value the input of this working group is what I'm saying. But, you know, I have certainly been wrong before and if there is some value that I'm missing and it's not going to change the time that this actually goes into effect, you know, it's not the end of the world if we wait until long as to take this up. But again, I'm supportive of these changes.

            Yeah. Okay. Thank you, Councilor and Cabinet. So, I mean, let's talk about that suggestion that there be an effective date of October 1st in order for the administration to undertake some communication about this. I mean, I'm always in the mind that like once we have something that we think is the right way to do it, we should get on it. And I'm not sure
        </div>
        </p>

        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="2102.032" data-end="2126.112">

            I'm not sure. I see the value of, you know, pushing this back so many, so many months given how long we've been, you know, working to try and get something to place here. But, um, I certainly, I see Councillor Scott's hand up and as you were, you know, in the working room, I'd love to hear your thoughts on that of, uh, uh, certainly want to speak to. Thank you, Mr. Chair, uh, on that, um, I,
        </div>

            I don't really have a problem with the effective date being like over if that's what staff feels like they need in order to get appropriate outreach on it.
        </div>
        </p>

            you know, however, I certainly wouldn't want to delay the passage of this. And just for folks who are curious at home, this is simply the legislative matters committee recommending this ordinance update for approval. It would still be up to a full debate by the council and discussion there. As the chair pointed out, if it gets sent back, if there's some very notable objection that's raised, I certainly
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="2163.98" data-end="2192.296">

            I'd be curious, Mr. Chair, if any amendment to the document before us would be necessary to create that effective date, I know 768 has the old effective date of July 31st, 2019. I didn't know if we would have to have a subsequent effective date referencing these amendments. So pretty procedurally, Mr. Chair, what is recommended if we are going to take up that October effective date?
        </div>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="2193.916" data-end="2201.56">

            But all right, thank you, Councillor Scott, for that. Mr. Salisbury, our legislative policy analyst.

            I have a note that you have some thoughts on the effective date. I don't know if they're to the administrative procedures aspect of it, but I'm happy to give you the floor, and here you're put on that issue or the subject of issue. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Let me turn my video on to respect that other people have done so as well, and also prove that I do have a face. For the record, legislative and policy analyst, Brendan Salisbury,
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="2232.661" data-end="2254.683">

            So this has been a thing that has come up before the committee before with regard to the implementation of an effective date on an amendment. And I would like to say that for an amendment such as this in particular, it is extremely difficult to include an effective date. The inclusion of an effective date in the effective date section
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="2254.683" data-end="2277.397">
            <span class="timestamp"><a href="https://somervillema.granicus.com/player/clip/2713?autoplay=1&entrytime=2254" class="timestamp-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[37:34]</a></span>
            notwithstanding my opinion on the use of effective date sections in their entirety, is that if we were to say the amendment of X dates takes effect on X date, we would eventually have an extremely unwieldy and difficult to parse effective date section. With these text changes where they are
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="2277.397" data-end="2306.945">
            <span class="timestamp"><a href="https://somervillema.granicus.com/player/clip/2713?autoplay=1&entrytime=2277" class="timestamp-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[37:57]</a></span>
            As you have noted, very minor text changes within the text. It would be a relatively simple thing to add an effective date if an entire new section was being added or even an entire new subsection, we could say this subsection shall take effect on X date. But where we're literally changing only a few words throughout the entirety of this ordinance, it would become a very difficult exercise to include the change from one to two years in, you know,
        </div>
        </p>

        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="2307.586" data-end="2335.497">

            subsection A of 764 paragraph one takes effect on, you know, October of 2025. So I do want to caution against attempting to make any addition of an effective date on the fly in committee, because it will lead to a bit of a nightmare in terms of drafting. Okay, Mr. Chair, can I follow up on that? Go right ahead, Kaskat. Thank you.

            I really appreciate that. That was my point of concern on the effective date piece of it. Mr. Chair, at the risk of showing my bitter experience, we pass laws all the time that don't get enforced until the administration decides to. I'm thinking of the vacant property ordinance in particular. So if there's an administrative decision to pause the implementation of this until a certain date,

            Let that be so and let that be a choice that the administration. But I've given that I think very compelling explanation there. My inclination whenever you feel it's appropriate is to move to recommend the document before us. Thank you, Mr. Chair.

            Okay, thank you, Councillor Scott. I guess while I certainly understand and appreciate your point, I guess I would reject the premise that I'm comfortable with, not to put words in your mouth, but I certainly wouldn't be comfortable with just allowing that the administration can decide when they want to enforce laws.

            I'd love for them, I'd love for the vacant property ordinance to be enforced at some point ever, and it's many, many years of existence, but alas, here we are. So, but fair point, I think what I'm inclined to suggest at this stage is that that emotion is in order and that between in the ten or so days between now and when the council meets and it's final meeting before the recess,

            you know certainly as always if there are significant concerns that arise that are brought to the council's attention it's always there's always the opportunity to sense on the back to committee and similarly in the meantime if there is a streamlined way without you know

            messing up the batter to add an effective date to this. That's certainly something that we could take up at the meeting on Thursday. I happen to have a close connection with the person who will be presiding over that meeting and I can tell you that it'll keep you willing to allow it. So it's fine with me.

            Other than just wanting to get this in place, if, you know, if there's a significant reason to do that, that's fine, but definitely don't want to mess up things. So, um, I see Councillor, uh, you and Kevin, it's got, um, go. Thank you, Mr. Chair.

            I, at the risk of having a longer conversation we need to, through you, I, with immense respect to our legislative analysts, I just, I don't quite understand why it's impossible to have an effective date for amendments. It's something, you know, it's never been an issue in the past that I'm aware of. I certainly respect that drafting might be less like aesthetically clean or something, but
        </div>
        </p>

            isn't having an effective date for a series of amendments, like a completely de-regor thing that is commonly done in ordinance drafting across the country. Am I misunderstanding something? I mean, I think Councilor Young-Kampon, I guess what I'm suggesting is that if that is in fact the case, which it may well be, I don't see any concern with having that presented to us between now and next Thursday,

            And, you know, rather than trying to sort out what, if there is a, if it is there, and it's done all the time, what that is here tonight, we've got a few other items on the agenda. You know, I think, you know, we could, you know, we could certainly take that up at City Council level. Now, if folks wanted to debate whether or not we should, you know,

            We should delay the effect of this. That's a different discussion, but it sounds like there's a willingness to agree to that request if there's a streamlined way to do it. Councillor Scott, I think that's what I effectively heard you say. You do have your hand up, so have it to give you the floor on that or whatever else you want to add. Thank you, Mr. Chair. No, I think you summarized it quite well. If there is a way to do that, and there's language that can prepare to be the buyer policy analyst or anybody else,

            I'm happy to take that up on the floor in two weeks and have a policy discussion would not be a long one, I think, between our colleagues. But also, like I said, I was open to entertaining it, but I really want to move this out of committee tonight. So, as you said, motion is on. I will move to recommend for approval.

            All right, Councillor Scott, we're most recommended approval of the proposed amendments that is before us. Is there any discussion on the motion? All right. Seeing none, I would the clerk please call the roll. Yep, this is to recommend approval on item number two. Councillor Streza. Yes. Councillor Embaugh.

            to put something before us and I'm really happy to see something that, not only will hopefully make a difference in folks' lives, but has the full sign-off from the law department as being something that we, on which we are on very solid ground, as was said. So again, thank you all for that.

            All right, that brings us to the next item on our agenda, which is 24-1740. This is just a companion item, I believe, that was this is actually the initial discussion, if I'm correct. So I would recommend that we place this one on file, if the clerk would confirm, that's the right disposition of that.

            that I guess it's in order. So yes, maybe it will be work complete. Yes. Very good. All right. Thank you, Clark. All right. So that brings us to item four in the agenda, which is 24-0256 that the city solicitor discussed with this council, whether elements of Boston's proposed ordinance for road safety and accountability for delivery providers could be used to disincentivize moped on the community path. This is apparently the disincentivization meeting tonight.

            So this was a suggestion that was put forth by Council Burnley a little while back, a good while back actually. And I wanted to get it on the agenda so we have a chance to kind of queue up the conversation. I know that there are, I know we have folks in a lot of department here that may be able to speak to some of the questions and issues, but certainly there's no expectation that there's a fully fledged sort of response or proposal here. I wanted to
        </div>
        </p>

        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="2791.038" data-end="2819.405">

            kind of have the discussion on this and then you know it hopes that perhaps over the recess we could you know folks could kind of put pen to paper and when we want to come back at the end of the summer if there is anywhere to any improvements we can make here then maybe have some some concrete suggestions on that so I just want to I want to say that at the outset so there's no you know expectations that we're going to have you know fully fledged response or proposal but

            I just want to get the conversation started, if you will. So with that context in mind, Mr. Salisbury, you mentioned that you have some background or some input that you'd like to share with the committee on this item, is that correct?
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="2837.984" data-end="2855.163">
            <span class="timestamp"><a href="https://somervillema.granicus.com/player/clip/2713?autoplay=1&entrytime=2837" class="timestamp-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[47:17]</a></span>
            To some extent, Mr. Chair, yes. I have, so through you to the committee, I did want to flag just one thing that in review of the ordinance that was passed in Boston, I did want to highlight that while Councillor Burnley's
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="2855.332" data-end="2883.158">

            intent does appear to be about disincentivizing mobility path. It's my opinion that the ordinance that was passed in Boston and that was initially proposed would not accomplish that. The ordinance that was passed and initially proposed in Boston was essentially to establish accountability for all delivery drivers in the event of a crash. So requiring the use of insurance.

            I obviously cannot speak to the legality of that. I know that members of the law department are here and may be able to. But I do have, I've done a glancing analysis of this and I'd be interested to know how things are shaking out in Boston. They do, of course, have a significantly more substantial apparatus in place to make this work. But I'd be very interested to know how this is going in Boston because I

            to be frank, this looks like a logistical nightmare. Okay, very well. Thank you for that. Any question or discussion from the committee? Council Chazo? Thank you.

            Through the chair, it did pass, I believe, in, yes, April 2nd. There were some minor amendments to it, nothing that really substantially changed the thrust of the ordinance, just a few bits of cleaning up the language. But it did pass in its amended form, April 2nd. Thank you. And second is,

            Remind me, again, on the community path, that's Somerville. And are there parts of it that are MBTA owned or, and if so, how exactly would that even be logistically possible for us to enforce a part of the community path that we don't own if we don't own?

            So, Councillor, Mr. Chair, through you to the Councillor, I don't have an answer to that off the top of my head. I do see that City Attorney Amara is on deck, so I'd be happy to defer. Absolutely, thank you, Mr. Osroy. Our City Attorney is here. Senator Amara, welcome if you would just introduce yourself for the record and then happy to hear any thoughts you'd like to share. Hi, I am.

            city attorney, Amara, and I am here to help assist in this. I can tell you the path itself, the land is owned by the MBTA. So there would be a lot of issues about what if anything we could do, particularly unilaterally without MBTA. The good news is we have a lease for the community path with the MBTA. In the lease prohibits motorized vehicles.

            and MoPeds are not currently allowed on the community path. That's my understanding. So I'm not quite sure how the Boston ordinance and what the summer of a goal on the community path meshed together because the Boston ordinance is designed more to deal with insurance for

            delivery services so that when there is a problem or an accident that they're covered or more important than the people that are harmed have coverage that they can go to. Whereas I believe the question about the community path is not wanting to have motorized vehicles. And apparently my understanding is there is also a sign that says new motorized vehicles. That's the extent of my knowledge.

            Okay, thank you, Attorney Amara. We're all going to pause for a minute while we get used to our new but apparently old naming system that we've never realized we'd made the change many years ago. So I think, look, I mean, the language of this, of this item is fairly clear in terms of the intent in terms of

            that, you know, moped, well, some type of motorized vehicle on the community path. There is also some nuance to find and understand it correctly. That and the letter, the Boston ordinance, at least the letter we have from the mayor here.

            you know, vehicles that have some sort of a motor, right? And there's categories or classes of e-bikes at some point moving up towards, you know, what we would call a moped or a motorbike. First, is that right? Do I have that correct? Turn any more? Yes, by statute, e-bikes would be allowed.

            Um, and that's, you know, much to the secret of the MBTA because of the state statute, ebikes currently as it's drafted would be allowed. Um, and are allowed. But my understanding is Mo Peds are not. Okay. Um, thank you for that. And.

            To the extent that you know, and if not, then no worries, I'll make a request if you could, to what extent do we have the ability to augment signage at path entrances? So if you correctly noted, there are signs that say no motorized vehicles.

            That's there's as we've just experienced now there's some ambiguity to what a motorized what that means, right? What is a motorized vehicle? Is there perhaps an opportunity for Clare for additional clarity or information there? And if so, or do you know if we have the ability to put signs up?

            I think if you were to put forward some options of what you would like to do, then the first thing I would want to do is to have my department look at the lease and what is or is not allowed under the lease and whether we already have protections in place or not, and then probably want to work with the MBTA to see what there is that we could do or not.

            But without knowing specifically what you want signs to say or what exactly our rights are to put up independently signs without working with the MBTA, I am not prepared to answer that right now.

            Yeah, okay, very well. No worries. Yeah, if you could, if you or someone new team could take a look at that, I mean, obviously it's a, you know, I'm thinking just something with some more clarity as to, you know, mopeds, motorbikes, e-bikes, what class, something a little bit more than just some people have a determined whether they are or are not on a motorized vehicle as they wing whizz past the sign. On that point. Yeah, Councillor Chazza, go ahead. Thank you.

            Fair point city attorney on the legality of a sign. But I asked an open-ended question that if we took a sandwich board and put pictures that said no, no normal pets or yes, and sandwich board that can be picked up,

            If we heard the feelings of the MBTA from us just putting a simple sandwich board up at an intersection, whoops, our bad, we can take it down. Without having to ask for permission, I would much rather just ask for an apology on that if it's saving someone from being hurt or not. So thank you.

            Okay. Thank you, Councillor Schrasso. Councillor Scott. Thank you, Mr. Chair. And thank you to Celestir Amara. Amara. Man, I'm going to have to look that one up. My apologies. So, to attorney Amara, I would love to see if you have a citation on which

            modes of conveyance are considered to be motorized vehicles for the purposes of that law. I'm sure, of course, electric wheelchairs would be excluded as well, but I just, you know, how much I love a good citation. So if you could pass that along, I'd appreciate it. And you know what, I'd also be happy to take a look at that lease for the community path to see if anything pickles my fancy in terms of ideas we can implement. That said, Mr. Chair,

            I think we're having the discussion that's being requested. It sounds like the answer to me is that the Boston ordinance doesn't have any particular relevance here, but that there are some good ideas for signage, which in my opinion would be outside of the scope of this order and would be best handled with a council order at our next meeting. Thank you, Mr. Chair.

            Okay, thank you, Council Scott. So I think look to Mr. Salisbury's points initially, if there's some feedback in terms of the experience here at Boston and something we may be able to do that we think makes sense as far as creating an insurance system, then that we could certainly consider taking that

            to that aspect of the request up.
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="3498.539" data-end="3527.243">

            But if that is all that's in the Boston ordinance, then it probably doesn't quite get us to the suggested intent here of the community path. So I'm inclined to leave this one in committee. And then, you know, Terry, Omar, thank you for listening to our questions and requests. If there's some feedback or Scott, you want to

            work with a lot of department over the recess to take peek at those documents and see what we might be able to do in terms of some signs. Then I do agree that if so, a separate order would be appropriate to work. I mean, frankly, we'd necessarily even need an order to just do it. But if we want to have the discussion about what makes sense, that is something that I would think could probably be taken up in a traffic parking or another committee.

            since it's really outside of the legislative piece of the equation. So any further discussion on this item? Okay. As I said, I'm inclined to leave it committee just in case there's something that folks want to pursue once we come out of recess. If not, it can certainly be marked work complete. But as I said, we're going to start the conversation on it. I'm inclined to stick to my word.

            and leave it in committee for a future discussion with whatever direction that might go. And so that brings us to the items five and six on the agenda. I would thank you, Attorney Amara, I appreciate your input on that one. The last two items here, I put on the agenda so that they can be placed on file or marked complete.

            And so two five dash zero zero seven is Chris one submitting comments regarding the urban forestry committee recommendations. Those recommendations have been codified and passed. We just must have must have missed putting that one on the agenda as cleanup item. So I will suggest that we place that on file and then item 25 dash zero one five four is an order.

            that the director of economic development presented this council plan to ensure compliance with section 18- sorry 8-18 of the code of ordinances. This is sort of a companion item to an item that was discussed in the licensing commission last week. Basically the exact same topic.

            Council Burnley, who put this item in, of course, chairs the committee on licenses and permits. And we had a lengthy discussion with the administration on the status of that ordinance. And so I would encourage folks to take a look at that if there's, if you're interested in it. But I think there's certainly, I serve on license and less than the permits. So my view is that that discussion effectively covered

            the entirety of the substance of this, and so I'm inclined to market work complete unless there's any objections. Any discussion on those two, the disposition of those two items? All right, seeing none, that brings us to the end of our agenda. Is that correct? Madam Clerk? Yep, that is correct.
