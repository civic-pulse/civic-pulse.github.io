            All right, good evening, everyone. I'm Jake Wilson. He, him, pronouns, counsel at large and your finance committee chair. It's 6 o'clock p.m. on the dot. And I'd like to call to order the Tuesday, July 8th, 2025, meeting of the finance committee, the Central City Council.

            First, it's my pleasure to read this text to y'all, pursuant to chapter two of the acts of 2025. This meeting of a city council committee will be conducted via remote participation. We will post an audio video recording and a comprehensive record of these proceedings as soon as possible after the meeting on the city of Somerville website and local cable access government channels. Now, Clerk, could you please call the roll to establish quorum? This is roll call, Councillor Emba. Present.

            Excellent. Folks, we've been taken up our 14 item agenda tonight in the order posted. If you're saying that's a long agenda, it will not be the first seven items are likely to go fairly quickly here. So with that, let's dive in. We're going to take up those six minutes items, agenda items one through six. Together, those are the minutes from this committee's meetings during last month's budget season. Wave the readings of those on those minutes. Any discussion?

            All right, those items are laid on the table to recommend approval to single vote at the end of tonight's meeting. And that's going to bring us to agenda item seven, ID number 25-0848, the mayor request and approval to accept and expend a $38,500 grant with no new match required from the Boston office of emergency management to the police department for the special response team equipment. The administration has indicated they have an update for us on this item, so I'll recognize legislative liaison Kimberly Hunter.

            Thank you, Chair Wilson. Yes, we would like to withdraw this item. When we were blessed for the finance committee, you may recall there's another grant we put in for a larger amount for similar purposes. So we are going to sort of consolidate those and we'll be back before this committee after the recess to address that item. But this one could be withdrawn. Thank you.

            All right. Clerk, we're going to mark this item as withdrawn then. Councillor Scott, did you have a question about this before we do that? Yes, Mr. Chair, something I think might be helpful when that comes back. Go ahead, Councillor. All right, thank you, sir. As I'm looking at the item itself, there's

            In the letter, the equipment award letter there, it references UIC, fiscal year 23 UIC plan project justification, U23, 1.2 regional SWAT sustainability. I've been looking for that document online and I'll admit I have not been able to find it anywhere. So if the administration would be able to provide that document to us in advance of that conversation, I think that'd be very helpful. All right.

            Thank you. Thanks for signaling that ahead of time. That's good. All right. Any more discussion on this? We are going to place or mark this one as withdrawn. All right. Item is going to be marked as withdrawn. It's going to take us to our 8th agenda item. That is ID number 25-1086. The mayor requesting authorization to dispose of bicycles previously abandoned in the city of central to a charitable organization.

            Who wants to speak on this one first? Chief Benford, you want to, you want me first up here? Good evening. Thank you very much. I really appreciate the opportunity. And I do apologize. It is clear I don't have enough bandwidth at home to do both audio and visual. So I am off camera in my sincere apologies, although I have tried. Through the chair, I'd like to thank the members here this evening, as well as the IGA and the May staff.

            and city staff with regards to this proposal. This is a dynamite program that provides an opportunity for us to dispose of bikes that have been held by SPD, largely as found properly for a number of years to an equitable program that really helps us when we talk about our commitment to

            through the disposition process and possibly destruction over time through the support of the court. This allows us to work with our partners in mobility and law and city partners to distribute these bikes across the city in an equitable way. We looked at a number of different local partners to include some of the bike kitchen, bikes not bombs, who's not

            situated in Somerville but does have some services that they were writing Somerville. We looked at groundwork Somerville and we looked at bike to see and regrettably because of the large volume of bicycles that we have none of them had the capacity to take the bikes on and work with us and distribute the bicycles to

            our community members do an equitable fashion. They just didn't have the capacity, although they had the spirit and the heart to want to do it. Through a spirited recommendation from one of our captains at the police department, they recommended the YMCA as a partner in this space. And the YMCA stepped up has the capacity and has agreed to work with us to distribute these bikes. At this juncture, we have approximately 78 bikes.

            that we're looking to distribute through this iteration. They have offered up a program that looks at, you know, some program goals that talk about program to promote sustainable transportation and enhance community health and wellbeing.

            Advanced equity and access foster positive community relations and promote bicycle safety and education. I would like to mention that when we talk about the bicycles, they've been in opposition for some time. Many of them are in very good shape, but others require

            some tuning up and some refreshing to ensure that they're road worthy and safe for our community to use. So I enthusiastically again promote this program and presented to this committee and ask for approval and support to move this forward. We think that this is a win-win for our community for our ideals around alternative transportation.

            as well as being able to provide a vital resources, right, pride of vital resource for some community members who may otherwise be economically disadvantaged and may not be able to enjoy this, this, this asset, this opportunity. Thanks, Chief. Well, wait for colleagues to jump in the questions. I'll ask one here. First of all, good to see this happen. And I know this is something Council, you and Camp and the Council are clinging. I believe putting an item back in 2021 about this. So,

            Hey, next best time, the present. Question was, I know, I think Cambridge bite give back, if I recall, did an event in the city maybe a couple of years ago where they looked at it all as an option here. Did anyone talk to them also? That's to you, chief.

            being considered, we really did put a focus on local entity opportunities and organizations initially. We would have certainly taken a look at them as we did look broad and wide, but we just didn't know about it. But we did not, to my knowledge, take a look in IGA as well as mobility did help in that space. I'm not sure if anyone from IGA may be able to offer up any thoughts on it, but initially in our memo,

            It did cite the organizations that we did look at in that one as an initial example.

            All right, you know, I get it, and I understand the urge to wanna go at the Y. I just know Cambridge Bike Giveback does a lot of this. I think they've done over 5,000 bikes at this point. And I understand this is gonna be a recurring thing. So, you know, I would just urge, you know, if the Y comes back and says this was a lot for us, take a look at Cambridge Bike Giveback as well, maybe for the next one. I see IGA has, maybe you're gonna answer that question too. I'll call on our legislative liaison.

            Thank you, Mr. Chair. I was just going to make the comment that you have just made, which is that this will be a recurring process. Any additional donation of bikes that the city will do will will come back before the Council. So this is a at this point in time we have these bikes there being

            This is a agreement that we have as if and as we accumulate additional bikes, a new agreement would have to be made. So if there are other organizations that this council is aware of that we should connect with, please let us know. I jotted that one down for future. So if there are other ones, please let us know. We'll look to partner with those folks in the future.

            Yeah, and to be clear, no shade on the Y here. We love the Y. Just strike me, it might be a little bit outside their traditional wheelhouse. Hopefully maybe some of the bike kitchen could partner with them and help out and lend some expertise on this in terms of getting those bikes fixed up. Just thinking out loud here. But yeah, very glad to see this happen and this is something that's been years in the making.

            happy to see it happen. Councillor Burnley, you were first. Actually, did you have a response to that liaison hunter or is the hand still up from before? From before, thank you. Oh, sure. Yeah, yeah. Councillor Burnley, you're up first and then Councillor Mabah.

            Thank you. I guess I'll start on that point. Yes, Cambridge Bike Give Back is a great organization. It's not technically local, but they did two years ago on April 18th come to the Mystics with yours truly. I had conversations with some folks in leadership there and we gave away 75 bikes, I believe it was.

            which is about this total, actually, ironically. And I'm only able to cite that number because there's a post from a little over two years ago about this. Now, given that the Y is, you know, its own sort of organization in there, have lead memberships for the Y, my natural question would be,
        </div>

        <p>

            Would the folks eligible to receive these bikes have to be members of the Y would it be available to the wider community? That's for the chief or IGA anyone who can answer.

            So thank you, Councillor, through the chair, one I want to acknowledge and thank you both for the suggestion of Cambridge Bike Gateway. We didn't have all the answers in this space. And as IGA mentioned, this is one iteration, and I do see an opportunity to work with others in the future.

            directly at your question, directly at your question, Councillor, is that they do not have to be a member of the Y. We wanted to make sure, as best we could, that this opportunity is being made available to the community without having to have an affiliation with any one organization, right? It's about the end kind gesture, so they do not have to be members of the Y in order to benefit from this program.

            Only certain people are to have access to these services or resources, particularly given that these bikes have been languishing for a number of years, despite repeated orders and conversations from this council and previous councils. I'm glad to hear that this could be more widely available. Hopefully this is something that

            The all this entire list of organizations could help trump it so that the wider community could be aware of any day in particular in which these giveaways are happening. And so we can all get it to the folks who needed the most. Thank you. Thank you.

            Thank you chair. Thank you for being here. I guess I just have like maybe like some clarification questions generally like I'm curious to know if we have like any well maybe this is not even to you. I guess to you to the chair

            And to them, maybe to the administration, like, do we have a city policy or ordinance governing the disposal of abandoned, you know, like property, which include banks? I will just jump in. Well, I see Jay there. So I'm going to defer the law. I was going to just offer that up and defer to them, but laws on the Brown School calls my comments. Thank you, sir. Okay.

            Thank you, and can members see me? Yeah, we can see you. Thank you, through the chair. There is an internal policy regarding the disposition of surplus property, like these bicycles would be considered surplus municipal property. And it runs through actually enacting this process and required

        </p>

        <p>

            redoing that internal policy to include disposition by donation to a charity for less than fair market value. That is a provision that's explicitly allowed by state statute 30B section 15. It's the last paragraph within there. But I don't know, does that answer the question, Councillor?

            Yeah, I guess, you know, yeah, because generally, you know, I'm always like trying to look at like a big picture because now we have like just one set of, you know, we talk about bikes and then I just, it's just all caught in me that, you know, we must have like something brought, broadly speaking. And then, yeah, no, I think you, you give me some ideas of what I was looking for.

            for that. I guess to the chief, you know, how long must it say a bicycle remain on claim before it is deemed abandoned? Here, may I just interrupt for a moment, the clerk here. Peace, can you just introduce yourself, name and title for the record? Thank you.

            And I'm sorry, I don't know if those directed to me. Yes, please. Oh, I'm sorry, Jake peaks assistant city solicitor and chief, I don't want to step on your toes here, but I might be able to answer that question for you as well. And I just wanted to potentially add another clarifying point.
        </div>

        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="965.753" data-end="995.42">

            I want to be clear that when we're talking about amending existing internal policies, it's actually, while bicycles fit within this parameter, it actually applies to all surplus municipal property. So, these bicycles, because they had been on the claim for a period of time, because there had actually been some notice on them. I guess the general answer to your question, Councillor,
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="996.938" data-end="1021.795">

            And maybe just a some background about to be helpful. I'm a little bit fuzzy on the exact date. It's at least, you know, three to six months or so ago, probably more like six months or so ago. The city posted a notice with all of these, with all the vacant bicycles, including a description and serial number.
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="1021.795" data-end="1045.437">

            I believe most of these were tagged with an incident number as to how they came into the custody of the police department. But the city posted a notice and advised that anybody in the world who might have abandoned a bicycle or thought that they've left a bicycle in Somerville to make any claims on these bicycles by a certain date or that
        </div>
        </p>

            In the alternative, should they not do that, the city would deem them to be abandoned property and we would we would take methods to dispose of them, including claiming them as our surplus property and then disposing them to a charity.

            There was a notice kind of outlining what the steps that the city intended to take was. And, you know, it was, I know my recollection is posted on the city website and I believe through local, local newspapers as well, but I will. That's my recollection. I'll jump in and say it was February 26th. Oh, next. Thank you.

            Thank you, Chair. Thank you, Assistant Solicitor Pigs. I appreciate that. Yeah, I think, you know, I guess just one last question I have is just just in terms of like maybe

            you know, like the criteria used to select, you know, what charitable organization. It should be said, you know, like because we have a lot of non-profit consultant in the city and other organization that work criteria was used, you know, for the selection.

            Thank you, Councillor Robb. I'll jump in on that through the chair. Thank you for the question. So the biggest concern that we had was obviously that these bikes have been in opposition for some time and we wanted to ensure that they were safe. So the biggest piece of the criteria was really around obviously because they were bikes we focused on those types of organizations, whether they, you know, initially we looked at businesses but obviously we were trying to partner with the nonprofit.
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="1168.203" data-end="1197.835">

            for a smoother and easier pathway. But we looked at the capacity. So we're talking 78 bikes, which is just an enormous amount of volume. And then talking with most of the vendors and partners, they just didn't have the capacity to be able to intake the bikes. And then the second piece, which was a big piece of the criteria was they had to agree to repair the bikes. The city was not in a position to pledge resources and funds to purchase material.
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="1197.835" data-end="1212.668">

            or goods or services to be able to do that. So part of the partnership, we were looking for a pledge to not only take the bikes on repair the bikes, but also assist with distribution. So that was really the large, large high level criteria.
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>

            Again, we looked at the ones that were obvious to us, we did a little bit of homework, regrettably within bump into Cambridge by get back on, but we'll learn from that and certainly incorporate them into the future. But those are really the big broad areas, was one, the capacity to take them on, be the ability and willingness to partner with us to repair them, and then thirdly, an equitable distribution process.

            All right, committee members, anything else on this item? All right, with that, we are going to lay this on the table to recommend approval at the end of the meeting.

            I can't take every single item up together just as an FI. We do one roll call. We lay them on the table.

            Yeah, and then everyone knows what they're voting on, definitely. Thank you. All right, that's going to bring us to our 9th agenda item ID number 25-1068. The mayor requests an approval to enter into a contract of up to 10 years for the services of an operator of the greater Boston bike share program, blue bikes. I believe we have, I see director Naseo. Director, you want to take it away?

            Yes, thank you through the chair. This is a semi standard item. So as all the counselors and committee might be aware, Somerville is a participating municipality in the blue bikes bike shares regional system.

            And the network is now up to 13 municipalities. It will be a 10-year contract, which is why we are here before you tonight to seek approval to enter into a 10-year contract.

            You know, we've heard in the past there were requests for station stations be placed in areas of the city that currently are served very well. What sort of.

            is this the same sort of relationship that we've had in the past in terms of trying to get stations installed places that maybe blue bikes isn't so excited to install them, but that we know are underserved. You know, I'm just, just to name one, you know, there's no blue bike station in the mystics. You know, and that's a huge population. I know blue bikes get used a lot there. The closest one is, closest station to them is considerably far. So I'd be curious like, you know,

            How that works on this might be one for director Ross and I realize of mobility, but you know, just naming that I'd love to see. Love to see us be able to get some stations into places that say they're currently underserved in the Blue Bikes network.

            Sure, thank you, Chair Wilson. So I do know that I was involved in the last process or two of these contracts ago. And so I know as part of the contract negotiations is, you know, there is discussion of how the network will expand and grow and also.

            you know, what will be added and what sort of maintenance and capital improvements will take place. Specifically for this contracting cycle, I'm not sure. I'm happy to take this feedback back to the mobility team and director Rossin and have him reach out. And I know that the MA, I'm not sure that the MA PC has officially kicked off the procurement process, but I know that, you know, before we can enter anything we

            Sure, can I just really quickly say I'd love to see one station added at the Mystics or Healey School or Blessing the Bay Boat House somewhere in that area. Lincoln Park and Arjun Ziano, Capawano and Glen Park, 165 Broadway, where team of powerments based out of, and the Dillboy State even pool. Those are locations that I think would really help the community.

            Thank you, Chair. I just wanted to say that I know that directly in Russia is going to deliver on this. So, you know, so Du Boin just right there. And in fact, when you're mentioning all those different places, and then it just kind of like I opened the map to see it.

            Thanks, Councillor. You won't be surprised. I spent a whole time with that map this afternoon. So it was not just randomly throwing, throwing, you know, no, and thank you that I can answer. I appreciate your word. Fun fact, Ward two enjoys the most blue bike stations in the city. So congrats to Councillor Scott for for bringing that. Sadly, Ward's four, six and seven have the fewest with three of these. So Councillor Verneley. Withdrawal.

            That is going to bring us to our 10th agenda item ID number 25-0978. The mayor requesting approval to execute the fourth amendment to the lease agreement with Dana Family Series LLC for the Grove Street parking lot through June 30th, 2026. I see we have director Suzanne Rindford from parking with us. Director Rindford, please tell us. Good evening. Good evening. Thank you for having me. Suzanne Rindford, director of parking.

            parking lot behind, oh my God, the kittens market, sorry, the kittens market in Davis Square. So there's, there's 17 spaces back there and this is just gonna extend that. All right, colleagues, any discussion on this? I think there's nothing to talk about, Chair. I have a question, but I'm happy to let colleagues jump in here first.

            All right, I'll just say this is the site of the much talked about 25 story tower in Davis Square that developers been holding meetings about with the community. You know, obviously there's no application for anything related to that proposed tower currently before the city, but our indications that the property owner is happy to keep renewing this lease until such a time that things might change and there's an actual application for something to do with that site.

            Through the chair, yes, they have an agreement. We have an agreement with them that if something does come to fruition, then they can cancel this lease. Does this Fourth Amendment here before us still contain a termination for convenience? Correct. Okay. It is that now 90 days that was in line with the change made back in 2023. That is correct, sir. Okay.

            I'm not sure I want to know the answer this, but does this mean that this week we've been operating a municipal parking lot there without a lease? Correct. I guess that's better than 2023 when we didn't do this until mid-August. All right, next best time now to get a lease done. So, colleagues, anything on this?

            Thank you chair. So just introduce myself. My name is Ben de Merse. I'm a senior planner real estate specialist with the economic development division of OSPCD. I use he him. So through Mr. Chair to the committee, this item is to request approval of the final urban center housing tax increment financing or uptiff agreement for the 299 Broadway project. Just to give a little bit of context, the uptiff program, which is managed by the state's executive office of housing and livable communities or HLC.
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="2009.388" data-end="2032.355">
            <span class="timestamp"><a href="https://somervillema.granicus.com/player/clip/2714?autoplay=1&entrytime=2009" class="timestamp-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[33:29]</a></span>
            Authorizes municipalities to provide a real estate tax exemption on all or a portion of the increased value of improved real estate i.e. the increment on the value over a period of up to 20 years. And the goal of this program is really to support new housing and commercial development, especially affordable housing. So back in 2023, the city council had conditionally agreed to provide a full 100% exemption on the increment.
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="2032.355" data-end="2050.782">
            <span class="timestamp"><a href="https://somervillema.granicus.com/player/clip/2714?autoplay=1&entrytime=2032" class="timestamp-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[33:52]</a></span>
            for a full 20-year period for the 299 Broadway project. As a reminder, this redevelopment of a long vacant start market, adjacent building and parking lot in Winter Hill will create 319 new units of housing, 136 of which are deeter-started affordable, along with new retail space, two new public-saving spaces, and a community room.
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="2050.782" data-end="2067.843">

            And the intention stated at that time was to return to the city council for final approval once the project was closer to receiving its building permits, which the team is working to do over the next month for an anticipated financial closing this September. The goal was to make sure that the full octave amount was still needed when the project was further along in its planning process.
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="2067.843" data-end="2085.528">
            <span class="timestamp"><a href="https://somervillema.granicus.com/player/clip/2714?autoplay=1&entrytime=2067" class="timestamp-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[34:27]</a></span>
            So economic development has worked with an independent real estate consultant, Abram Center Associates, who also subcontracts with a consultant focused specifically on the affordable housing portion of the deal to review updated project financials and have determined that the full amount of the exemption is still needed to achieve a reasonable return on the investment.
        </div>
        </p>

        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="2085.528" data-end="2110.975">

            We're therefore looking to lock in this exemption percentage in period in an updated uptiff agreement. This agreement would also capture some changes that have been made to the project since 2023, including an increase in the unit count, all of which have been approved by the Somerville Zoning Board of Appeals, the ZBA. If recommended positively and approved by the full council, the updated agreement would then be signed by the mayor and would be sent to HLC and recorded with the Middlesex South registry of deeds.

            So thank you all for listening to the background context. I'm here as well as Attorney Selkert. As you mentioned, to answer any questions that you might have. Also note that we have several representatives from the tuna and broadway development partnership here with us this evening as attendees.

            All right, any questions on this? I'll just say quickly. Basically, the pro forma of the financials that the developer provides show the construction costs haven't gone down and or projected future rental revenues haven't gone up. Such that they're going to need the full UCH tip to make the project pencil out. And we are just updating the agreement to reflect the final project numbers, right?

            That was a scenario. I remember I asked about that back in 2023. So I just appreciate the thorough examination, the due diligence here to determine that they are going to need the full benefit of that tax increment financing. So thank you to you and everyone there for working on this. Good to see this project moving, moving ahead and hopefully getting to a ground breaking in September. Council Burnley.

            Thank you, through the chair. Yeah, I was waiting for that date to break ground to come up. I heard September want to make sure we're still on track for that because, you know, it's a major project with as far as my perspective from the city side.

            the most generous, you know, supports that the city can offer with this kind of an uptiff. What I want to do something to that effect is it's going to be a long drawn out process. Just to get a sense of this uptiff a little bit more within section six of the amendment and restated agreement on point six of section six. Is this

            Is this amount of 4.3 million the amount that we are for going through the uptiff or is this the whole worth currently and the amount that would be generated through the improvement of the parcel was a different number? That could be for anyone who can answer. Probably.

            the project team. Mr. Chair, can you see my hand? It's Attorney Kathy Lester Selker, OSPCD. My understanding through the Chair to Council Burnley is, I don't know exactly what paragraph you're looking at, but it sounds like you're referring to the base, like what the unimproved value of that parcel is, and that is the threshold.

            for the UCHTIF so that those taxes will continue to be paid. It's the increment as the project is developed that will not be included. That's what gets deferred for 20 years. So they know the taxes that they'll be required to pay are fixed. That answers your question. There's probably someone on the team who could speak to it more if you have further question about that. No, that answers my question. My question was, is this the number, is the number a different number?

            Most likely, but now we know we're not going to know the assess value of this necessarily 15 years from now. That's based on market conditions and what improvements get made, you know, what the tendency looks like at that. I just want to get as close of a read on that as I could because, you know, we're talking a couple, you know, pay full millions of dollars here and then 20 years of taxes. So want to be mindful of

            I know that at this point, we are mostly interested in terms of the mechanism now going forward, but we have all these different pockets of ways and approach that we are using for different projects. Can somebody really differentiate what is going on?

            Yeah, so it's for you, Mr. Chair. There is a definite distinction between TIFF and DIFF in the rest of the country. TIFF and DIFF are more or less similar, but in Massachusetts, DIFF is district increment financing and TIFF is tax increment financing.

            The ACTIF, which is the preferred method of pronunciation that the state uses, is the urban center housing tax and current financing program. It is a very specific program run out of, I think, which now is HLC, the housing and livable communities. And ACTIF is a specific program for adding

            For supporting projects that add housing to commercial areas, this is the only site in some of that what we currently have an active plan approved the active plan covers the properties that we have for the urban renewal plan in winter health. We've.

            It's now been several months since Tom and Mike Filoni and I were with you all to talk about the broad range of tools that we could be using to support further housing production in Somerville. We are planning to do that again, but this one is very specifically only right now applied in winter health. District increment financing, we have used in a few different cases.

            Thank you, Rachel. Yeah, just for there's only one additional tool and obviously some of those are very challenging housing market. Probably one of the most challenging housing markets in the country. So we try to utilize any and all financing that we can. But we did use the standard disk district improvement financing in Clarendon for the infrastructure work. And we're also hopefully will

            One programming note, there is a replacement item for one, let's see, for 1164 that's going 25-1164 that's on the agenda for Thursday night. We're going to go ahead and discuss this.

            I see we have St. Crue there. Whoever wants to talk about these two agreements, you are officially recognized. I think I'm up, Mr. Chair, unless someone tells me otherwise. Kathy, let's just solve it again. The best way to distinguish between these two agreements, they're going by their name. So Broadway, Property, Owner, LLC, that is the Broadway Pocket Park.

            And there is a single, there's a few unique things about these two easements. One is that we're doing these far in advance to add predictability for the finances that will be participating in the financial closing in September. They wanted to have all of the documents that will pertain to this development to be executed and on record as of the financial closing.

            The Broadway Pocket Park will be at one end, and the Sewell Park Civic Space will be at the other end, and they're connected by something called the pedestrian muse. And there's a single landscape maintenance and management plan that covers Sewell Park, the pedestrian muse and Broadway Pocket Park that will be incorporated in the easement for

            the Broadway pocket park and then civil park in order to facilitate using a mass works grant. That money is being made to purchase that property ahead of time and it's going to be held by the SRA.

            And once it's developed, it will be conveyed by the SRA to the city. And that is the explanation for the substitute item because the way this was put in on the agenda, it says we're creating an access easement and also mentioned a covenant. I'll get to that in a moment. The easement will already be on record.

            There's a separate easement executed with the SRA that grants access to different areas includes it's referenced in the Sewell Park maintenance agreement. It'll still stay there. It shows you that the easement will already be on record as of that time.

            Same thing for the covenant. The covenant is the agreement that will run with the land that requires that the civic space or that it be maintained as a public park civic space type in perpetuity. So we're kind of doing things in a little bit of a different order than we typically do. And I hope that at least gives you a flavor of what's going on with these two documents.

            I'm going to call on Councilor Scott and once again, as I like to do, I just love to make sure I have a summary of these, when we get these long agreements here. Basically, the property owner is, is granting 24 seven public access to the Muse and the Temple Street passageway and EDM to sunset access to the Broadway Park of Plaza. I have a feeling Councilor Scott might, might be about to ask about that. The property owner is responsible for maintenance and repairs of civic space and pedestrian access areas.

            And he changes to the civic space would need to be approved by the city. And Sule Park is being transferred in perpetuity to the city, but Tune in Broadway property on our LLC is going to be responsible for maintenance and repairs of the park, including snow and trash removal and the landscape. And is that a fair? Yes, very good summary. Thank you. Councillor Scott. Oh, thank you, Mr. Chair. You know how much I love it closely with easement agreements.

            The question I had was actually in some of the depth and some of the depth of these documents, for members of the public, these are incredible documents. If you're curious as to how much work goes into crafting these agreements and really how much thought goes into the design of our public spaces, these are 47 page documents and there's a lot of specificity in terms of

            Maybe we've already handled it through a different mechanism, is when referring to furnishings, it talks about some movable furnishings being brought inside seasonally and the inspection requirements for fixed furniture, but I didn't see any requirements in the fixed furnishings. They not be what's termed hostile architecture, right?

            sometimes called anti-homeless architecture. And I was curious if I know there's been several attempts by the City Council to prevent the city from installing or using any such. Is that covered already in this agreement or is this? I'm hoping my concern is unfounded, I guess, attorney. So, Selger.

            Thank you for the question. Through the chair, I have to say that that is something that is handled by piece of and by the particular planner who was working on this project. I don't know if he is here this evening, but I would be happy to bring that question to him and get an answer back to you on that. You basically want to know more about the type of furnishings that will be used.

            And actually the someone from the project team may be able to answer that question because they've got quite a quite a number of folks here this evening so I can certainly open it up to them with the chair's permission if there's anyone who wants to speak to that.

            I'd certainly be open to that, Mr. Chair, and value any input that anybody on the team has. I know that in Pops, down in Ward 2, I've worked pretty diligently to make sure that the design involves, let's say, majority movable furniture, for example, just because that gives greater access and flexibility for people in the parks, and been very clear about the incorporation of any hostile architecture and elements.

            I guess knowing the intentions upfront is one thing, but since these are legally binding documents for the construction design of these things, I'd be curious if there is an existing prohibition, I guess, that would make restating it ear subherfeless.

            Yeah, one quick comment before we turn it over. Through the chair to counselors got. It's piece of has to sign off on all of these things too. And so to the extent that it's not covered specifically in here right now, they still have the the sign off authority, but I will will turn it over to a member of the project team if there's someone here who can answer that question.

            While attorney's silker is looking for that, I guess I'll return then. Counselor Scott, are you willing to let me bring up the sunset closing time? And just ask, are we all cool with that given that sunsets as early as 415, 414, I think some years here in the Boston area? We cool with the civic space being closed to the public before close of business.

            I'll ask it, you know, I guess to come with a question to ask this, is there lighting that can be used there? Is there no lighting? Is that why we want it to be closed at sunset? To whoever wants to take that.

            Attorney Sockin, and if you have an answer to the original question, happy to table my question here and come back. Well, I'm still still looking for the original question, Mr. Chair, but to answer the current question that you have, the, I believe there's an ordinance that specifies those are the park general park hours. And I think it was taken from there. And using it outside those hours is by permit. So, you know, you can get a permit for an event, you can get a permit for different things, but it's generally
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>

            It's stated in the ordinance, those are the typical park hours, I believe. I'm just gonna say that's not my recollection of how park hours and some of that. I can believe, because I'm not sure if I'm gonna talk about that. Yeah, yeah. And I know this is coming for Councillor Scott's eagle eye caught, somewhat similar thing involving some pops over an assembly. And we ended up having that easement amended

            to have a more reasonable end time to it. Especially in that case, it was definitely in the interest of the private party because they were going to have people leaving work after sunset. Just naming that as something that caught my eye and caused me some concern. It doesn't seem like that would be something anyone really wants is to have people not be able to use a park at 4.30.

            Councillor Brilly, do you have something on this? Yeah, I don't know, actually, on two points, but I'll just thinking it in reverse. Just, you know, two-year points. Looking through our code of ordinances, there are in Article 3, Parks, playgrounds, and schoolgrounds, section 12-48, closing time with parks and playgrounds.
        </div>
        </p>

            Sentence reads, Parks and playgrounds shall be closed in the public except city personnel conducting city business. They're in daily between the hours of 10 p.m. and 8 a.m. Now 10 p.m. doesn't quite strike me as sunset, but you know, summertime. So I don't know. Sometimes it does go quite late.

            Thank you, Councillor. 10 PM was that I didn't want to throw that out there, but that was the figure in my head. So I think that that is a standard closing time for parks and several that I can remember. And not to interrupt, but that's a section I was thinking of in your. Okay. Okay. I mean.

            I guess on this point, I don't want to blow this up over closing time. I understand there's an urgency here because we need to get this agreed to on Thursday night so that we're about to go on recess. Our next meeting is August 28th and I know they are very eagerly looking to start the work to close on things and start the work on this in September.

            Is it, I'll ask, is it possible to get something like this a relatively small change like that negotiated and changed by Thursday? I know we have members of Mark development here in the audience. I know it's a little, it's a little unorthodox here, but I wanna see this, I wanna see this get approved on Thursday night, but I also wanna see some of these concerns addressed about the hostile architecture and about the hours.

            Uh, yeah, uh, senior planner Demers. Mr. Shared to the committee clerk just for facilitating this conversation. Could we potentially, um, promote a couple of the members of the development team that are attendees? Yes. Who would you like me to promote?

            And Councilor Scott still has. Councilor Scott, did you want to say something while we're figuring all this out too? No, I think we're following a productive line, sir. Okay. All right. I hope you're a desire to get this hammered out expeditious, I guess I would say. All right.

            And Mr. Chair, before we're waiting, Councillor Scott, I found language on piece of approval in the landscape management plan. It does not say what I thought it said, which is why it's always good to double check. Hang on, let me get it in front of me. Where did I open it? Here it is. Page 14.

            Paragraph, nope, hang on, it's the other one. Sorry, page 13, paragraph H. And it says, for the avoidance of doubt, movable furniture and elements can replace or updated without the need to obtain the approval of piece off. And that's for movable elements.

            Is that in the Sule Park document or the Broadway Plaza? I believe I'm sorry. I believe it is in the Broadway document. I was looking at a separate document in the file, but I'll find it. If it's a different number, I'll find the page number for you. Oh, geez. Let me grab that. I'm back to it. I'm not seeing it on page. I'll find it. I'll find it.

            Particularly respond first to the comment from Councillor Scott in regard to the hustle architecture, I would direct your attention to its in condition 83 of the comprehensive permit wires, peace software, approved 100% landscape construction plans and details for all of these civic spaces, which includes, but not limited to plantings, play equipment, fencing, retaining walls, bicycle facilities, trash receptacles, outdoor furniture, and utility cabinet locations.

            So it was a condition of the approval from the ZBA that we obtained piece of approval for everything that we're putting in these parks and walkways. Oh, great. Thank you for that.

            city ordinances relating to opening hours of public spaces. I guess I'm curious about the difference here with the specified sunset as opposed to 10 p.m. Yeah, Attorney McDonald, are you able to speak at all to that? That was some hours that were requested by the project team. I would guess I would defer to the project team if the flexibility around those hours.

            Hi, everyone. Scott LaBarrie from Mark Development. I'll just weigh in on that one. So I thought that we were trying to follow the lead of city staff legal piece up and what would be required by the city's ordinances for hours of operation. I think we'd be happy to say in this that we would just follow the city's guidelines. I didn't know that we were intentionally doing anything different there.

            at depth for the Muse and 24 hour access through there to keep that pedestrian connection. I don't remember specifically talking about it for the Broadway Park Plaza, but I think the intent there was to do with the city ordinances would require.

            All right, so that sounds encouraging. I'll ask the question then. Do we think it's possible to make that change, given that it's a fairly, it's fairly small change. Before Thursday, actually probably by, we'd probably have to say by tomorrow, I think four PM might be the deadline for a new item to be submitted, such that we can get this approved our night because we want to get this approved.

            Yeah, through the chair, I was going to say to the chair, that would be the process. Yeah, we can put a new, just as we're doing for the other one that's being substituted. That makes sense. And I, I misunderstood. I thought it was coming from the project team that they had requested that it be sunset. So there's a couple of misunderstandings going on at least, but great to hear that they want to do what the ordinance says. And just to be clear, we do feel that this is very easy to turn around here, basically, in the next, you know,

            21 hours or less. Okay, I see the city, on the city side, I see a nod on the developer side. Is there something that we can, that we can get turned around? I'll turn, uh, turning McDonald. Yeah. If my client is fine with changing it, it can be turned around in 10 minutes.

            Okay. All right. Let's go. We'll we'll hope to see a new item then submitted. Apologies to everyone who's going to have to do a little more work on this, but I think this is something that will I think it's worth that extra work. And I think the community will be in favor of that. So we are going to all right. Well, there's still discussion happening. Councillor Brennan, you have your hand up. I'll throw it your way here. Thank you.

            Yeah, I just wanted to follow up really briefly on the first point, our first hostile architecture that Councillor Scott brought up. I believe Councillor Scott, amongst other folks, may have been referring to an effort I was pushing on my first year on the council to put forward and ordinance the ban hostile architecture. In Somerville, at the time, I received many assurances from the administration

            specifically piece of that they currently do not have any designs that would be considered hostile architecture. They have no interest or plans to adopt such designs, which if that is still the case, and I have no reason to believe it is not based on my purview of the community, I think that would satisfy this.

            I would, you know, as always, as a counselor and as a legislator, leading to my colleagues to consider whether they feel in the future, just having this kind of should be fully resolved. The ordinance would be their interest. I know that there's not the committee where that those actions would be taken. But I think the conversation that we've just had really does underlie the importance of

            having a word in its language that says, this is our operating standard around hours, around how we build public space.

            Anything else on this one, and while I'm waiting, I'm just going to reiterate that the deadline then is going to be 4 p.m. tomorrow, I believe, for a supplemental item to come in to make the agenda. So I just want to make sure everyone knows that, you know, and that's for it to reach the city clerk. So there's a whole process of that. So just want to have deadlines and people's heads here.

            Yes, Mr. Chair. Thank you. I just have one clarifying question. Are we also looking for language on the hostile architecture or we're saying now we're just recognizing that we don't have an ordinance at this time and piece of will have to approve whatever gets installed and we're satisfied with that. Okay. Good. I just wanted to make sure. So it's just this other park hours that we're going to change.

            Very good. It's about I see you nodding but your hands up so I'll call on you. Yeah, thank you very much. Yeah, no, I'm gonna trust to our folks at peace off making that with that with that language in there requiring their explicit approval and

            If for some reason it doesn't work out the way I would expect it would, then we can always go back to the ordinance that Council Burnley was discussing. So, no, I'm content with that approval piece of it and just very much want to get the operating hours or open hours of these resolved if it can. Thank you. Very good. Thank you. All right. Anything else on this then? It seems like we are arriving at a pretty good outcome here. Teamwork makes the dream work.

            All right. So I have a question then. So I want to make sure I get this right. Which agenda item is then going to be replaced? Please say it's the one that is already that we said we're going to mark for. So it would Mr. Sheriff, I have it straight. It'd be in Benken, check 25 1163, right? Because that's where the civil park went.
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="4103.744" data-end="4121.362">

            That's, oh, I beg your pardon, it's soil pocket is the one we're already doing, right? 1164. So the we can stick with the original plan of marking that is withdrawn. Then she'll let them take it. Yeah, senior planner to Merce. Um, Mr. Chair, so the.

        </p>

            And it's that we just made, and I'm not just confirming that I have to correct document, the edits that we just made to the hours are to the easement referenced in item 25-1163. So it's the other item, not the one that we're already planning to replace for a Thursday.

            All right, so that means we're going to have to, well, can we get a formal request from the administration to withdraw both AgendaIs 13 and 14? Because we technically are not the ones to withdraw items. It's the administration if they submit it.

            Mr. Chair, my recollection is that Kim Wells asked us to have you withdraw, because we had already agreed on the, on the soil park one. We can do it. Okay. I just need. Yeah. Yeah. Legislative liaison hunter. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I'm happy to make this request to have both items 13 and 14 on the agenda withdrawn. We will submit new items for Thursday. Thank you.

            Thank you, and thanks for your work doing the change here with a short turnaround on the park hours. All right, I've been heard that now. We're going to mark our agenda items 13 and 14 as withdrawn. And we know there is that already the replacement item for 25-1164 already on the agenda. And we heard tonight there's going to be a forthcoming supplemental item on tomorrow night's agenda to replace 25-1163.

            All right. Mr. Chair. Council move on. Do you feel good about this? I mean, I feel okay. It's like, I just, this is just to listen, listen harder. Like if you once this thing has been updated, can you send a clinch sheet to the finance team? I need time to look at, I was looking at two different documents. They are trying to even compare and contrast what

            you know, like what we are trying to, you know, paste together, they all look a little bit all over the place. So one clean document will be helpful, you know, for my review. Through the Chair to Councilor. And by absolutely the clean document will be attached to the items that are on the agenda, and you'll be able to see those when they're posted for the supplemental. And which is when?

            whenever the city clerk posts this up much of a agenda on Thursday. Typically Thursday, early afternoon-ish. To your chair, if that is fine, but if I start to look at this document on Thursday and there's a holdout, you know, we'll have to spend more time talking about it. So I need it tomorrow and not Thursday.

            So, Councillor, one of them's already up. The one with more changes is already up there as a sub, as a regular agenda item. So the one replacing 1164, there's a red line version and a clean version there, I believe. Yes, that's what I'm looking at. That was the changes. And then there will be the supplemental item that's going to have the requested change. The only change there will just be to the hours of operation for the parks.

            Thank you. Councillor Vaughn, now do we feel good about what we just did here? I think so. All right. Anything else on this then? I think I already said that we've marked them as withdrawn, so we're done talking about them apparently. So that brings us the end of tonight's agenda.
