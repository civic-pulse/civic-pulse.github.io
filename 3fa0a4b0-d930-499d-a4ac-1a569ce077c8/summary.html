<li>The Somerville Police Department (SPD) has held the bicycles, largely as found property, for a number of years.</li>

<li>Somerville is a participating municipality in the regional system managed by the Metropolitan Area Planning Council (MAPC).</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>12. ID 25-1160: Mayor's Request for Approval of the Final Urban Center Housing Tax Increment Financing (UCH TIFF) Agreement for the 299 Broadway Project</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Senior Planner Ben Demers presented the request for final approval of the UCH TIFF agreement for the 299 Broadway project.</li>
<li>The UCH TIFF program allows municipalities to provide a real estate tax exemption on the increased value of improved real estate for up to 20 years.</li>
<li>In 2023, the City Council conditionally agreed to provide a 100% exemption on the increment for 20 years.</li>
<li>The project will create 319 new housing units, 136 of which are deed-restricted affordable, along with new retail space, two new public civic spaces, and a community room.</li>
<li>The updated agreement reflects changes to the project since 2023, including an increase in the unit count.</li>
<li>Economic Development has worked with an independent real estate consultant, Abram Center Associates, to review updated project financials and determined that the full amount of the exemption is still needed.</li>
<li>Chair Wilson confirmed the developer's pro forma shows construction costs have not decreased and projected future rental revenues have not increased, necessitating the full UCH TIFF.</li>
<li>Councillor Burnley inquired about the $4.3 million amount referenced in Section 6 of the agreement.</li>
<li>Attorney Kathy Lester Selkert clarified that the $4.3 million represents the base, unimproved value of the parcel, and taxes will continue to be paid on that amount. The UCH TIFF applies to the increment as the project is developed.</li>
<li>Councillor Emba requested clarification on the different types of tax increment financing mechanisms used in the city, comparing the 299 Broadway project to projects at Clarendon and Assembly.</li>
<li>Director Net Carney explained the distinction between TIFF, DIFF, and UCH TIFF.</li>
<li>UCH TIFF is a specific program for supporting projects that add housing to commercial areas and is currently only applied in Winter Hill.</li>
<li>Director Anasio stated that District Improvement Financing (DIFF) was used in Clarendon for infrastructure work.</li>
<li><strong>Action:</strong> Item laid on the table to recommend approval.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>13. ID 25-1163: Mayor's Request for Approval of a Public Access and Maintenance Access Easement for 299 Broadway Property Owner LLC</strong></p>
<p><strong>14. ID 25-1164: Mayor's Request for Approval of a Maintenance, Access, Easement, and Landscape Management and Maintenance Plan for 299 Broadway Property Owner LLC for the Future Sewell Park at the 299 Broadway Development</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Attorney Kathy Lester Selkert explained the two easements: one for the Broadway Pocket Park and one for Sewell Park.</li>
<li>The easements are being executed in advance to provide predictability for the financial closing in September.</li>
<li>The Broadway Pocket Park and Sewell Park will be connected by a pedestrian muse.</li>
<li>A single landscape maintenance and management plan covers Sewell Park, the pedestrian muse, and Broadway Pocket Park.</li>
<li>Sewell Park is being purchased using MassWorks grant money and will be held by the SRA until it is conveyed to the city.</li>
<li>Chair Wilson summarized the key points of the agreements:<ul>
<li>The property owner is granting 24/7 public access to the Muse and the Temple Street passageway and easement to sunset access to the Broadway Park Plaza.</li>
<li>The property owner is responsible for maintenance and repairs of civic space and pedestrian access areas.</li>
<li>Changes to the civic space would need to be approved by the city.</li>
<li>Sewell Park is being transferred in perpetuity to the city, but 299 Broadway Property Owner LLC is responsible for maintenance and repairs, including snow and trash removal and landscaping.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Councillor Scott praised the detailed nature of the documents and inquired about the inclusion of "hostile architecture" in the fixed furnishings.</li>
<li>Attorney Selkert stated that the type of furnishings is handled by the Peace Department (Peace Off).</li>
<li>Chair Wilson asked about the sunset closing time for the Broadway Park Plaza, questioning if it was appropriate given that sunset can occur as early as 4:15 PM.</li>
<li>Attorney Selkert stated that the park hours were based on the city's general park hours ordinance.</li>
<li>Councillor Burnley cited Article 3, Section 12-48 of the city's code of ordinances, which states that parks and playgrounds are closed to the public between 10 PM and 8 AM.</li>
<li>Chair Wilson requested a change to align the park hours with the city ordinance.</li>
<li>Scott LaBarrie from Mark Development stated that the project team intended to follow the city's ordinances for hours of operation.</li>
<li>The committee agreed to make the change to align the park hours with the city ordinance.</li>
<li>Councillor Burnley referenced his past efforts to ban hostile architecture in Somerville and noted that there is currently no Peace Off policy against it.</li>
<li>Attorney Selkert clarified that the committee was satisfied with Peace Off approval of the furnishings and would only be changing the park hours.</li>
<li>Councillor Emba requested a clean version of the updated documents for review.</li>
<li><strong>Action:</strong> Both Agenda Items 13 and 14 were marked as withdrawn. The administration will submit new items for Thursday's agenda. A supplemental item will be added to replace 25-1163.</li>
</ul>
