            We'll begin this meeting with some moments of silence. Before I open it up to the full council, I do have a few I'd like to share myself.

            First, I'd like to share that our own Rich Rache lost his mother recently. Rich is a resident of Ward 7. So I'm going to read a piece of her obituary. Carol Patricia McNeil-Rache, 75 of Bradford passed away June 17th at Mass General Hospital. She was born in Boston on February 5th, 1950. She was a tireless caregiver with never-ending energy.

            and presents for her beloved children, grandchildren, and friends. Overflowing with generosity and spirit, she was kind to every stranger, an avid learner, and with a brilliant and perpetually curious mind. She completed a BA in English literature at Merrimat College and amasters in arts-based education in Endocott College.

            She never stopped exploring, reading multiple books a week up until the very end. She left to sing and sing beautifully, playfully clever, quick and funny. She brightened every single room. It's such a beautiful tribute to such a special woman. And I just wanted to say our thoughts are with Rich and his family right now.

            We also unfortunately are mourning the loss of another one of our city staff's parents. Tom Galaghani's father, Thomas Galaghani passed away on June 22nd, 2025, following a courageous fight with cancer. He was 82 years old, known as Tom to most.

            A proud resident of Bill Recca for more than 56 years, Tom was deeply involved in his community. He served on the Bill Recca school community for 24 years and is a town meeting member for 18 years, always advocating passionately for children, families, and education. Tom was an avid reader, gifted storyteller, and a true people person who brought joy and laughter to those around him. A lifelong Boston sports fan, he loved cheering on the Celtics and Red Sox and enjoyed traveling with his family.

            I think I'm out of present. I'd like to sign on to both. But I do want to acknowledge Tom Gallaghani senior, who I did know, who was a building master at some of the high when I graduated there. And I remember him fondly. He was a firm, but very caring person. And I'm sorry to hear that he passed. And I remember about the time that I got on this council, Tom Gallaghani Jr. got a job in the city. And there's a Mr. Gallaghani in the room.

            And I had to turn around, make sure I didn't get sent to the building master's office. But I got to know Tom very well, just like I kind of knew his father a little less. But I'm grateful to have had both of them in my life and to have them as public servants in the city as well as Mr. Raish and all the people who work for the city and commit their time to the city. So my thoughts are with both of them. Councillor Clingon.

            Madam President, thank you through you. I'd like to recognize and keep in our thoughts the ferns and family of Jason Laporte. Jason was a friend of mine. We grew up in the city of Somerville. He would have been 49 years old. He leaves behind his wife, Christine Laporte, his brother Frankie, his brother, Keithy.

            and his sister, Crystal, he survived, I'm sorry, his mom passed away a number of years ago. Jason had a heart of gold, he was the sweetest, one of the sweetest people I knew. He grew up rough, but he always stayed kind, and I'll always remember him for that, and I just hope that we'll keep his loved ones in our thoughts and prayers today. Thank you.

            You may be seated. I was remiss and did not share, since we are at capacity, our emergency instructions, so I will do that now.

All exit doors have an exit sign about the doorway, all means of egress, including aisles, hallways, stairways, firescapes and exit doors within this city council chamber.

            Stay with me. I will guide you through this meeting this evening. And with that, Madam Clerk, let's take up the next item. Thank you, Madam President. The first citation will be item 2.2, a citation by Councillor Wilson, commending Jason Deorio and Kevin McCormick for their actions on June 11, 2025, providing assistance to a community member in need.

            Madam President, on June 12th, a community member fell and hit her head while crossing the street in Spring Hill. Fortunately, a crew from our DPW Highway Division was there doing a sidewalk replacement and they witnessed the incident. Jason Diario and Kevin McCormick called 911 to report the injury.
        </div>

            and then provided support and care while awaiting the arrival of the EMTs. A neighborhood called into 3-on-1 to report how wonderful, in their words, Mr. Giorgio and Mr. McCormick were in a really stressful situation. So it just shows how city staff are caring members of our community and we should be recognizing going above and beyond like this when it does happen. So I believe we have our DPW Commissioner Jill Lathen here.

            that you guys both do for this city. When I got that call, and I said, they said that you two rushed to the aid of that elderly woman. And Jason, how you held her, you got on the ground, and you held her head, and you talked to her in Kevin. You immediately called 911.

            Councilor Wilson. Madam President, lots of good stuff happened in our community. Our Summer Pride seventh grade girls basketball team, as you mentioned, won that Metro West title earlier this year. I believe the first such title in over a decade for the program and I think only the third time in the 35 or so years that this has happened. So it's a big deal. It's an achievement worth celebrating here today and letting them know just how proud of them their community is.

            Congratulations. Colleagues, let's take a five minute recess. Oh, you're right. Yes, stick around. We're going to choose some photos in just one moment. Madam Clerk, let's read the next citation then. Item 5.1 is a citation by Councillor Printett and Newfeld, commending the Kiwanis Club on the auspicious occasion of its 100th anniversary of support to the community. 100 years, incredible. Yes.

            Madam Mayor, welcome. Thank you, Madam Mayor. So congratulations to the Quantice Club of Somerville on 100 years of service. Our city has changed a lot since 1925, but your support to our residents has been steady and unwavering. Toys and backpack drives for families and needs, scholarships for our youth. Thanksgiving dinners for seniors, even karaoke.

            I'd like to thank the Mayor and the City Councils. Some of who I was 100 years ago didn't figure that in 2025 would still be around. But it's interesting that when you are giving back and doing something good, because that's how it all started, some business people wanted to do some good. One of the first programs was a Christmas program for underprivileged children.

            And we still continue that to this very day. But it isn't just small children, kids in middle school. How wonderful it is that the sumble girls pride basketball team won this fabulous championship. But it was maybe about 12 years ago or so that the sumble who won this club held a pancake breakfast at the Mount Vernon restaurant to raise money

            That's something special, it really is. There are a lot of service clubs and some of them, and they're all great. Some of them is definitely hands-on. It wasn't that many years ago that our past president, Eleanor Brian, a former school teacher, was at the some of the public school, the library, the children's room, and at that time it was in pretty tough shape.

            Thank you. Councillor Chazo. Might as well go around the horseshoe. So, almost former Madam President, I am not happy that you are leaving, but I respect and honor your decisions. I thought you were a true leader on the council.

            I thought I always appreciated your thoughtfulness on finding solutions to unite us as a body, which, as Councilor Klingin said, with another year, I would have liked to see how that would have possibly even been a ritual. True leaders can unite.

            And false leaders try to create dissonance. You were true leadership from little gifts when we celebrated births of children or birthdays with cupcakes. And then possibly the bust cupcake I've ever had from Arlington. Don't tell anyone, but it was fantastic. But those little touches matter.

            and people's lives. And you did that, and I'll never forget. And I told the story numerous times, but it was one of my favorite moments of early service with you. You were not yet on the council. It was during pandemic. I think it was my first term, and it was in the center. No, it wasn't even the center of the pandemic. It was the beginning, and it was just a horror show every day.

            And it was my first couple of months on the council, dear God. And one of the first things I wanted to do as a counselor was bring dignity matters to Somerville. I know we've talked about this a few times, but

            It just demonstrated who you are. Dignity matters is pre-menstrual products for the lowest income of residents. And some reveal was on a waiting list to get a pre-menstrual products into the food pantries. And it was just twiddling our thumbs and hoping that maybe one day soon it could happen. And I called you, Judy.

            And I said, here's what I would like to do, but we're on a waiting list. Is there any, like, how can, what can we do? And he said, hmm, let me think of something. And you did, and within, I don't know, it wasn't even, it was a week. It was possible, and it happened, and it changed lives, because those simple solutions changed lives. You're true later. So, I'm gonna miss you on the council. Thank you.

            I am personally offended that you're leaving. No, just kidding. I'm really sorry to see you go. It was honestly surreal to watch you come onto the council as a new counselor. Brand new and immediately were just a total pro. That was not what it was like when I came on myself. I came on with a bunch of new counselors. I know that that is not typically how it goes. It was really, really, really.

            just extraordinary to watch. You immediately understood what you were here to do, how to do it, how to get things done. We worked together as President and Vice President. For two years it was just a total pleasure. The fact that you were elected as Vice President like six minutes after getting onto the council I think just reflects that we all really just respect you.

            I have always been really impressed at how you get stuff done. It was really fun to work together on the overturning the no more than four adults, which had been this long-term issue and once you were on the council it was just like that.

            It was also really noteworthy. There were obviously times when you and I were on totally different sides of a vote, an issue, it never mattered at all. You were always completely kind, willing to work together in public and private. That is something I do not take for granted. It is really, really important. As you know, we're going to miss you on the council. We're very excited to see what you do next. Councillor McLaughlin.

            Thank you, Madam President, for the last time. I'm sad to see you go as well. And this job is a labor of love, but it is a labor at times. And it can take a toll on family, on your private life, things like this. And one of the things that

            You know, one of my least favorite aspects in every level of government is performative politics. And the thing that I give a compliment to you for is I never felt like you were a performer, you were just a steady grinder, doing the work, doing the labor of love, not really seeking too much credit for it either, not getting headlines, not getting a lot of

            accolades that you should get. So I'm going to give you the accolades now because it's hard to find steady, dependable, reliable people who are willing to sacrifice their time and put their name out there and subject themselves to abuse sometimes as well. So it's going to be hard to replace you. I hope we get someone good to replace you but it's going to be difficult and I will tell just one story just to show how reliable you are.

            that happened very recently where we had the charter meetings and we had an unexpected meeting for the charter that happened at a time when you had a long planned vacation and you phoned in. Your vote was not needed that night.

            But you want it to be there, to be a part of a historic moment that meant a lot to me personally and will hopefully mean a lot to the city in general.

            you weren't expecting to have to do that. And that's just one small example. And there's other examples where you just always made things about human beings, about the people who need your help. And that's what I'm going to miss the most.

            Got to just tack on all that. Where'd you want a cruise ship when you called in? Because that's not cheap. You got to, you got to, that's expensive.

            Yeah, Madam President, we came in together as freshmen counselors. I really appreciate your willingness to step up and lead. I know there were some challenging moments here that you found yourself having to preside over. I really appreciate your thoughtfulness towards City staff. I learned from you a perspective that you brought as a former City staffer. It influenced

            When I came on, I was inclined to just put in orders. And from conversations with you, I changed that approach. And I became inclined to talk to staff first before putting in order.

            Once you got in, I'm sure, partly because of a lot of conspiracy theories installed like that. I'm beginning with a little challenging, but I think, you know, as a person, I've seen just how professional you've carried yourself.

            As colleagues have mentioned, they've been some challenging meetings that, and you did a really great job presiding.

            Council Scott. Madam President, it's been mentioned before, but I don't think you'd be overstated how important it is and how useful it is to have that perspective of working in government at multiple different levels and multiple different roles. And I think that's something that you brought to this job, obviously from day one. And I think the city's better off for it. I also don't think people understand sometimes just how hard it is to be a ward counselor. And especially how hard it can be.

            We almost got through this without the pit. No, no. And I just wanted to say, all jokes aside, it is, I know how hard it is to walk away from the neighbors and the people that you have given up so much to work for, to support, to represent.

            I don't really know what this job is, and I really know how I'm going to balance it with my other client work. But I have to do this because I care that much about the city. And I remember him joking, well, how much of our apartment is going to be taken over by COVID materials? And I said, I don't really think that's the job. And then a week later, the fire department delivered 8,000 masks to my apartment.

            Thank you for the honor of serving as a city councilor, it's been one of the greatest privileges of my life. To represent a city I love, to represent a city that believes in big ideas and small actions and that fights for justice while caring for all of our neighbors.

            I ran for office because of my experience during COVID, because I love this community, because I believe that local government at its best is where change is personal, tangible and bold. And because I truly believed in my heart that together we can make summerville more equitable, more inclusive, and more compassionate and kind. And you all know, I don't need to go through the list of accomplishments of this council over the last four years, but it's been extensive.

I mean, I can go on and on, but also prioritizing language justice, which was so important to me, raising the bar for our city workers with a better contract, defending our status as a sanctuary in welcoming city.

            But Somerville, it's a city that's not just defined by policy, it's defined by its people. And I went last night for the July Firework celebration. And I just was reminded as I was walking through Broadway, why I fell in love with Somerville. There were kids all over with sticky fingers from the ice cream melting off of their ice cream cones. Our seniors that were dancing to Motown like no one was watching, families sprawled on picnic blankets,

I heard folks talking about their experience trying to find an apartment, just Eve's dropping, talking on the street. It was an imperfect, like, joyful, messy, special, magical night, which is what is Somerville at its best.

            And yet when you love something so deeply, you have to accept the pain and heartbreak that comes with that love. Pain like hearing about our residents, they're being priced out. Pain like hearing about the small business owners that need to close up shop. Like a literal conversation I had this morning in Teal Square with a business owner that's looking for another place to go, because they just can't afford to stay here anymore.

            Stories like our immigrants that are afraid to go to ESL classes because of the current political environment. Stories from families at my daycare who just can't afford to be here anymore. That pain and heartbreak is why I got into this work. It's why so many of you serve on this council as well.

            Here's that charge. I'm asking you to not lose sight of why you're here. That it's not about the power of this horseshoe or pride or personal comfort. It's for them, it's for the kids chasing bubbles, the seniors leading the dance floor, the working families trying to stay in their homes. It's for neighbors who don't always show up to our meetings, but who you're impacting every day by the decisions you make.

            Don't forget that your responsibility is not about power, but it's to people, including our city staff. It's not to self-preservation, but to service. Our responsibility is not to political comfort, but it's to moral courage.

            One of the lessons I learned is that the loudest voices are often not the most impacted voices. They're not always the most vulnerable voices. Be brave enough to listen. Be brave enough to ask the hard questions. Put aside personality and put community first. Center equity not just in your language, but in your decisions, your votes, and your vision. Because our neighbors are depending on us to do that.

            The municipal resolution before you would show that Somerville supports the bill. And I'm asking you to join Boston, Cambridge, Medford, and other municipalities in seeking to make the larger fuels companies pay for efforts to mitigate the effects of climate change.

            The bill applies widely. The monies could be used to update systems as varied as sores and bridges, school buildings and public housing, and the electric grid. In addition, it can be used to combat heat island effects, as well as climate-related threats to our forests and food systems. I'm very pleased personally to note that 40% of the money is designated

            It's clear that mitigation efforts will be extensive and expensive to reach our 2050 energy goals. Even if we eventually get help from the state, it hasn't happened yet. And perhaps even from the federal government under a different administration, we still won't have enough money to meet our needs.

            That is where this bill comes in. The large fossil fuel companies have reaped huge benefits over the years by ignoring their own scientists. Years ago, the scientists at these companies told them what was going to happen and their predictions were eerily, eerily true. They really come true.

            The fossil fuel companies could, at that point, have pivoted to become the leaders in developing renewables. They could have actually taken over that whole solar and wind and everything and reaped huge profits and done very well by themselves. But it wouldn't have been, it would have involved some change, some investments and so on. They didn't choose to do that. They chose just

            to make the money that they could make at that time and go for it. The Make polluters pay bill is designed to make the largest fuel companies pay a small portion of their huge profits to mitigate some of the damage that they cost. It won't be enough, but it will really help. And I'm therefore asking you to vote for the Climate Change Superfund Bill Resolution that's before you. And thank you for giving me my time.

            is our unwavering commitment to education. The 7.4% increase in school funding all told continues a remarkable trajectory. Since I took office, we've increased school funding by 34%. That's not just an investment in our children's education today. It's an investment in their future.

            The Educator's Union contract has achieved its intended purpose. Those dollars will be folded into the budget, contributing to 7.4% total increase.

            There is no need to resort to a move like this one that carries so many unintended consequences, and I have to share one more thing I hope you can understand.

            Madam President, I've had multiple colleagues indicate to me after Tuesday nights meeting that they might want to reconsider their vote on an item from Tuesday. So I'll just make sure that everyone feels confident in their vote. I'd like to move to sever item 6E13 from the report of the Finance Committee and take that up separately for a vote. Okay.

            Thank you, Madam President. So, thank you to the good Council for listening to colleagues and bringing this forward. I wasn't my request, but not to, I still want to mislead anybody. I wasn't going to say anything about this, but after hearing the mayor's statement, I feel compelled to on a variety of levels. And frankly, I don't know where to start. I'll start by taking a step back.

            I may, I still have not fully decided I'm going to hit the discussion here. But to the extent I'm considering switching my vote, it is entirely based on a very reasonable, very rational conversation I had this morning with a member of the Department of Intergovernmental Affairs. I will say that nothing that the mayor just said compels me at all. And in fact, it just, I find it really disappointing.
        </div>

        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="4551.86" data-end="4570.085">

            Last year, the dollars that correspond with this position were cut from the budget. We were then subjected to a show that the administration put forward putting an individual up here to plea for their job.
        </div>

            It was the administration that made it about the individual last year, and it is the mayor's comments that are the only thing that is making this about an individual this year. This is not about an individual. The Council's vote has nothing to do with the individual holding this office. The Council's vote is to cut dollars from the budget. That is one of the only powers that we have as Councillors.

            And I've heard arguments that, well, if this cut holds then in a week, there's someone who won't be able to get a paycheck. I don't believe that's true. And even if it is, that can't be the reason we can't cut positions. It is a longstanding understanding, forgive the clunky phrasing, that this is one of the only things that the council can do is cut dollars from the budget. And if it happens to correspond with a position, then that's how it works.

            I completely agree that this type of thing should not be done based on an individual. It should not be done based on job performance. That would not be appropriate in my opinion. It's certainly not the reasons that I voted for this motion the other night. I voted for this motion because

            I have never felt that this position was appropriate or necessary. I went along with it. It's on several occasions for a variety of reasons. I didn't argue to pull it out of the charter, although I was inclined to, because it was clear to me that if I had done that, the mayor would never have signed the charter, and it would not be in Beacon Hill right now. I did not bring the motion to take it out of the budget, because frankly, I thought that might lead us to where we are right now.

            But when the question was put before me, I had to, as I always have vote honestly, and based on how I feel, which is that this is not how we should be spending the taxpayer's dollars. I'm not going to argue to you all to put this, to change your votes, or to put the position back in, if that's the will of the council, fine. I don't think it's that critical an issue.

            But I just have to come back to the fact that it is once again the mayor's office and this type of mayor herself who is making it about an individual. And that is really, really, really unfortunate. And I'm just so disappointed that after what we went through last year, what everybody went through last year, including the individual who happens to hold this position and who I believe, I have every reason to believe is doing their absolute best at the position based on the guidance and leadership that they have.

            that it's now being made about that individual again, because from my standpoint as one counselor, that has nothing to do with this vote. And it's just, I find it unacceptable and really disappointing that the mayor is trying to turn this conversation into it being about an individual person, because it is not. I'll say just one more thing.

            What is stated in the charter is not the same as this position. This is a position that the mayor created, that the council voted to include the funding in the past. What is in the charter is a charter-creator position with council confirmation. A person in that role may well do many of the same things, although a future mayor may direct them to do different types of things. I don't know. But it's not the same position. It's not the same entity in terms of how it exists in the context of our city government.

            If the charter that is on Beacon Hill has passed, if this money were to stay out of the budget and the mayor were to decide to accommodate that cut by removing this position, and the charter was passed, I would expect to see a request for the salary for the position that's created to the charter. And having gone along with the charter, I would vote for it. I wasn't going to say anything about this tonight. I really wasn't.

            But the statement that we just heard, I compelled me to speak and to respond because I think that it's important that we as a body maintain our position and the limited authority and living to power that we have to cut funding from the budget. And if that budget, if that funding happens to correspond to a position, then it is up to that department head to decide what to do.

            It can't be the answer that we can't cut a position because then a week later in July will have difficult time making the numbers work. That can't be the right answer.

            I could not agree more that the council can cut the budget, can cut positions, can cut funding. I don't think there's any debate about whether we can do that. There are also very specific consequences for those actions, clearly, and I think

            It's hard, I think, if the council is going to take an action that has the effect of cutting the exact salary amount of one member of the administration, it's very clearly interpreted that way by the public, the administration. I don't really see that in bad faith. And I think if the council wants to do that, the very least that the council should do is deliberate on that and clearly express what is happening. I'll just be really frank.

            When there was no deliberation on this motion and I went to a vote, I assumed that was because it was going to fail overwhelmingly. That's what I thought that meant. I was like, I don't want to have the same conversation we had last year, I thought we all kind of landed on the same place. The fact that we could take that vote literally just without even discussing it, I don't think that's good. I know for a fact,

            I've heard from city staff just the effect that that has on them kind of psychologically and more L level that's not me speculating that that's very real I take those consequences really seriously. I think it's absolutely the case that we can cut positions. But we need to take that with the seriousness that it deserves and that to me at the very least like I would like to hear

            Councillor Clingon. Thank you, Madam President. Through you, I was one of those people that, you know, we did very little deliberation. The whole thing was about 120 seconds. Coming off of what happened last year, it's not a direction I necessarily would have went in. I agree with everything that's being said here, though, as far as being able to cut positions and whether or not, you know, in the position is a different position in the charter. And I also don't

            Davis is saying and I also agree with the intention of the cut to some degree in that I Have never been a hundred percent behind this position as to whether or not it's integral or how important it is and I remain concerned with You know and maybe I'm one of those people that maybe I need to go up to the mayor's office

            Yeah, Madam President, I don't blame anyone at this horse here right now who's feeling upset with what they heard a short time ago. I would just urge colleagues to put emotions aside here, look at this dispassionally. I spent Tuesday afternoon up at the State House, testifying in support of our proposed charter home rule petition. I don't want to see us take any action here.

            that gives Beacon Hill any reason to not approve that horrible petition that we spent so much time on. In fact, I really hope they're not paying attention this week to what's going on around here. I just, yeah, I would urge people to just put a motion aside on this one. Councillor Bough.

            I guess the way I came to this, I'm glad that the good consular from Wattry, you know, asked about how people came to this decision. And of course, I, for instance, I've really never had a lot of connection with the Central Administration. I guess they have a different style of operating.

            I spoke with the mayor, you know, I felt I was grateful that she called and I've never really seen her like really fiercely advocating for something. But I explained to her, I'm like, Madame Mayor, I don't like feel like

            your administration is out there communicating, having that. So even when I cut, when I supported this position last time, I had no clue who the chief administration officer was until that conversation we were deliberating the issue. So for me, it's about, first of all, when you have people that are engaged with the councilors, we have this conversation. It's easier to understand what they do, their roles and responsibilities.

            I also share my priorities, my frustration, things that I'm trying to deal with. But it's been, so last year when we cut this position, I went, spoke to the various department ahead and said, this is the way I operate. Again, I've always talked about conspiracy theory. It exists. It's fully operational. But I said, this is the way I want to operate. Let me get to know you, know your work, and so on. We went out once.

            And then after that, I've never seen this person. So I almost thought they left the city because you don't even see the conversation. And I realized that I had an issue with certain departments and try to be very cautious in terms of how I'm addressing these issues. And I actually realized that, okay, let me send the chief, I mean, the office of probably should be the one I should direct this. Maybe the chief of staff, but I wrote a long,

            with the intention that this person, if it's a fully functional operation, but don't pick up the phone and just call me and say like, hey, well, you know, I see that the second issue, you know, like, how do we, it's just simple as that. And all I got was

            All I got was, good afternoon, text received, councilor. I said, wow, you know, it's, I don't know, it's like, I just, but I guess after speaking with the mayor today, it just for me, it's like, also feel like we supported each other.

            with this position, also don't want it to fail at the state house. And hopefully, you know, when we have this conversation enough time, it will actually change some things. People will actually start to take initiative

            and try to get to know us and know our priorities and see how we can work together because we are not working against each other. So this is just how I was frustrated in terms of just the communication. Even part of the recent fallacies, they said, oh, they will communicate better.

            We've got a lot of surprises in the finance department, you know, with communication. But I'm not going to dwell on that. That is not about the persons, about just the office. So, but for now, for the sake of passage of the city charter, I think I will also, you know, like let this position slide through. And so I will be switching my body and support of the position.

            Councilor McLaughlin. Madam President, I agree with all of you. Let me say, first of all, I don't appreciate what was just said. I have to just say that. And I'm voting against this cut. I'm not going to shame anybody who voted for this cut because I made this cut last year. And I gave my reasons. I said lack of communication from the IGA's office.

            lack of negotiation with unions, and the charter is not done, which had the IGA, which had the CAO position in it. All of those have been satisfied by me. So that's why I'm not supporting the cut this year, because the reasons I gave for supporting the cut last year don't exist now. So I'm not going to make up new reasons, and I'm not going to say nothing either, and just vote on it. So I'm satisfied enough

            to not support this cut, but I do understand people's frustrations with this position, not the individual, this position, and with what we just discussed, because I think a lot of this council about just made a point is like

            I think the issue is that there isn't an open door policy. Clearly, the door is clearly closed. There's a glass door now instead of a wooden door, but the door is not open. And I think it's that lack of communication that brings us to this point where people are willing to vote without saying a word about how they feel on it because they figured it's over, like what's done is done. So I want to put that out there because I

            I felt ashamed and embarrassed for my vote last year, for starting the fire to begin with, and then felt less than 24 hours later, completely validated by my beliefs. But, and I've had several people in the city actually thank me for making this an issue, in which I'll leave that in the air for people. But, I am going to put my personal feelings aside, put my pride aside, and just say, these are the reasons I said I don't support this position.

            The reasons have been addressed, so I'm going to vote and keep this position. Councillor Scott. Thank you Madam President. I got to be honest, I thought I would probably be the first one to have a move for reconsideration and I hope that reconsideration prevail.

            But I am very glad, because it sounds like that's the motion that is about to be before us, that we're doing that. Because that's what a city council does. That's what a legislative, deliberative body does. It's, in fact, our only job. And whether or not people thought in that moment, it needed another two hours of discussion, or felt that all of the hours of discussion and years of experience of the thing.

            allowed them to vote from an informed position. Either way, it's an acceptable flow for how this chamber operates. As much as I know, I am not everybody's favorite colleague. As much as I know that this body can be a difficult one to work with, I believe that we are not just

            as a city, but as a society, really seeing the importance of the independence of branches of government. So I don't have anything to say about the motion that was made, the vote that was taken on either way of it. I think we make motions all the time. We vote on them. And then we all move forward to try to build the best city we can, to take care of our neighbors as best as we can. And I think the disrespect

            that was just expressed is corrosive. Because it's not just disrespect of the individual people around this horseshoe, but really the idea of the legislative branch and its responsibilities in its entirety. So I think that is deeply unfortunate. I think it's deeply disappointing.

            I wasn't a staff member paid by the city during COVID, but for two years, for two budget cycles, I was a contractor and I worked incredibly closely, side by side, every day with city staff on the ground who were working every single day to protect our families during the pandemic.

            I saw what they went through, the cut wrenching experience our city staff go through every budget season. Every department feels it, not just the police department, not just our CAO, not just the mayor's office. Every single department, and I'm sorry to speak for you all in the back of the room, but every single department feels the fear, the anxiety,

            the pit in their stomach during budget season because of the tone and tenor this council can sometimes take to our city staff that hasn't changed and in my experience on this council it's gotten worse. I think anyone sitting in the back of the room or listening in who works for the city, who saw what happened on Tuesday night is wondering if they're next.

            is wondering does every counselor know what I do? Does every counselor like me? Have I responded to every single counselor's text messages in a timely way?

            but I'm struggling to believe that it wasn't if the money that was cut on Tuesday night wasn't reallocated to any of the priorities that we've talked about as a council.

And I just want to remind you all on my last meeting that it's our job to figure that out. It's actually our job to understand the role, to ask questions. That's our role during budget season in addition to cuts.

            It's our job to ask those questions to reach out, to wonder, what are the priorities? Let me share my feedback with the mayor before budget season. Let me meet with folks to understand how this role intersects with other roles. As I have read and reread the job description, the home role, this position in particular,

            is an operations role. It would be like a COO at another, at a company or a big organization. It's just because it's in government it's the CAO. I'm actually really glad I don't see the COO around as a member of the legislative body. I'm not a member of the operations team in the city. I'm a legislator and so

            I understand that there are layers to city government, I don't see. There's a lot of city staff, I don't see in a day to day basis, doesn't mean I want to cut their job. And so I just urge you all to think about what our constituents are asking of us during budget season, what our constituents were choir of us, not just today, but the other 364 days of the year, as their representatives at this table.

            Because there are a lot of people not in this room. There are a lot of people not listening in. They're busy. They're feeding their kids. They're getting their kids to bed tonight. They're thinking, are they going to have a job tomorrow? Are they going to have money to pay rent? They're going to have money to pay groceries. But they're asking us to ask the hard questions about our budget. Make sure trash is going to get picked up. Potels are going to get filled with money for food insecurity, for our house neighbors, for all the issues and priorities that we care about.

            And we're spending a lot of time on what feels like a position that we may not know a lot about or may not understand that we debated for hours and hours a year ago, as you all know, you're all here for that. And I'm struggling to believe that this isn't personal. And I'm asking you to think about the city staff who are watching, who are wondering if they're next.

            So with all due respect, Madam President. Any time, if I'm going to be lecture two like that, I'm going to set the record straight. So just so you know, I do defend the city every single day. That is what our job is to do. We do understand what happens in the city. And quite frankly, I think what people are asking a lot of times is to cut more. And we don't. Basically, there's not much to cut. We respect the budget. We go through the budget and we were presented with a good budget.

            This is kind of going off the rails now a little bit. It's a little, it's a little bit offensive to me because I, I'm probably a cream puff counselor. I remember back in the days before all of us were on when like there was real like accountability where people were, you know, where there was a lot of emotion involved. I mean, I try to be extremely understanding. I don't think that I, I, I pressed just to have for or anything. I don't think I

            I asked for very much. I used 3-1-1 like a good boy. I don't know what to say after that. And we're trying not to talk about this and waste a lot of time. But as long as narratives keep getting spun, that I feel like I have to then come back and say something in defense. And people are applauding and stuff. And it's like, I think we all work well together here.

            I think I've worked well with many of you. I think I barely work with most of you. I don't bother anybody as a cowl to that much. Only when I need to get something done for constituents. So I'm sorry. It was tough to sit here and listen to that without getting emotional because every single day I'm out there defending what the city in China explains them, how understaffed we are and how understaffed we are and how we don't have Cambridge's money and how all of these things that I'm defending constantly because it's true and because I do care about the people in this room. So that's all I want to say.

            Thank you, Madam Chair. I was about to say pretty much the exact same thing. I'll keep it very short, but I just want to echo that. I said in constituents all the time that particularly when they're complaining, they're bringing concerns about lack of whatever they feel should be happening that their mind isn't as far as

            some department isn't doing something. And I emphasize that I promise you every single person in the government is working four times harder than they have any reasonable right to expect them to be. We need three more of everyone there. That's all the more reason why I felt like this particular position might be, these resources might be better used somewhere else. I'll just leave it at that. I think that

            I don't think it's fair to attribute the statements that have been made about this specific position to other members of the department because I don't think anyone has said anything that suggests that. I think we should call a question.

            Madam President, bigger picture budget time now. The finance committee has been busy as usual this month reviewing the proposed FY26 budget since the presentation of that proposed budget and the hearing on the school budget back on May 29th, we met on Tuesday, June 3rd for 55 minutes with all 11 Councillors present for the public hearing as required by ordinance. And then for three nights,
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="6220.072" data-end="6245.755">
            <span class="timestamp"><a href="https://somervillema.granicus.com/player/clip/2711?autoplay=1&entrytime=6220" class="timestamp-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[01:43:40]</a></span>
            for on June 10th for four hours and 18 minutes. June 16th, four hours and 42 minutes and June 18th for one hour and 51 minutes for what were the departmental hearings followed by this past Tuesday for 59 minutes as a committee the whole for cutnight. I want to thank this entire council as well as the members of the finance committee for their perfect attendance this budget season.
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="6245.755" data-end="6264.841">

            That's the first time I think that that's been the case during my time trying the finance committee and that's important. We tried a new approach this year at the suggestion of council staff where we skip departmental presentations and encourage councilors to pre submit any initial questions well ahead of the departmental hearings for staff to answer with memos.
        </div>
        </p>

            As I previously explained to this body, the goal was to save time, but also to give staff the opportunity to look up information that they might not know off the top of their heads, improving the quality of responses, and reducing the absence of staff telling Councillors they would have to get back to us with information. The budget hearings then could be used for follow-up questions or for any additional questions that have occurred to Councillors.

            Those of you who are on the council in 2022 might recall me telling you how we set a modern record that year for efficiency with a total of 40 hours and 53 minutes spent on reviewing the budget that year that dropped to 28 hours and four minutes two years ago with the introduction of that option to do pre-submitted questions and staff memos in response and declined slightly to 27 hours and 50 minutes last year.

            Well, the combination of this year's innovations to the process and the nature of this FY26 budget, specifically its resemblance to last year's budget, saw a major improvement in efficiency. Prior to tonight, we came in under 15 hours total spent in meetings on this budget. We talked during Charter Review about a more humane budget process.

            And between that meeting time efficiency and the quality of responses we're now getting in those memos, we birthed a much more humane process. This is my fourth and final budget season. As your finance chair, I want to express my appreciation for Budget Director Master Boney, his staff and everyone in finance, IGA for all the liaising that they've done, our city staff and department heads.

            Our City Council's Finance Analyst, Muhammad Odin, and our Legislative and Policy Analyst, Brennan Salisbury, and our Committee clerks for clerking all those meetings and my colleagues for going along with the innovations to the process these last four years.

            of how we go about this really important work of ours and then to chair these budget meetings in a fair, productive, and respectful way.

            Thanks. Thank you, Madam President. Through you, I want to extend my thanks and gratitude to the chair of finance for his superior leadership skills. His attention to detail is understanding of the city budget as a whole and his way to manage folks in such a way that nobody

            Because of how empathetic we are to staff and to everybody's time adopting this new way did cut it down to under 30 hours I've been on this council for a while I remember the days when it was a committee of the whole and we were here, you know, until midnight With a presentation from every department those presentations no longer happen.

            We got emails, we got public notice about things that were left off the table, money that should be allocated somewhere else. And I just think we're in really dark times right now as a city. And we're very fortunate to live where we live, to have the privileges and the money that we have here. But we're also being targeted as a city and as a region. And we're living in very dark uncertain times.

            So I was appreciative to see a budget that still reflects our values that still is making putting people first and doing what we can when we don't know where the money is going to come from in the future. So I attribute that. I credit that to the mayor and all the staff for making that happen and hopefully we're going to get through these tough years and we can get back to like this the number of things I requested this year that I did not get that I did not get and I accept that because I know that

            So thank you to everyone, despite the fights that we have, we're working as a city, we're one of the most productive cities in the country in my mind, and it's because of everybody here. The budget is not before us, so hold your speeches. We're going to get there. Just the committee reports, that's okay. Any other discussion on the committee reports? Councillor Vaughn.

            Thank you, Madam President. I just want to throw you to the chair. Thank you for your leadership as well. As a member of the finance team, I really admire the way you run those meetings. And even something as small as, you know, I had a bunch of items and I had a conflict. And I said, I trust your judgment, but the chair was so gracious to keep those items in committee to the next finance meeting, those little things.

            It shows that it's a sign of state's management, so thank you. Councilor Saib. Through you, Madam President, to our finance chair, I also want to take a moment to thank you for your outstanding leadership, for being a detailed, extremely organized, but also always willing to

            Wow, what a year, right? This is of my years on the Council of the EZ budget. I'll say that is a consequence of the changes that have been made by the good chair at large of the finance.

            I remember the first year that we got on and all of the changes to the budget that year and how a few of my colleagues who are being quite gracious right now were a little less gracious to the chair about the process, the ways that we handled questions, the way that we moved forward the budget. It wasn't me.

            It was everybody saying the nice things. But over the years, I feel as though each year has gotten better in terms of the efficiency, the process, the ease at which counselors can express their questions or comments. I will say, we did make zero cuts this year. We did spend the least amount of time on the budget that they've been record.

            To me, those two things are not always good things. So I do not want to equate efficiency simply with being a rubber stamp because that is not the role of this body. That said, I do appreciate the fact that the chair did take a lot of lumps over the years.

            in order to morph this into a more humane process. And I feel like we've gone to a much better place than the FY 23 budget, for example, which was a rough one. And one where we did have meetings that went past midnight and where colleagues were quite frustrated with the process with each other. And this

            Comparatively, this has been a much, much smoother year for the budget, in my opinion. And I do think a good deal of that rests on the shoulders of the chair of finance. So thank you for that.

            Okay, those committee reports are approved. Next item. Madam President, I do just want to clarify since only one of them I believe was read that that was on the committee reports item 6A through 6E. They have finance committee reports of June 3rd, 10th, 16th, 18th, and 24th. No, did. Councillor Wilson. Just want to make sure so now all those items are before us. That does put, I believe in nine items before this council for a vote that were discharged with no recommendation.

            So, Madam President, before we do that, can we please take up together all the FY 2026 budget items on tonight's agenda? That would be items 5, 2 to 5, 23, items 7, 6 to 7, 13, and item 10, 3. Yes, and item 10, 3 is the budget, so this is the time if you have a speech to make it about the budget.

            Before we do that, can I move to place, there are two items that are being replaced with corrected versions. So I'll move to place on file items 5, 4, and 6E12. Place those items on file and I'd like to recognize budget director Meshaboni to speak on the budget first.

            You know, when we submit the budget, that doesn't mean it's totally done. Staff in the finance office, staff in every department are constantly reviewing budgets, making sure that all $380 million are exactly as we hoped. The memo that I just passed out, and that's been attached to the item in legislature, walks through those changes.

            as large as a couple unfunded positions and as small as $750 for OSHA certification. So the final budget grand total remains unchanged from the initial budget submission. The proportions are slightly different. So this memo walks through all those. If anyone has any questions, I'm happy to talk about those now. If not, I'm happy to sit down and start working on fiscal 27.

I just want to thank all of the, everybody in the administration who put, I know, unbelievable amount of time and work on this going back months and months and months and perhaps to the morning after last year's budget, apparently. That wouldn't surprise me at all. As well as my colleagues on the council who serve on the Finance Committee,

            And I'll speak to that issue just briefly and start. I'm going to start and then we'll come back and finish and if I forget to do that then know that I intended to come back and finish with this same point, which is that I'm incredibly impressed and grateful to Chair Wilson for.

            being brave enough to completely tear the process apart and reinvent it. With the help of the budget staff and many other members of the administration, I certainly have not necessarily agreed with all of the particulars of the approach over the years. And I share the concern that I think is a good Councillor at large made earlier that we should caution

            with just entirely equating efficiency and brevity with, you know, being a benefit. I think there's room for the pendulum to swing too far in one direction. But we very clearly are closer to the right spot now than we were when I joined the council 10 years ago and we spent, you know, June 1st, I'd, you know, tell my family I'll see them in a month. And we'd come up here and eat a bunch of good food and sit and learn a whole bunch of stuff about how they have the

            the city plans to operate in the next year and I say that because I think that the other point I want to make is that as we look at this process going forward, I do want to put the question out and this is not to suggest that I have a view on this. I just want all of us to think about how the process looks to the public and how it serves the public.

            and whether there might be a bit of transparency that perhaps we've lost in the way that the process works now. I don't know if there is. The answer to that may be absolutely not. This is great. But I just want to want everybody to think about that. I'll be interested in hearing folks' thoughts as we move forward into next year. But overall, again, here's where I come back to ending that. I remember to do it.

            To think that someone could come in and completely reinvent this process the way the council also has is I never would have believed it four years ago and yet here we are and so just an incredible tribute to you and again to everyone in the administration that helped and was a part of that process it just shows it's very brave and it shows great leadership so thank you for that.

Those are item 25-1079, repurposing $77,000 in the racial and social justice stabilization fund, 25-1080, appropriating $77,000 from the racial and social justice stabilization fund, 25-1095, repurposing and appropriating $40,500 from the COVID-19 stabilization fund.

            Madam Clerk, it's 17. Is this all part of the committee report or this is a new item that was submitted? Through the President, this is the seven items that I just read. Some of those were reported out of committees. Some of them were submitted the previous meeting and laid on the table. And some of them were submitted for this meeting today. You just voted to approve all of them. And now these are the ones that require a roll call vote.

            Okay, welcome back. Madam Clerk, next item please. Thank you, Madam President. The next item is going to be item 6F, a report of the committee on land use meeting on June 17th, 2025. Councillor McLoughlin. Thank you, Madam President. The committee of land use did meet on that time. All Councillors were present. We took up a number of good items here. We took up, let's see, let me sorry, one second.
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>

            So one, before we go, I'd like to sever an item from the committee report, item 250200. This is the Yimbi Dorma item that was placed on file, but the correct action should be to keep it in committee until it's placed on file. So we discussed this item. It was the planning board and the planning department had issues with this. The council spoke

        </p>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="9251.547" data-end="9269.401">

            Generally in support of the concept, but wanted to give deference in time to the city to maybe negotiate something with the sum of a Yimbi group. So we propose to keep this in committee so that I can run its course and then be resubmitted or renegotiated with the city. So I'd like this item to remain in committee.

            We took up the big summer and over items. All four amendments were before us and all four were approved. The big one being the arts and innovation sub-area for the master plan development overlay district. We had a thorough discussion about this again. Council UN camp and made a motion and amendment to guarantee that affordable housing would be built at this site.

            There were other technical amendments that kept the substance of the item still before us. We still did discuss the legitimate concerns about transportation and parking and traffic and whether this project will happen at all because even if it's zoned, it doesn't mean that it's going to happen. So we weighed the pros and cons and generally discussed that this council and our committee should not vote on this item based solely on any community

        </p>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="9319.013" data-end="9338.183">

            benefits or any negotiations made outside of the council but based on the merits of the zoning before us. We discussed that thoroughly and had a five to nothing vote in favor of it. We also discussed the three other amendments that were before us previously that we sent back to committee. No changes were made on those items but they were approved again.
        </div>
        </p>

            And then we had a brief conversation with Samantha Carr, a land use analyst who updated us on citywide zoning proposals. Through her, Mr. Dan Bartman, we learned that more housing is actually being built in the UR and N.R. districts, as opposed to the M.R. districts, which are on the main streets, which what we've been talking about when it comes to citywide zoning is building multiple stories close to transit. More housing has been built in the UR and N.R. district. Mr. Bartman attributed that to

            than being done as of right instead of needing a special permit. And we did discuss the issue, however, though, that changing things to you are or make an MR as of right may jeopardize our ability to enforce inclusionary zoning requirements. So that's a concern that we have, and we left that in committee, that item will be continued to be discussed.
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="9391.593" data-end="9421.293">

            And then we also had another item that was in committee before, building official to waive certain dimensional standards for means of egress. Council Wilson made an amendment to basically strike out the word possible and insert the language feasible without undue financial hardship. This was in reference to how do I explain that. There was basically to make sure that there would be more strict use of the

        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="9422.693" data-end="9440.834">

            I'll let council Wilson explain that in a minute. It's a little complicated there, but that was our committee report. We have another items and I submit this to be approved as submitted. Council Wilson. Thanks, my resident. I appreciate the chair's report on that. Yeah, just for some additional color that on that egress one.

            This is, it had come up in the public hearing actually, concerned that an interpretation, when someone went to go get the, basically the ability to put an egress, someone might say, well, you could, you could just put an elevator on the side. Why do you need to ramp in the front? And we felt that this language would make it very clear so that there would be no chance of an interpretation of, you know,

        </p>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="9461.033" data-end="9477.217">

            It's something that is not very reasonable. I would say forcing someone to put it in an elevator on the side of a building when a ramp in front might suffice would be unreasonable. So I was very happy with that outcome. And I appreciate the chair, indulgenous, sending that back to committee to make that change was a good outcome. Thanks.

            Councillor Scott. Thank you, Madam Chair. Just appreciative of all the work that the Land Use Committee has put in on this and also wanted to express my gratitude for taking it back into committee so that some potential changes could have been discussed there. And I'm very grateful that all of these items are recommended out for approval tonight. Once the committee report is approved, I'm hoping that we can take 25-0131 first.

            Okay. Any other discussion on the committee report? So, Madam Clerk, we'll send 6F5 back to committee. Thank you, Madam President. And with that approval of the committee report, that places four items before this council for ordainment. And by request, the first of those will be item 25-0131.

            I want to talk for a minute just in this form with the full council about sort of my thinking on this overlay district and sort of because I've made statements about my general approach to zoning and sort of looking, doing it proactively rather than reactively. The overlay is really the key thing in my mind that brings me comfort here. From purely from a zoning standpoint, obviously for practical standpoint, all of the work that the

            The word counselor has put in place and the community members and members of the administration to pick this up and really work towards something that hopefully is overall a good design. I recognize there definitely are still some

            And we've received the number of communications that are specific to the community benefits agreement that the neighborhood council approves recently. I'll repeat what I said in committee and that I heard other folks echo as well including the good chair just now.

            I know that that in no way influences my decision on zoning because that's about a project this is about zoning and what I said in committee for all I know 90% of the people that voted yes for that don't actually want the project to go forward they just if it does go forward they want the best deal they can get that might not be true either could be 90% the other way point is who knows why people would yes for that it's certainly I certainly don't take that as a okay therefore it's okay to vote for the zoning because there's a lot that can go into that

            I think the overlay though is the key here because it's the thing that takes this from just changing zoning based on a developer's request to changing zoning to enable something that has come out of a long community process that still has a lot of oversight and a lot of checkpoints along the way from the plan board from the Urban Design Commission.

            multiple additional opportunities for public input, for changes, for tweaks, for things that can happen. Anytime we're talking about changing zoning, any pictures you see, any plans, none of that means anything, right? Zoning is only the words in the zoning ordinance, and all the pictures and everything else, as we have learned sometimes the hard way in the past, can change. With the overlay, and Director Bartman walked us through this at the last committee meeting,

            I want to repeat my appreciation for that. There remains a number of additional steps here and additional public input and so that gives me the comfort that I needed to sort of get past my philosophical concerns about the approach. So I just wanted to acknowledge that if anyone sort of wonder where my thinking went. Thank you Madam President.

            I'm going to vote yes. I think for those of us in the politics business, this is what we call a tough vote, which has a specific meaning. It's something that's consequential, but it also means that no matter which way we vote,
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="9785.523" data-end="9805.283">

            There are going to be people who are frustrated with the outcome, even if you run out of the room and refuse to vote, right? Like this is something where people that we know and respect in our community are on opposite sides of this issue. And there's, I got very wise advice from my predecessor, Alderman Bob McWaters, when you have a tough vote, you have to listen.

            to all of the feedback that you get, and then you have to decide what you think is the right decision. And so I think this is a large vote, and I want to kind of share and walk through how I've approached it, if you'll bear with me. So for my point of view, this process really started almost two years ago, in the fall of 2023, the developers submitted their first version of this zoning proposal.
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="9828.149" data-end="9847.252">
            <span class="timestamp"><a href="https://somervillema.granicus.com/player/clip/2711?autoplay=1&entrytime=9828" class="timestamp-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[02:43:48]</a></span>
            And that was ultimately withdrawn in the face of a lot of community pushback. And I just recently re-read what I wrote at that time to my constituents. I wrote, I think it's a very good sign that the developer is going back to the drawing board and continuing to work with the various community groups before trying to move forward.
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="9847.252" data-end="9877.238">

            that I know is shared by others is that it is certainly reasonable to propose a larger scale development at this site, but the original plan was simply a non-starter based on the enormous amount of new parking spaces they were proposing, the lack of a commitment to include housing, in addition to the new commercial space, a mixed-use development, the lack of clear commitments to support the local arts community and the existing businesses, and lingering questions about whether the existing electrical infrastructure can even support the scale of the buildings that are being proposed. So that's what I wrote.
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="9877.238" data-end="9894.215">

            almost two years ago. And basically what I was trying to say, and I think a lot of people around this horseshoe were saying, was we wanted to see a lot more commitment to serious community benefits and hearing changes to the proposal to mitigate the concerns specifically really around traffic, I think.
        </div>

            And so that is what has happened over the last year and a half from my perspective. The city went about their own planning process, Mayor Valentine and the planning staff submitted the proposal as before us now in March of this year. There was a public hearing in late March. We heard a lot of feedback. And those of us in committee, we've had really long and detailed conversations, a huge amount of that was focused on traffic and parking. I was ultimately really impressed by the work that has been done in this proposal specifically to minimize traffic issues.

            These include one of the lowest parking ratios in the greater Boston area, a commitment to free shuttles to transit stops, a really aggressive mobility management plan that among many other things creates stop points after every phase. So this is four buildings, multiple phases. After every phase, the planning board can amend or not allow new parking to be built if the traffic issues are spiraling out of control. That's serious, in my opinion.

            We've also amended the zoning to make sure that it will definitely include a residential component. Instead of just allowing it, it requires it. I always believe that's really critical. And one thing about serving on the City Council in Somerville is that our constituents reach out with really smart, thoughtful lists of questions and requests for information.

            I have done my best to read every single one of those that we've gotten, and I really mean it when I say it. If there were concerns that were raised that I really could not answer and could not come up with a good explanation for, I would vote no. Definitely. There's no sort of dammically hanging over us. I very much consider this an open question until the very end of our deliberations.

            I've kind of sent out a very long explanation in my newsletter and I've shared that way too long, if anyone cares about the details of this, but I've tried to take those really seriously and I personally have felt satisfied that I can answer all of the hard questions that we've got about this.

            While we were working on the zoning, the Union Square Neighborhood Council, just to be very clear, a completely independent nonprofit coalition of residents, workers, volunteers, has been negotiating this community benefits agreement with the developer, which would go into effect if these developments happen.
        </div>
        </p>

            And honestly, it includes things that I'd just never even dreamed would be possible, like having gotten involved with local politics around the Union Square, and now seeing a number of other projects go forward. These were basically pipe dreams, a project labor agreement.

            a community center for Somerville youth that they have already demonstrated is a success, financial contributions to nonprofits, and then even the power of this independent group to regulate traffic issues separately from the cities process. So when I look back at what I said publicly,
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="10090.724" data-end="10114.855">

            that I wanted to see happen in this process, that has happened. I mean, I just take those as wins. I'm just kind of blown away by the work. It was not passive, right? It was really, really hard work that was done by this community to fight for these, in my opinion, just kind of extraordinary community benefits that are now included in this. So that's why I'm a yes.
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="10114.855" data-end="10139.56">

            And lastly, just, you know, my colleague in word six just mentioned this, an enormous amount of the feedback we've heard recently has been about the community benefits agreement. And so I just wanted to say a few words about that. In my opinion, there are people who are opposed to the development for any number of completely valid reasons. And they knew that if the community benefits agreement goes into effect,
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="10140.067" data-end="10169.007">

            really what that means is that there's a letter of support from the Union Square neighborhood council, right? Among all of the feedback we get from the public, one of the things we're going to get is a letter of support from the neighborhood council, and these arguments will be used in favor of the development. And so there was this fear that, you know, if you're opposed to the development, this community benefits agreement is going to be used to argue for it, so we're opposed, right? Totally respect and understand that. But my fear is that because this was kind of the first opportunity that the public had to oppose the development,
        </div>

            I think a lot of kind of unfair shade was cast at the neighborhood council that honestly should be going to us. You know, we, this is not in my self interest to say, but we are the elected officials who are voting on the zoning. We are held accountable by elections every two years. We sign up for this job to take this kind of public feedback and criticism. The neighborhood council there. I just, I think that some of the kind of shade thrown at them has been

            I hate to say this, it should be directed at me, and all of us, rather than at the neighborhood council, who are, you know, they're just, they're volunteers who have given hundreds of hours of their time to try to make sure if this project happens, that the benefits, the economic benefits of this development are shared more equally in the city. So I'm very, very thankful to everybody who's been involved in this. I know that, you know, there are people who are gonna be disappointed in this vote, but that's why I'm supporting it, and I wanted to share all that.

            those concerns, but clarified that they're not questioning the integrity of the election nor the work of the USNC, who by all accounts have really closely followed their bylaws and they agreed upon eligibility requirements for that vote on the CBA. But still, I know the criticism stings for USNC members, I know it's because they've told me that. And especially after the extended and really excellent work that they did negotiating those community benefits.

            For the past weeks, I've been working on trying to address the neighborhood concerns I've heard about things like the step back, the lodging use, traffic impacts, construction impacts. I'm satisfied with the changes that we've made to the proposed zoning that addresses the first two of those. I appreciate the efforts by both the developer and by city staff to address the traffic piece at an earlier stage than when it's really supposed to happen. I still have concerns, but I'm going to trust city staff in the planning board to ensure that those targets are hit.

            Ultimately, I've been reminding myself lately that unlike other projects where a development gets built and then sold, this developer intends to lease those residential commercial spaces and be there. They have existing commercial tenants who will be there throughout construction.

        </p>

            They're going to have every incentive to want to minimize construction impacts on the neighborhood. And if they want to bring in tenants and keep them there commercially in the new space, they're going to want to make sure that it's not a traffic nightmare as well. They're going to find it's going to be tough to get people to want to go work somewhere and tough to have tenants if it's impossible to get to. So in that respect,

            their interests should be aligned with the neighborhood's interests, and I'm placing my faith in that, and I'll be watching to see how this unfolds in the years to come, but yes, I'll be voting support of this as well.

            So this zoning flanked by a landmark community benefits agreement, like the Good Counselor's, you know, from what three mentioned, and the project level agreement, you know, creates a rare opportunity to move from conflict to collaboration. And to bring real public benefits, like local jobs, youth pipelines, art space, and a climate tech cluster, that will expand our commercial tax base.

            This is something that some of the audience needs as lab vacancies grow and fiscal pressures mount. So that's it. I also want to recognize the process wasn't flawless. So we should learn from that and commit to doing better.

            That's why I also support the creation of an independent oversight committee, ideally including members who oppose the project to ensure transparency, monitor implementation and hold all parties accountable, moving forward. I want to highlight and on the score is that participation is the price of progress.

            I appreciate not being first out of the queue here. I'm old enough to remember what land use committee looked like before we started videotaping all these meetings. And I honestly think it's a shame that folks can't see how amazing and impressive the land use committee is now. Now I'm also old enough to remember when it was what the ward counselor said went.

            And I'm grateful for all the work that's been done by the members of the committee to not just take a developer at their word or city staff at their word, but to really, truly delivery and do the work of this body in a really impressive way. I'm in favor of passing this. This is the end result of

            over a decade of organizing, not to mention the last two years of work that people have been putting into zoning and the community benefits agreement and the project labor agreement. I think this is, as my colleague, from up the hill said, and full of absolute wins for the community.

            ensuring compliance with the terms of the various agreements, ensuring that the process continues with individual building site plan approvals over the next many years, where there will be even more opportunities for public engagement.

            I've had the honor and privilege to get to preside over a lot of those in Ward two over the last eight years. And, you know, this is the best one yet, and I know the next one's going to be better because we are always looking to improve. So, this has my full support.

            Thank you, Madam President, I also support it. Got so much to say, but first I'll say, you know, I'm very happy to have shepherded this process, but many, many other people did a whole lot more work than me, particularly the Wood Counselors and the Neighborhood Council. I end Rafi as well for actually sitting at the table and negotiating with the city. I do want to address the item that's been discussed a few times that I didn't want to talk about was this, the election, which people have

            The ballot referendum, whatever you want to call it, which people have cast aspersions on has no impact on my vote. I personally actually think it was an unnecessary step to have a vote like that, especially with a two-thirds threshold. I would have been disappointed if it failed with 35% of the vote, and I'd be expected to vote against something because like a smaller group of people,

            said not to. I'm a fully functioning elected official with my own mind. I have the ability to look at a deal and decide whether I think it's good or not for the community. And my role I felt was to just let these negotiations play out, let the neighborhood have a voice. And then when they were done with that come to us and we decide for ourselves whether this is a good deal.

            I think it's a good deal. And I would say that by looking at history, the brief history that I have been a part of on this council, particularly votes around Assembly Square and Union Square, which many people celebrated and I felt like bitter defeat at times.

            Eminent domain seizures, millions of dollars of city funds allocated to a developer so they can make money and they absolutely brought benefits to the community.

            And I did not see them in those debates and conversations. It was about the future. It's about the sum of all the future. And not the people here right now. And I'm very proud if I had any role in this at all, was not now, but years ago, fighting with the community.

            to have higher standards for development and have higher community involvement and that's what makes me immensely proud of this and again I think the other counselors who live in that neighborhood represent that neighborhood they did the really hard work but I'm very proud that we've set a new standard in the city and that people know that you know I saw all I cared about was

            Are you coming to the table with the community? Are you negotiating with the community? And then I will decide for myself whether I thought those negotiations were in good practice and they were. I saw people who spoke against this project at the first public hearing supported afterwards because negotiations were made, compromises were made. This did not happen in Union Square or assembly. We were walked on. We had to

            people had to find moratoriums and I last saw like all sorts of issues that just made people in the community rightfully feel like maybe this isn't the city for me anymore. I feel very different about this project. I think this project says that this is our city that developers have to meet our standards that we're not just going to give them what they want and beg for scraps, tangible community benefits here that are going to impact people that I care about so I'm happy to support this.

One of the things Councillor Scott said was something with the means being recorded. That is true. They've been recorded since I think 2018 or 2017. But what's even cooler right now, after COVID, is that because it's a five person committee, we can't

            Thank you Madam President. Being on land use I've heard from so many constituents were not necessarily in my ward. I tried to listen to all the concerns and answer questions.

            Yeah, so having heard from so many folks, spent a lot of time wearing the flowers and cons and they appreciate the mobility department presentations, especially regarding traffic mitigation and also traffic during construction. This was probably the biggest concern they've been hearing from constituents.

            And also my concern, we had a chance to ask questions and hear from Rafi and may appreciate their presentation and their willingness to incentivize the tenants to switch to more environmentally friendly modes of transportation. I think I am satisfied with the traffic mitigation plan, as others have mentioned,

            parking spots it will happen in four phases and at any point during those phases if the reports that are submitted by the developer are not satisfying the planning board can always reconsider that and yeah.

            ask the developer to not build more. So yeah, therefore, I'm satisfied. And yeah, another point is the community benefit agreement. We're all aware of all the wins and from that and also the project labor agreement, I think there are two things to celebrate and it does set a really good precedent.

            Thank you, through the chair. Yeah, yeah, guys. I remember when I first joined this council back in 2022, when you're a new counselor, a lot of folks want to talk to you, they want to show you around, they want to give you a preview of the work to come down the years. And I remember the first time I stepped on the Rafi campus, got a tour, looked around, was very impressed by what had been built.

            And we're speaking to some of the same people in this room. And I remember being asked specifically about a potential project, a potential up-zoning

            and what it would take for me as a counselor to support it. This was the first time I'd ever, as a counselor, spoken to a developer. It was not something that, you know, when I was planning to become a counselor, I planned to do very much or wanted to do was not the reason I, you know, joined this body, frankly. But I remember clearly the conversation that we had and the response that I gave was, get the community on your side,

            get a CBA, and you'll have my support. That was three years ago. In many, many processes, many, many constituency groups from artists to environmentalists, to local business owners, to what butters, to the thousands of people that will be impacted by both

            this project, the zoning, this CBA, and this PLA. And although I'm not ever someone who is fully satisfied with anything, frankly, and I do recognize that there are still legitimate concerns, both with process retrospectively and process moving forward.

            I was very clear with everyone in the community what my standard for this vote would be, and it was, give the community on your side, and I'll be on your side, because I'm with the community. And now that we're here, I'm gonna keep true to my promise, and I'm gonna support what the people of War II and III and beyond fought for in this agreement, and I'm gonna honor that with my yes vote.

            Director Galaghani, I believe I saw, and if I may, Madam President, through you, that any summer of the resident can ride the transportation provided from employees. Director Galaghani. Yes. There's a question directed to you.

            Through the President. Could you repeat the question? Yes, absolutely. Madam President, through you two, Director Galgani. I wanted to confirm on record that every summer of ill-resident can ride the transportation from public transport from any T-line or coming back and forth from the summer NOVA or from Rafi properties if they provide transportation. I'm going to allow Rafi properties to answer that. Yeah. The answer is yes.

That's why I'm asking you. Thank you. Raffee Properties has just confirmed that, yes, the shuttles that they are proposing as part of the mitigation and the mobility movement in that project will be available to every resident in the city and probably every non-resident too.

            The this this has been an issue for a long time, but right now there is a Extremely inspired group of advocates who are working to light a fire under us, which I very much appreciate the more the merrier And so I'm hoping this can go to traffic and parking and so that we can get an update it is my understanding that the city has brought on a

            Thank you, and I'd like to sign on to this, and I'm grateful that we're talking about it again because it's a very, very dangerous corner. And I've done it on a cargo bike, and it's virtually impossible to make the turn on a cargo bike.

            I don't know. I'm not really creative, but I swear I'd be inspired to just take a jackhammer and just use my own cement and it's terrible. And at crafty solutions, but it has to be fixed sooner than later. It's dangerous, and I am worried about someone getting really hurt or maimed. We have to fix it immediately. Council about like to sign on as well.

            This item is approved and sent to shopping and parking. Item 4.4 is in order by Council UN campin that the director of mobility install watch for bicycle signage for each street that intersects with the two bicycle lanes on central street. Council UN campin. Thank you Madam President.

            There's now a bike lane that goes against traffic on central. And so for cars, especially coming out of those side cross streets there, Cambria, given those streets, it might not be natural to look for the bikes coming because the traffic is only coming from one way, but the bikes are coming from the other. There may already be plans underway to put this signage in that the project is only now wrapping up, but this is something I'm quite concerned about and accident happening. So I just put this in to emphasize the importance of this issue and I asked that it be approved.

            Yeah, so for this one, this past week, it was a big planned project in McGon Square, and I heard from small businesses they have not been notified. So I would like to hear from the Director of Economic Development about it. So this will be sent to what committee? Probably housing community development.

            Thank you, Madam President. I would suggest housing and community development, unless you're in public council or two councilor Poseid to create a councilor's site that I'm happy to take it in housing and community development. And we have discussed similar issues in other parts of the city where local small businesses literally have to shut down for a couple of days because there is a lot of construction having immediately outside the doors.

            It's on their busiest days and they didn't learn about it until the day the pounding started. So it's a actual action has to be taken on this. In more communication, I'm happy to take an announcing community development, but Madam President, through you to Councilor Sight, if you wish to discuss it in public utilities.

            I think as long as the director shows up and we can have a director there and have a plan. I saw Councillor Pinarene who felt you put in a similar request that's more detailed. Where would that be because I thought they could just kind of. Yes, I was planning to set mine in housing and community development. Sorry, let's do that. Okay.

            Okay, next item.

            Yeah, thank you, Madam President. So this is a really big concern in my ward. They have been repeated power outages in the Bogun Square area just this past this month. And these outages have been going on for a few summers now. They're affecting small businesses just very recently. Google seniors, they have to be evacuated.

            I have been a communication administration and been receiving updates from every source, but this is far from being solved. So that's why I'm asking for, where is the short term solution, but more importantly, where is the long term solution here? I would like to send this to, yeah, I think public utilities and public works. Thank you. Yes, and Councillor Wilson. Yeah, thanks, members. I want to thank our colleague from Ward 5 for the collaboration on this.

            Yeah, like she said, it seems to happen every summer. It seems like it's getting worse this summer. Just driving through there and seeing traffic signals that are out, the reports online. People I know who live there who report long outages during really, really hot times a year. Councillor Burnley, I know we lost you during a meeting when the power went out.

            Yeah, it's a real thing. And it's taken a toll last night, a McGoon Square business owner told me that a power outage recently cost her business over $6,000 in lost business. So yeah, let's please get some answers, get some commitments to resolve in this from Ever Source, so it's not a recurring thing going forward.

            Okay, we'll send that to public utility public works. Next item. Item 4.7 is an order by Councillor McLaughlin that the director of economic development and the city clerk discuss with this council policies regarding outdoor seating and how the city may make it easier and less expensive for small businesses. Madam clerk, please send me on. Councillor McLaughlin and Councillor Davis.

            So this is item we have discussed several times in the past. And I am a huge fan of outdoor seating. Anybody who ever asked for an outdoor seating license in my neighborhood, I'm always in support of it. Because it livens up the neighborhood, gives you fresh air.

            And we have made progress in terms of having more outdoor seating. But we also a few years ago, you know, amended some things to expedite this and streamline it. And now I'm getting from business owners that the process is so owners that they're not even bothering to have outdoor seating, the process and the costs.

            Several businesses on East Broadway have chosen just not to do seating this year. So I just want to have a discussion about this. See what can be done to address it because especially if it's on it, like we have very wide sidewalks in East Somerville. You can have outdoor seating without taking parking spots away, without interrupting pedestrian safety. And I'd like to advocate for as much outdoor seating as possible. So I'd like to send this to public health and safety.

            Oh, well, fine, I'll do a community report first. So, thank you. Licenses and permits met for a relatively brief meeting about an hour.

            110 double poles in Somerville. And how we can work to lessen that number over time. We spoke about this previously in January, I believe. And there has been some progress.

            Why am I blanking on the word? Yeah, closed captioning. I forgot the word captioning. Closed captioning, ordinance, which in effect we were told there has not really been an effort to do so, although there was an initial emailing of businesses about the implementation of the ordinance.

            That was marked complete. We will, as I said, every six months or so come back to the issue of double polls so that we can continue to see the progress there. And both public hearings were recommended for both items that have public hearings were recommended for approval and are before you. So with that, I'd like the committee to approve this report.

Item 7.2 is a request of the mayor requesting approval of early voting dates for the September 16th, 2025 preliminary election and the November 4th, 2025 city election. Any discussion? Okay.

            We will place this item on file. Councillor Wilson. I'm happy to hear how effective this new hiring practice is proven to be. We got an update in finance, I think. It was on finance, the departmental hearing and on cutnet we talked about this. It's having success filling some vacancies that had been proving difficult to fill.

            About a year ago, this council has for better communication for the administration. I think this is a good example of all be kind and say opportunities for improvement. I wish we'd gotten this update back when the decision was made to actually pursue this as opposed to after it had already been implemented and was resulting in hiring processes. So yeah, I would love to learn about these things earlier so we're not hearing about this from staff when it's happening.

            That's someone likes my jokes for the next meeting. Madam Clerk, next item. Item 9.1 is the public communication. I apologize, Councillor Kippen. My apologies for missing this. I just wanted to make a quick note through you on the previous item 8.1, having to do the hiring process. It's my understanding that we are going to have new candidates for new police officers on the upcoming agenda.

            Typically what we would do with new hires are our practice now is they don't go to committee because of for many reasons that we've talked about So I would just ask the people please familiar out if you want to have questions totally valid. This is a new process Just you know be prepared don't be surprised when those names are on the agenda at the July 10th meeting Thank you, Councillor Next time

            Okay, we'll place this item on file. Next item. Item 10.1 is in order by Council for the new file that the director of economic development provide an update to this council on efforts to mitigate construction impacts on small businesses in the city.

            Thank you, Mr. Chair. So we've started the conversation actually a few moments ago. Let me just share a little bit background of why I'm putting this forward, why I think it's important. So a good friend of mine in Florida is a

            state representative and put a bill in place which I forwarded to our legislative liaison that creates a construction mitigation fund for small businesses when construction is happening in front of their businesses and they're adversely affected in particular, you know, we can see and have data around the effects.

            especially on their revenue for that day. And so I just got really interested in like what can we do here? And you know, I know this is my last meeting. I'm hoping that this can be sent to HCD for Monday's meeting. Councillor Struzzo, if that's possible. For discussion, because I think

            as we're hearing, especially in the midst of construction season, but also planning for future construction seasons down the road, you know, a small business that's barely surviving, right, in these economic times, has to close suddenly for two, three, four plus days because of construction, for any various reasons for construction.

            You know, there's sidewalk reconstruction happening right now, and my ward soon paving will start, you know, so it's affecting word six as well, and a lot of the paving projects that we're all really excited about. But it really affects folks's ability to get to our small businesses and it affects their ability to stay open and take business. So I just hope we can start this conversation and hear, particularly from our economic development team, you know,

            what are some of the efforts beyond just communication, which I think is the bare minimum, frankly, to our small businesses to support them during really heavy construction seasons in front of their small businesses. So that's what I'll say.

            Thank you. I'd like to send on to that Councillor Struggle. Thank you and Mr. President for you to Madam President. I agree with you. I do feel that we have to be a bit more proactive and we have to have a designated plan set in motion because yes, I'm grateful that you put this forward. I'm happy to put it on the agenda.

            And also if the business owners would be interested in speaking that night at housing and community development, I'm happy to sponsor them and keep it in committee if it is a conversation that we need to carry on for another meeting. I think it's something we absolutely have an implemented plan and are using every single time because

            Councillor Wilson? Yes, Mr. President. There's a monthly Davis Square Merchant meeting that happens and you're typically there, Councillor Burnley's been at some of those as well. At the May 1, there was just a raft of complaints from really frustrated business owners just describing the impacts that they feel from this. We heard from about a coffee shop who relies on their window for service. They showed up to work one day and their sidewalk was dug up.

            They couldn't operate. It really hits businesses hard. And there's got to be a way to better inform them of impacts or coming. And I know, we hear all the time how city contract, it's the same deal that you get with residential contractors where you might think they're going to come one day, maybe, you know, you get a range of dates sometimes, it's tough to get them to come in, but still, if we can just give them the most up-to-date info we have, I think that would help a lot. I'd made a suggestion of sharing

            Jesse Moose is weekly right away email and making sure that economic development's sending that out to business owners. So they have some idea of what's coming that next week, much like we have. I just think it's got to be, you know, I'll say, another really good opportunity to do a little better. Okay, thank you. So that'll be approved and a copy sent to Housing Community Development.

            rental apartment in Somerville as a mom of a child under the age of six has been really illuminating for me and so I wanted to bring this because I don't have any answers to this problem but I do want to raise this the council level at the city level so we have really fantastic lead laws in the state of Massachusetts that I won't bore you with the details here but that require owners and landlords to do lead mitigation if

            if someone if a family moves in and let is found. We also have really strong fair housing laws that prohibit discrimination against lots of different identities in particular family status. So you would think these two would go together. What's really interesting about the process is that

            As you all know, and I applaud the efforts to attempt to get the brokers fees out of this process, that real estate brokers are often a very key part of this puzzle, that as I'm looking at it, but I being tenant, not to the Councillor, to attend it, Judy is looking for a new apartment, I will reach out usually to a broker, because most of the apartments in Somerville are not usually listed by owners, and as the

            broker to show me the apartment. They usually respond with a bunch of questions about who's going to live in this unit and tell me a little bit more about yourself. The minute I share that I have a family or a child or the age of six, I get ghosted. Truly. I have documented evidence on the number of apartments I've reached out to and the number that get back to me and it's about a 10% return rate.

            So only 10% of the apartments I've reached out to I've seen in person that it's not my experience when I moved three years ago So I'm a renter I move often like a lot of people in Somerville. It's a pretty common experience and I did not experience this when I was

            I do not experience this when I was a single person looking at an apartment. I've only really experienced this year. And I know that the rental markets change, but I've also been in really difficult rental markets in the city of Somerville. As I've spoken both to kind brokers about this experience, they just say, you know,

            You have a two-year-old. And it's hard because we can only show you led-free apartments, which is usually new construction or things that have been gutted and renovated. And so most people don't want to deal with that. When I talk to parents, when I'm now that I've been sharing my experience with parents who also have kids around my age, they say, well, we are not moving until after the age of six because it's the nightmare. Or until we're squeezed into this one bedroom or two bedroom apartment until we're, you know,

            our hair is gray because it's so stressful or we move out right and we find a place in the suburbs or you know we find new construction or etc etc so it just seems to be there's these sort of ways in which the laws are squeezing our our parents

            tenants in particular and I think figuring out a way to communicate because if your housing laws are supposed to protect me against this, right? But I can't prove that I'm being discriminated against based on just not hearing back from brokers, which is sort of an interesting problem to solve here. And I think if we figure out a way to make sure that

            Everyone who's involved in this ecosystem, the tenants, the landlords, the brokers in particular, have a better understanding of what the laws are and also tenants how to protect ourselves. That might be a way that we can get at this. But I honestly don't have the solution here. I'm glad we have the strong laws that we do, but I do think that this is a way in which

            families in particular are being squeezed out not just because it's expensive to live here, but because there's just fewer opportunities to find apartments and fewer folks that want to rent to a family with a child under the age of six. So that's why I put this on here. Again, hoping to really start the conversation and see where it goes from there, but I think some additional communication with folks in different parts of this challenge would go a long way.

            Councillor Struzzo and then Councillor Brenley. Mr. President, thank you to Madam President. So yeah, it's, I'm really grateful that you're bringing this forward. I'm happy to take it in housing and community development and are there to be a talk

            about an equity, I can't recall, had it been housing. When we talked, no, we've, first off, if you haven't yet filed complaints with the Fair Housing Commission, and the commissioners within Somerville, please do, and I'm encouraging everyone, and I know you're a counselor, so you know these things, but also want to emphasize that, anyone that is experiencing that, they have to,

            to report it, they should absolutely report it to the Fair Housing Commission within Summerville because if we don't have the data, right, it's not happening. And every one of my experiences with, when I was on the rental market with kids is exactly the same even back then and it's not okay, it's discrimination.

            where we stand, we have to report it to MCAD, the Massachusetts Commission against discrimination, and then they take it at the state. And then in the previous governor, there was a massive, but three-year-long backlog. The current governor has enhanced staffing. I don't know what the current budget looks like. I haven't looked at it with that, but it's better.

            But we were hoping and we are hoping that we could one day have more ability to take that on within the city. And there are other communities, including Cambridge.

            that actually have the ability to address and investigate fair housing complaints within their city. We don't, because we would require a home role petition, which we can't, which is a arduous process, we all know. Not that we would be scared away from it, but it's now just a long process to get to that.

            but we do have to report it to the Fair Housing Commission and I'll stop talking because it's 1105 but happy to take it in HCD. Councillor Bradley. Thank you. Through the chair, I'll try to be brief.

            We want to applaud the Councillor for ward seven for bringing this forward. This is something that I think is really important not only because we already have these laws on the books but because we know they aren't being enforced. One of the few questions I really, one of the questions I asked during budget season two housing division specifically was

            do we do fair housing checks? When, many years ago, I was an intern at a nonprofit called the Equal Rights Center where I learned how to do fair housing checks because they're integral in the investigations of housing discrimination. And there are nonprofits in our area that do some of this work, but the fact that we as a government are not in that realm really limits our ability to

            really collect data on what we statistically know is happening in our community, which is housing discrimination on various levels. I mean, this council has talked for years about discrimination against section 8 voucher holders, which is illegal that we've talked about discrimination on racial lines, etc.

            I applaud these efforts. I really think we should build at some point toward actually having these checks so that we can know where bad actors lie, whether that is just from a lack of information, whether that is brokers intentionally not showing

            properties to certain people, or whether that is landlords looking at different tenants and telling them different information about the property. There's a lot more that I think we can do in this area. I'm curious to see where it goes legislatively, but I hope that one day we move towards staffing towards fair housing checks and so on our bill. Thank you. Thank you.

There are no further items before this councilman. I move to adjourn.
