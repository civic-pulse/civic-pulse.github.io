            All right, good evening, everyone. This is a special meeting of the City Council. I am Lance Davis presiding. I see him pronouns.

            All right. Excellent. Thank you for everyone for being here on relatively short notice. So we can get a couple of matters done while we're otherwise supposed to be on recess and dealing with all of the other things that we do within the community during during this time. I will not be pursuant to the City Council's rules. Please let it be known that the City Council silks the flag and let's to our uphold uphold our oath to the office.

            Yes, indeed. Item 7.1 is a request of the mayor requesting the appropriation of $654,019 from the salary contingency account to various police department personal services accounts to fund a collective bargaining agreement with the Sanable Police Superior Officers Association.

            Okay, thank you. I see that we have liaison hunter in the audience, as well as attorney Sir Goo to speak to this who would like to give us the rundown of what we've got before us here. Good evening, Council, through you, Council President Matt Sir Goo, Labor Council.

            Thank you. Thank you to the council. I'll just start by saying for meeting, for calling this special meeting or agreeing to meet during the recess. I know the administration and the affected unions certainly appreciate it. So thank you. So this item is to fund the cost items in the

            Samuel Police Superior Officers Association, a Memorandum of Agreement for a Successor Contract for Fiscal Years 2022 to 2024. This contract mirrors the patrol contract, the Council approved early in May of this year. It has its highlights, 2% cola in the first year and 3% colas in the second two years.
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="182.112" data-end="211.812">
            <span class="timestamp"><a href="https://somervillema.granicus.com/player/clip/2716?autoplay=1&entrytime=182" class="timestamp-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[03:02]</a></span>
            along with 2% market adjustments in each year of the contract. It also includes the civilian detail language from the police patrol contract, which now gives us kind of the second piece of the puzzle in terms of our bargaining obligations to roll out that program. We're all excited, I think, to get it in patrol, but we, of course, need to disappear as well. So we have that now. There's also a slight bump to hazardous duty and a bump to the detailed rate for sworn officers.
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="212.993" data-end="240.82">
            <span class="timestamp"><a href="https://somervillema.granicus.com/player/clip/2716?autoplay=1&entrytime=212" class="timestamp-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[03:32]</a></span>
            With that, I will, those are the highlights, and I'm happy to answer any questions that the council has. Okay, thank you. Are there any questions? Go ahead once or twice. All right. Seeing none, Council Bob moves for approval. We can lay that one on the table to take up in a vote at the end. Is that correct about a clerk?
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="241.681" data-end="265.441">
            <span class="timestamp"><a href="https://somervillema.granicus.com/player/clip/2716?autoplay=1&entrytime=241" class="timestamp-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[04:01]</a></span>
            That is correct, Mr. President. All right, very well, which please read the next item. Item 7.2 is a request of the mayor requesting the appropriation of $77,400 from the salary contingency account to the Department of Public Works school custodians salaries account to fund a memorandum of agreement with service and plays international union local three school custodians. Very well, attorney sir, good is that you as well?
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="266.099" data-end="289.859">
            <span class="timestamp"><a href="https://somervillema.granicus.com/player/clip/2716?autoplay=1&entrytime=266" class="timestamp-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[04:26]</a></span>
            Yes, thank you. Again, Council President, through you. So this is kind of a more, this is a unique contract. So in the school custodians last contract, that was for fiscal years, 23 to fiscal year 25. We included a wage re-opener provision because this group was willing to settle that contract with certain callers we negotiated while the wage study was still pending.
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="290.703" data-end="309.62">
            <span class="timestamp"><a href="https://somervillema.granicus.com/player/clip/2716?autoplay=1&entrytime=290" class="timestamp-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[04:50]</a></span>
            provided we agreed to reopen negotiations, wage negotiations once the wage study was completed. So now that the city's wage compensation study has completed, we went back to this group, shared the results with them, talked about what it revealed and came up with this memorandum of agreement.
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="309.62" data-end="333.683">
            <span class="timestamp"><a href="https://somervillema.granicus.com/player/clip/2716?autoplay=1&entrytime=309" class="timestamp-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[05:09]</a></span>
            What this essentially says with the wage study at a high level suggested was that our starting salary was competitive but there was a bit of compression with the salary scale with this group and that the top end had some more room for improvement. So there's a 2% in fiscal year 25, there's a 2% market adjustment added to all steps of the salary scale.
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="333.953" data-end="354.254">
            <span class="timestamp"><a href="https://somervillema.granicus.com/player/clip/2716?autoplay=1&entrytime=333" class="timestamp-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[05:33]</a></span>
            And then for the top step, the step 10, there's an additional 2% added to that, making for a 4% total market adjustment in fiscal year 25 for these folks. As well, structurally, we sought to adjust which study revealed as well by effective June 30th, 2025.
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="354.254" data-end="383.65">
            <span class="timestamp"><a href="https://somervillema.granicus.com/player/clip/2716?autoplay=1&entrytime=354" class="timestamp-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[05:54]</a></span>
            recalibrating the wage scale for this group. So that going forward, there's a permanent adjustment so that there are 2% steps in the scale instead of 1% steps. And that's designed to address, again, the point about compression in the scale and there perhaps being the top end of our scale being lower than some of our peers and what was calibrated for the SMEU building custodians. That was our internal comparator there. Yeah, so if there's any questions, I'm happy to answer them.

            All right, very good. Thank you. Questions on this item. On once, on twice. All right. Seeing none, Council Bob moves to approve this item. That will be laid on the table for to take up together with the other items. Now, quick, would you please, would you please read the next item?

            Item 7.3 is a request of the mayor requesting approval to pay prior year invoices totaling $375 using available funds in the human resources, professional and technical services account for arbitration services. All right. Who do we have to speak to this item? Sorry. Just trying to just trying to get off the video and then mute. Director Gil, no problem. Please just introduce yourself for the record and then you have the floor.
        </div>

            Absolutely. And Gail Director of Human Resources here at the City of Somal through the chair to the committee. This is for the services that were rendered in June of 24, but weren't sent to us until 2025. This was lost in the transition between HR and the law department. HR transferred funds to law who will now be paying these invoices going forward.
        </div>

            So, this was something that just slipped through the cracks in that transition period. Okay, thank you for the explanation. Any questions? All right. Seeing none, Councilor Hoffman, most of you will know this item. I'm seeing no discussion. Let's take a vote on this together with the two items that are laid on the table, Madame Clerk.
