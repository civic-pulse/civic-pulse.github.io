The strike is due to Republic Services' refusal to pay competitive wages and respect workers.</li>
</ul>

<li><strong>Summary of Mary and Wallace's Comments:</strong> Wallace, a regional vice president for SEIU 509, explained that public sector workers are often held "at gunpoint" because they lack the ability to strike.
