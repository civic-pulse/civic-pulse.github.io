            All right, everyone. Now, back to work. We have a few items that we're going to take out of order, but not in the sort of normal sense that we do. We're actually going to take the regular order of business first. Although we will take up with item 4.1, we will take up item 10.7 along with that out of order. Then we will take up items 10.1 and 10.4, and then back to the regular order of business.

            Yeah, that's essentially the plan. At some point, after we take up items, in that then regular order, after 7.5, we're going to take items 10.5 and 10.6 out of business as well. The reason for that are there are a number of items that require a two-thirds vote, and we will have a couple of our members who are away this evening joining us remotely so that we will have the ability to, if everyone were to vote in favor of those items, at least we have the possibility of having a two-thirds vote. Of course, if not, then no worries.

            you know, we go on. We'll then have a brief recess and we'll come back and we will finish the items in the regular order. So, I'm not quite as clean cut as usual, but we're trying to balance the reality of folks this time of year and make sure that we get the city's business done. So, would the clerk please call the next item. Item 3.1 is a small wireless facility from Crown Castle Fiber for facilities on a new poll at 10 Hawthorne Street. All right, and now declare this public hearing open. Is there anyone here to speak on the item?

I actually resided 77 in Wall Street I did take a look at the plans via email those sent to me and it does say an approximate pickup Deep problem those that we are very concerned as how approximate this can be I as an electrician myself, you know, this is a

            It's electricity. It's an unforeseen kind of situation. It's something you can't see and they can hurt you. And my experience running 2,000 app services for a brand of Dunkin' Donuts and for 14 units apartments. We want to know exact. We don't want approximate because if this impedes or imposes on our, you know.

            our private property, we would like to know because if it does, this would require an easement from the landlord and from us personally, so we want exact, not approximate, just to make sure. Okay? Thank you. Thank you. Is there anyone else here to speak on the item?

            Okay. No more hands. I declare the public hearing to be closed. Ms. Duffy, were you able to hear the concern that was? Yes. We can set up a meeting with the owner of 79 and 77 if that will help. Okay. Now click. We've had those folks in touch with each other. Councillor Wilson. I think I have the customer's information.

            We can certainly add conditions. We can also send it to committee if there's, although we probably won't have another committee meeting until September. Mr. President, that was my concern as if they're looking to this work. If we, if it's condition, that might be able to be satisfied then on its own over the summer. That's correct. We can add a condition that the folks that have a source have been meeting with the, with the neighbors to address the concerns. I need to vote on that.

            Okay, so Councillor Wilson so moves any discussion on that proposed amendment to the application? All right, seeing none, that is approved. Is that sort of that satisfactory? If we folks from every source have a meeting with you, you can get everything squared away and make sure that there's no concerns? All right, very well. So that will be approved with the condition that the utility meet with the neighbors to sort out the exact location and make sure everything is

            is acceptable. All right, very well. Thank you. Next item. Item 3.6 is a grand implication from Ebersource to install approximately five feet of conduit in Prospect Street from Manhole 23059 to a point of pickup at 86 Prospect Street. Now to clear this public hearing, open. Is there anyone here to speak on the item? I could definitely have a source. Would like to install five feet of conduit in Prospect Street to provide electric service to 86 per Prospect Street. It's going to be a 29 unit building.

            Anyone else here to speak on the item? No more hands? All right, then that public hearing is closed. Any discussion on the item? Seeing none, that is approved. Item 3.7 is a grant of location from Aversource to install approximately 17 feet of conduit in Prospect Street from Manhole 23058 to an approximate point of pickup near 110 Prospect Street. I now declare this public hearing open. Is there anyone here to speak on the item?

            I could definitely have a source would like to install 17 feet of poor conduit and prospect street. This is to enhance the system reliability in the area.

            The next item is item 4.1. A resolution by Councillors Klingon, Burnley, UN camp in Scotts, Saet and Vaz, Dreso, Wilson and Davis in support of Teamsters Local 25 in their Labor dispute with Republic Services. Can we take up item 10.7 together with this? Of course, item 10.7 is a communication of the mayor, conveying a communication to Republic Services, urging expeditious resolution to contract negotiations. Very well, Councillor McLaughlin.

            Thank you, Mr. President, and sign me on as well. Pinch it in for Councilor Klingon today. But this is the issue that's dear to my heart. Two things I want to say about this is everyone following the news understands that the local teamsters are on strike against Republican services.

            in 14 cities and Massachusetts. And this is not a union against some small town trash company. This is the second largest waste disposal unit in the country. Bill Gates is the largest shareholder of this company.

            and the CEO makes 170 times more than the average trash collector. So this is really the corporization and consolidation of wealth at the expense of workers, which is typical, but it's a not-back yard, so it's something we have to speak up about. So I'll let the teams to speak for themselves to this project win from local 25. I'd like to sponsor her to speak and just encourage everyone. I think most people already signed on to support this item.

            So good evening for the record. My name is Bridget Quinn and I'm the Legislative Director for Teamsters Joint Council, 10 New England. I just want to thank Start by thanking Councilman Galafalining-Klingon for sponsoring our resolution, of course, for the great support that we have with all the Councillors signing on. So local 25 represents 450 workers and republic services. And our members have tough demanding jobs and they provide such an important service to our communities.
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="1024.057" data-end="1039.582">

            For the past several months teams whose local 25 has been bargaining with our public services for a new contract. We have a few demands, very simple demands, highly wages, affordable and accessible health insurance and safe working conditions.
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="1040.392" data-end="1055.393">

            Republic services has repeatedly refused to bargain in good faith. And as a result, this company has caused a strike that is disrupting trash collection in 14 communities around eastern Massachusetts.
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="1055.393" data-end="1071.897">

            And it's also left small businesses, like the ones here in Somerville, scrambling for alternatives for their trash collection. And so make no mistake, this strike is completely, in totally the fault of republic services. And it's also not an isolated incident.
        </div>
        </p>

            Republic teamsters in California, Illinois and Georgia and Washington state have also been forced to strike. And now we have 2,000 teamsters on the strike line. Because again, this company refuses to pay its workers a competitive wages and respect them in the workplace.

            Republic, as we know, would be nothing without its workforce, right? It's workers. It worked hard every single day to provide service to our communities. But for far too long, this corporation has forced our members to endure unsafe working conditions and economic precarcity.

            Our members will stay on strike until they get the contract that they deserve because none of our demands are unreasonable in any way, shape, or form. We're calling on Republic Services, which is the second largest waste company in the nation, to provide the same wages and benefits that local companies like Capital Waste pay provide to our teamsters.
        </div>

            If a local company can afford it, so can Republic services. They can and should take care of our members and make sure that they go to work and save working conditions and come home at the end of the day and come provide for their families. And so I just want to close by thanking the members of the City Council here for supporting the workers you always do and we very much appreciate it every any time. Thank you for your time. Thank you. Council move off anything further?

            Any further discussion? Councillor Schrazel? I'm proud to sign on as co-sponsor of this and I want to commend Teem Sir's 25 for the hard work you're doing. We stand with you, I stand with you and I think that Republic Services had demonstrated a clear contempt for its workforce by choosing not to come to the table in bargain.

            public services in your business or residential to reach out to them and let them know that this is unacceptable and to stand with the teamsters and stand for fair wages and respect in place. So it's all I have to say with that. We're with you. Thank you.

            Thank you, Mr. President. I would like to thank Councillor Klingon and Councillor McGrathlin for putting this forward. Also, to thank the director for the director of Queen for speaking. I just want to make a highlight because for members of the public, when they say the demands are not unreasonable, I'd just say caption from the resolution.

            Like it says, these workers have been beginning in good fit for fair wages, affordable health care, safe working conditions, and adequate pay time off. Standards that reflect both the dignity of their level and the financial success of their employer.

            And Republic Services has failed to meet this reasonable demands and has refused to return to the negotiating table. Promoting team stars, local 25 to initiate a 24 on servant strike onto a fair agreement is reached. I'm telling you, this is like Republic Services. It's a greedy pigs.

            If this, I don't think that most of these issues that people are negotiating just like she said, I just want to share that for members to know that these are just basic stuff that workers need to preserve their dignity that they are not giving it to them. So thank you for indulging me. Thank you, Councillor Scott.

            Thank you, Mr. President. I can honestly say, I've never been happier to have my trash not picked up. This is, you know, I'll admit, I've had a commercial Republican Services dumpster for over a decade, but this is fundamental to workers' rights, even though it is hot out there, and it is stinky out there.

            One thing that I did want to highlight though in this is the mention that there are apparently over 100 residential and commercial customers here in Somerville, particularly as it released to the residential. I've heard from several large buildings in my district who are concerned about the heat, about smell, and about the fact that

            It's really going to be a log jam situation for them. I would like to request that the administration consider the possibility of extending some of our municipal tipping. I know it's not the city's policy. It's been not to service buildings over a certain size. But for the duration of this particular labor conflict is a way to both support our residents.

            and to support the workers who are fairly on strike here to get good working conditions. I'd like the administration to consider what we can do to facilitate residential trash pickup for these buildings that are left high and dry by Republic services right now. Thank you, Mr. President. Okay, thank you. Madam Clerk, for the council light, does that request a copy of your center of public services? So make sure it does.

            If it does not, since we have a copy of the letter that the mayor sent, if we could glue copy this as well, so that it be very clear that both branches of the city government feel strongly on this issue. Make sure that gets to the right folks. Very well, thank you. And thank you for coming here this evening to speak on it. All right. So that item is approved. Those two items are approved.

            that they are looking to assess whether this would be a good street for speed bump to just slow down a relatively small road that connects to some of our more major streets.

            Thank you, Councillor Burnley, and just for clarification for folks who are thinking this is between Highland and Summer, there were speed bumps installed on this wider section of cherry between Summer and Elm Street, right?

            Councillor Brennan. Thank you. Mr. President, through you to the clerk, I'd like for this to be the language of this resolution to be replaced with amended language that the clerk has before her.

            in for her to read out the language after we take a vote. Councillor Burnley moves to replace the item with the revised version that was sent to the clerk. Madam clerk, could you have that version? Could you get on your screen in just a moment and I will read that into the record as well.

            Whereas education, research and academic inquiry are values intimately connected to the lives, careers and passions of summer villains, and whereas the Trump administration has targeted education and research, including grants, funding and academic freedom at Harvard University, and whereas Harvard University employs many residents of summerville,

            and whereas labor unions play a critical role in workplace and economic justice and whereas Harvard University is attempting to strip union protections away from workers who are in tenuous positions in science research including by removing hundreds of students from the Harvard graduate student union.

            and be it further resolved that some of the urges Harvard Administration to seriously engage with the demands of the Harvard Graduate Students Union on issues from fair pay to protections from harassment and discrimination to resources for non-citizens and be it further resolved that a copy of this resolution be transmitted to Harvard University Administration and President. All right. That motion is before the committee any discussion on the motion to replace the item with the revised version. All right. Seeing none, that is approved. The revised version is now before us, Councillor Brennan.

            Thank you. And thanks to the clerk for reading that out. It really tells a one piece of a very troubling story that has been going on for years. And frankly, it's a story that's older than Harvard, older than this country. It's a story of labor. It's a story of the question of what a worker is.

We can get that working because we want everyone to be able to participate in all of the items included as important. We'll take a brief recess to see if we can get that operational. We'll come back as soon as it is.

            Not quite sure how soon we'll be able to get this issue addressed. My sincere apologies. We are actively working on it, but it doesn't seem like something that is likely to be fixed in the next five minutes. So we're going to continue on captioning is available. So this is effectively captioning for the room. For the Chamber itself, captioning is available for folks watching on Zoom. So hopefully they are already aware of that because they're hearing and seeing my voice through that captioning and my apologies.

So all I can give you is that we're working on it and doing our best that we can to get it back up and running. Councillor Burnley, my gratitude for your forbearance. You have the floor.

            We are seeing some incredibly disturbing and frankly disgusting actions by the largest higher education institution, not only in our great Commonwealth, but in the nation. An institution which has billions, billions of dollars, is attempting to remove 973 workers from their union.

            on the argument that they should have never been considered for the union anyway, which is an argument that the Harvard grad students union has faced since they tried to unionize initially. Many years ago, this argument that they are not workers and they are not entitled to the benefits of workers.

            Now, this is something that I view as incredibly dangerous and existential for workers of all kinds and backgrounds because it's a fight that predates Harvard, predates this nation, and gets to the heart of the fight for labor. When we define what a worker is,

            in such a way that we remove people who do the hard work to make our institutions run, to clean our facilities, to make our society function. We are allowing the degradation of the dignity of every single person

            on this planet, the degradation of all workers. This is an injury that strikes at the heart of not only unions, but of every person who gets up and goes out the door trying to provide for their families, trying to provide for themselves. When we define

            workers, as less than, and to say that they do not have the rights that all people are deserving of. We, not only the smurch, but degrade our collective dignity, and that is what Harvard is attempting to do through reliance on a besieged national labor relations board through

            the force of knowing that if they are able to remove these workers from the union, they will essentially cut out a third of their dues. They will be effectively trying to bankrupt this union. And like so many other fights, we know that this will only be the beginning.

            Hello, well first of all thank you so much Councillor Burnley for bringing this resolution and for having me here to talk a little bit about it and what this means. So my name is Dorothy Manovich. I have been a summerville resident for five years living in ward two in union square and I have throughout the course of my graduate program
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="2379.322" data-end="2402.137">

            I have been able to live a good life here because of my union and the things that my union has fought and won for me. Some of these things include being able to pay for dental surgery that I would not have been able to afford otherwise, which was reimbursed through union healthcare funds. Protections from overwork.
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="2402.137" data-end="2426.723">
            <span class="timestamp"><a href="https://somervillema.granicus.com/player/clip/2715?autoplay=1&entrytime=2402" class="timestamp-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[40:02]</a></span>
            protections from harassment and discrimination that I've benefited from in my workplace and that's, you know, just kind of like the top of the list of some of the union protections that we won as the Harvard Graduate Students Union that have made my life and my work livable here in this amazing community. And so I also wanted to highlight in addition to some of the points that Councillor Burnley has already highlighted kind of what
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="2426.723" data-end="2455.597">
            <span class="timestamp"><a href="https://somervillema.granicus.com/player/clip/2715?autoplay=1&entrytime=2426" class="timestamp-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[40:26]</a></span>
            is happening right now for the Harvard Graduate Students Union and at Harvard and what this means for us, right? So as Councillor Burnley said, Harvard University is attempting to strip union rights fully from 973 workers based on our most recent analysis and partially from an additional 1,000 workers. And this constitutes an attack on those workers specifically and out on our union in general.
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="2455.9" data-end="2473.012">
            <span class="timestamp"><a href="https://somervillema.granicus.com/player/clip/2715?autoplay=1&entrytime=2455" class="timestamp-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[40:55]</a></span>
            These workers are also concentrated in system fields, which have already been attacked by the Trump administration. These are workers who are already under extreme stress and labs that are already seeing funding cuts. They're being attacked by the Trump administration, and now they are being attacked by their own university.
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="2475.172" data-end="2502.56">
            <span class="timestamp"><a href="https://somervillema.granicus.com/player/clip/2715?autoplay=1&entrytime=2475" class="timestamp-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[41:15]</a></span>
            And not only is this just a master problem, it's also illegal. This is pretty explicitly illegal, and this is something that with a functional NLRB, we would have many more options to fight this, but because Harvard thinks they can get away with it, and because labor law and the NLRB is what it is, we are in a more difficult position than we ought to be.
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="2503.657" data-end="2532.682">

            And so, I want to highlight specifically what this means for the workers who are attempting, or however the university is attempting to cut out of our unit. So these are a thousand workers who are going to lose the wage protections that we have in our contract. Any new wage increases that we win, they, if Harvard is successful, they will not have access to those. They will not have access to the harassment and discrimination protections that are so important to us and that we are fighting to
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="2532.682" data-end="2551.514">
            <span class="timestamp"><a href="https://somervillema.granicus.com/player/clip/2715?autoplay=1&entrytime=2532" class="timestamp-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[42:12]</a></span>
            expand in our next contract. And as I'm sure a lot of you are aware, Harvard has had massive, massive scandals, especially related to gender-based and sexual harassment over the past decade, some of which were centered specifically in my department.
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="2551.514" data-end="2578.295">

            And so in addition to this, we also have funds to help people with emergencies when they lose their housing, when they have a family member who passes away or gets sick and they need to travel and have expenses that they weren't expecting. We can cover those. We have funds for healthcare and dental and childcare, which as we know is a problem not only for the parents who are in our union, but also for our community, so many parents in our community.
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="2578.295" data-end="2584.657">

            And if Harvard is successful in cutting out these workers, all of that is going to evaporate for them.
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="2585.787" data-end="2612.315">

            We also as a union rely on union dues like all of their unions do in order to fight for our workers. That means paying for lawyers. That means paying for our wonderful staff who carry a lot of the burden of our organizing and everything that comes with running a successful organization. And so with a potentially massive cut in dues,
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="2612.315" data-end="2638.927">

            We will be at a much lower capacity to operate, which Harvard has never wanted to have, has never wanted to have any unions on campus. And they fought very hard against the formation of our union. And so it is not surprising that they are seeking to weaken it in this way. And so the solution here is for Harvard to once again recognize these workers as part of our unit as they have been since our unit's inception.
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="2639.787" data-end="2666.332">

            And once again, it falls on us as a union on our union brothers and sisters and our on our community to fight shame and pressure Harvard into doing the right thing. And so we hope to get the council's support on this resolution and your partnership in this fight for the workers in our union and the workers in our community. Thank you. Okay. Thank you.

            you know for not just for you but for like the community and I used to be a member of the union when I was in grad school I was a teaching fellow and I was also a teaching assistant and I was paying my dues because I know the importance of being a member of the union so I think

            Thanks, Mr. President. Harvard versus Trump gets all the headlines, right? But this is Harvard taking advantage of the rollback under Trump of labor gains, and it's really disgusting. As the spouse is someone who I watch get just terribly exploited for five years in a PhD program by the Academy, this is just

            It's infuriating to see this. Academia is founded on the exploitation of student labor. Let's be real about that. And the best antidote is student unionization. I can't tell you how many times during those five years of grad school that I told my wife how badly they needed a union after witnessing the latest ridiculous

            I am dismayed that we have to be having this conversation right now. I think it is, somebody very wisely told me not to long ago that this is a time to de-escalate all conflict with anyone who is not actually the enemy. And we are in an environment where conflict is being escalated, where the force of the federal government is being deployed.

            at both institutions and directly at our neighbors. We've seen institutions that have buckled to that pressure, whether it would be a law firm like Paul Weiss or University like Columbia, who decided that collaboration was the better approach. But here,

            When Harvard decided to not buckle to stand up for some principles that most people would like to see them stand up for, there was not pouring support from the community. From institutions all over the country to say thank you for doing the brave thing, for doing the right thing.

            Here, the brave thing, the right thing is very obvious. And I would urge Harvard to de-escalate this conflict because your graduate students are not the enemy. Your workers are not the enemy. They are the people that make your institution flourish, the people that make your institution function, the people that make your institution great.

            And confusing your allies with your enemies is one of the simplest ways to undermine and rot out your entire organization. So I would implore Harvard, please. Let's de-escalate this conflict. Let's all stay on the same side of fighting for the values that we all share. Thank you, Mr. President. Council President, how are you doing?

            Item 10.3 is a resolution by Councillor Brenley. In support of certain public workers, right to strike. Councillor Brenley. Thank you, Mr. President. You might sense a trend in my items this evening. On the previous item, I spoke a bit about the importance of

            recognizing the dignity of workers, understanding what being a worker entitles a person to within an organization, and to that point, on this item, the fundamental power that workers have is to withhold their labor. There is, in my opinion, no more fundamental right than that as a worker.

            And frankly, as a citizen, no more fundamental right than to withhold labor and our finances from destructive institutions or programs. And yet, so many public workers who make our institutions flourish, operates from cities and towns, to state government, to federal government,

            are not given the same rights as so many workers across this nation and across our Commonwealth and in our own community.

            a sort of kind of union until recent years. But we had to do this because for the better part of the year, our school committee was refusing to negotiate with us. And this was on virtually every issue that came before them in bargaining. From expanding recess for elementary students, which wouldn't have cost the district anything to implement. To providing living wages for instructional assistance.

            We've done this wave of strikes despite the risk, despite the fact that we've faced potentially crippling fines, because right now, our employers have really no incentive to negotiate with us at all. They know that the laws on their side, they hold that over us, they feel, and as such, they feel they have the moral authority.

Number one, the division between private sector rights and public sector denial of rights is part of the original crafting of labor law in the United States. There were carve outs on various things designed to assure enough votes to get it through. Those carve outs establish, for example, the exclusion

            agricultural labor from the NORB. Why? Because they were brown skinned and they spoke Spanish and many did not have citizenship at the time. It arranged for the carve out of black workers, especially in the south where seven representatives and senators would not vote for the bill.

And it divided into private sector and public sector and public sector Heather, no right to strike in most states, state regulated. Therefore, it can be changed in this state in some ways. We're actually quite lucky under the inventing dictatorship of the New Fuhrer.

            We actually may be in a better position than some of the private unions that are going to be targets for union busting. Nonetheless, it would be a much better situation if we were increasing in power. And I speak to tonight to the last point, which is all the folks around this horseshoe are Democrats.

The way to do that is to engage the working class in this country through all its expressions, one of which is the labor movement. And that means taking some risks that some things may jeopardize the apple cart in some areas here in Somerville.

            The won't necessarily do that in the case of the teachers, the education workers, the educators union bargaining. I was astounded how cordial the last night's bargaining was when they attained a contract. On the other hand, there was the long drawn out slow torture of what was in the Summerville Municipal Employees Association.

            Had they had the right to strike, that contract would have been settled much earlier and we would not have lost nearly as many people out of that union working for the citizens of the city. There may be some conflicts that cause strain if you want a labor movement to fill the sales of the Democratic Party that all the people here belong to in one wing or the other.

            then you're going to have to take some risks. Otherwise, without a labor movement, you saw in the last election where alienated victims of a bad economy and utter inaction from either of the two parties often on labor issues cost us. That's very clear. It's a small risk and there's a big gain if you build a labor movement. Thank you.

            Good evening. I'm Mary and Wallace. I'm a resident of Board 4 and a regional vice president for SEIU 509 and sit on the private sector of, I mean the public sector side of the local which represents 13 state agencies. One of the issues on why we support this the right to strike is because we are held at

            gunpoint for lack of a better words because we have no ability to really fight for what our members and the families and clients that we represent deserve. Not all contracts are just about wages. It's about working conditions, but it's also about fighting for the people that reside in our communities.

            And we are literally held at the state, for my local, we are literally held at the state's back in call as to when they want to sit at the bargaining table. At any point, they can cancel a session.

            able to, they don't have to come with bargaining items, we have literally stall negotiations for over a year at times because they control when we meet because we have no power over them. And if all of you can remember a couple of years ago, we actually passed a contract and our money was being withheld from the state.

            They wouldn't sign the increases. It was Christmas time, and our members were going without their money that they bargained for, voted for, but it was sitting. We are held by municipalities, by state elected, all the time. And we're also held in bound. Our raises come based on income. So we are already at a disadvantage most times, then large corporations like Harvard,

            Thank you, Mr. President. It feels like it's Labor Day already. So it's always good to have these conversations before the City Council. In an honor of an early Labor Day, I would like to talk a little about the history of labor and strikes, which were not always allowed for anybody in this country. There were times when the National Guard would break up strikes in support of business owners. Business owners were allowed to lock out employees, but unions were not allowed to strike. People were killed over this.
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="3835.87" data-end="3840.258">

            and the struggle for labor continues to this day.
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="3840.663" data-end="3869.907">

            And I support, first of all, I support this. But people think going on a strike is no small thing. It's not a vacation. It's not time off. The workers take a tremendous risk doing this, a risk of not getting paid, a risk of potentially losing their jobs, being replaced by scabs or whatever you want to call it. There's a chance that things do not work out for the workers. So if a group of people decide to vote,
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="3869.907" data-end="3897.835">
            <span class="timestamp"><a href="https://somervillema.granicus.com/player/clip/2715?autoplay=1&entrytime=3869" class="timestamp-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[01:04:29]</a></span>
            in favor of a strike. That's a really big deal. And I don't want to see teachers go on strike. I don't want to see garbage workers go on strike because everybody gets hurt in that process. But they're hurt along with it as well. And they're the people who are dealing with it the most direct and just to point out to you what Jim said as well. You know, the history of this is the Democratic Party was used to be organized. Labor was the backbone of the Democratic Party.
        </div>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="3897.835" data-end="3926.354">

            Union membership has declined. The Democratic Party has declined. And then there's also instances where maybe the values aren't aligned like they used to be. So I do see this as a good opportunity to speak up in support of organized labor. People's right to strike, which again, it's a risk they are taking. It's not a fun decision. I don't think it's a decision anybody who relies on a salary would take lightly.

            So, even a public service employee, I would hope, you know, vital work being done, but people need to be paid for that vital work as well. Councillor Wilson and then Scott. And Councillor Schrazer would like to sign on as well. Yeah, thanks Mr. President. Yeah. Thank you, thank you to my colleague for bringing this forward. I appreciate the comment about, you know,

            What do you, how do you, how do you ultimately, like the power of the strike and how you ultimately settle these? It was just yesterday, there was a headline I read from the UK. It was some of the effect of labor, the labor party promised to do away with public sector strikes. Why are we seeing so many of them? And I was shocked for a second. You know, I know obviously this new labor is a little disappointing to everyone, but I thought they really abandoned public sector strikes and it turns out

            Labor's approach has been to go give good contracts to their public sector unions over there, and that's how they're avoiding public sector strikes. So it just speaks to what we heard about how the answer to, yes, give the right to public sector employees to strike, and then go do right by them and you won't have public sector strikes. Simple.

            God's just got. Thank you, Mr. President. We've talked about a lot of important pieces of organized labor and units tonight. I want to lift up one thing that Ms. Wallace touched upon, which is that the folks that are working in these public sector jobs are frequently taking lower pay.

            because they believe in an ideal of a public sector that provides services, a government that works for the people that helps our neighbors. And as politicians who sit around having large conversations about values and then try to implement policy,
        </div>

            I don't think it should be undervalued how much the people working in direct service delivery in these public sector jobs also have really strong values around the services that they are providing and the services they would like to provide.

            You know, we're talking about DCF. You're talking about people who have the best interests of these families and these children of heart and want to be able to deliver the services that their neighbors deserve, that they would like to receive if they were ever in a horrible position like that. And not having the dignity

            or even the option of the right to strike puts them much farther away from the decision-making power that they should have when it comes to shaping policy. Not just the overarching things that we might talk about around this horseshoe or might get talked about at the state house, but even in the day-to-day implementation of how people are treated. Not just the workers on the job, but the people that they're serving. So, as with just about all things,

            removing the impediments to more people being involved in those decision-making processes, removing the risk that a worker faces because even with the right to strike, a strike is a scary thing. I believe that these are absolutely essential and I think they result in a better system where all the people who are part of this incredible

            rare idea of a government that serves our neighbors should have the strongest possible voice in how those services get delivered. So I, of course, 100% support this and we'll continue to support the workers in our public sector who are trying to lift us all up together. So thank you, Mr. President. Great.

            I've never quite understood why this particular rule exists that public sector workers can't strike. And, you know, I'll confess I'm biased. My mom was a second grade teacher, special ed and second grade teacher for her whole life, her working life, and beyond her retirement, actually, and a proud union representative for her school.

            And I saw how hard she had to fight for anything, even just to get a planning period for her colleagues, which she did. She was very proud of that fact. But without the ability to strike, that was a huge win, just to get a little planning period during the day.

            I've talked with some folks who currently reside on the committee which is not effectively does not have forum yet.

            is in fairly solid shape with a total of over 13.5 million available for new commitments. The revenue into the trust has been declining because of the poor real estate market and lack of new zoning linkage. However, the trust has achieved its 13 million of available funds partly by going back and moving on spend money from past years out of several accounts of unfinished programs.

            Madam Clerk, while we're waiting, can we lay this item on the table, and I can make a few administrative notes to the council? Of course, Mr. Mayor. All right, very well. So that item we've laid on the table briefly while we get some of the department here. Members will notice in their remarks a printed copy of the council's rules. I missed this. We used to have updated copies that I always kept in my drawer. I found it useful, and so I asked that we go back to this to having this handy. Of course, the rules, this is not a complete set of the rules because we defer to Robert's rules of order.

            except for where they are superseded by this. So keep that handy if you want. It can come in really handy if you want to use procedural rules to accomplish something that they can be very useful at times. What was the other thing I was going to note?

            captionaries joining excellent that is very good news. Oh, I submitted some changes to the committee assignments to the clerk today to replace me as chair because the president does not serve as chair or vice chair. So in each case, for those two committees, the vice chair will assume the chair of those committees. When those go out, if anyone has any concerns for any reason, of course, let me know we can always adjust. Those will be

            Councillor Davis. Thank you, Mr. President. The committee did meet on July 1st. We had a discussion on a number of items. Well, it's really just two substantive items. One was a proposal to look into, I'm trying to find the item in the agenda, to look into regulation of
        </div>

            or motorized bicycles. The Boston ordinance that was referenced really has to do with insurance on those. And so the discussion was, we kind of focused more on other, that as well as other ways that we might make the community path safer, vis-a-vis motorized vehicles and the types that are out. The item was left in committee, I believe,

            Suggest regulations, and so over the course of the recess, we work with a lot of department to look for something we can do there. And then the primary discussion was on proposed amendments to the condominium conversion ordinance. I would like to, so that's item 24-1740. I would like to move to sever that item with the intent of placing it on file. The reason being that we have a separate item, which Madam Clerk, I left my notes up there,
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="10887.089" data-end="10912.216">

            Madam Clerk. Yes. Just the reference for folks, the separate item. Item 7.1. I thought so. So my suggestion will be to move to 24-1740, which is 62. No, wait, that's not right. 25-1044
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>

            which is 65 that had been recommended to be approved, but there's part of the discussion in committee was to the administration requested that we establish an October 1st effective date for these amendments. Because there was some disagreement on exactly how to do that logistically, we left that to be determined. The administration has worked with the clerk's office on proposed language, and that has reflected in item 7.1.

        </p>

            So, after the report, I will ask that we take up item 7.1, which is the replacement for this item. So, first, Madam Clerk, I'd like to request to, or Madam President, I move to sever item 25-1044 with the intent that it be placed on file. So, Councillor David moved to sever item any discussion or position. So, the item is severed.

            Mr. President, I'd like to place that item on file. By the end of the election, the item is placed on file. And I will discuss the substance, I'm happy to summarize the substance of item 7.1 separately after we get through the report. So with that, I request that the report be accepted as submitted. Any discussion? The item is approved. Thank you, Mr. President. I'd like to take up item 7.1 out of order, please, if we could.

            I don't think you read that either. Item 7.1 is a request of the mayor requesting ordainment of an amendment to section 7.64, 7.65 and 7.68 of the code of ordinances to reduce displacement of tenants and update relocation payments.

            Okay, the item first, Councillor Davis. Thank you. Okay, so just to be clear, this item is a replacement for the item that was in committee that we just placed on file. Substantively, it is exactly the same as the item that was in committee with the exception of the aforementioned October 1st effective date.

            The substantive changes are the result of a working group that met many times over the past several weeks or months. I'm looking to Councillor Scott to correct me if I'm wrong here. But the working group ultimately recommended some

            Miner changes in terms of textual, you know, in terms of the language, the intent, this was a result of requests and concerns that were brought to many Councillors that had experienced, from constituents who had experienced a building being sold and then being converted to kind of many,

            I need a loophole in the ordinance. And the request was to the administration, department of housing stability, housing department others to see if there's a way we could mitigate the impacts of that scenario. And ultimately what they came up with working with a lot of department to make sure that what we, what was recommended was on solid legal ground, what were the changes that are before you. So the substance of these is the same changes that have been before the council for many weeks now.

            discussed in committee a week and a half ago and reflected in the item that was in committee and are also reflected in item 7 that wanted to for us. Mr. President, I'd be happy to defer to the good Council for more to who served on the working group if there's more detail he cares to share about the substance of the amendment.

            Oh, I want to thank you, Madam Clerk. So I want to recognize that Councillor Ewing campaign has joined the Council remotely. Councillor Scott. Thank you, Mr. President. And thank you to my colleague from Chair of Legislative Matters, former Chair of Legislative Matters.

            This was actually an incredible working group of staff working with members of the kind of conversion board based on as reports from constituents. And the fundamental problem is that there are tenants rights that should be provided and that based on the timeline of the ordinance as it currently exists.

            It has proven to be trivially easy for tenants to be displaced from their apartments, a demo permit to be pursued. And then by the time the condo conversion process actually takes place, those tenants are long gone and unable to be found and that the waiting process, the timeline,

            is such that it lines up pretty closely with the normal permitting process that somebody would go through. So the working group went into a great deal of depth on a variety of different approaches and

            I gotta say, some of them I liked a lot, but based on defensibility, based on efficacy and frankly also on simplicity, this is a very elegant solution to quite a few of the problems, but in specific the circumvention of the intent of the ordinance. So this is a very simple change.

            will and intentionally so, inconvenience people who are attempting to not provide their tenant relocation benefits or their tenant right benefits that the council has established as a policy goal and established an ordinance through several years of work. So I want to once again reiterate the things that I gave in legislative matters committee for the people who worked on this, for the folks who brought a spirit of collaboration and exploration to the table and trying to reinforce this ordinance.

            Mr. President, if I may add just the initial detail. Thank you, through you to the good Councillor for more to thank you for that summary. One point that I thought I found interesting in the discussion as it was conveyed to the committee was that the ultimate effect or the intended effect of the proposed changes, which as I said are very

            minor in terms of the actual language are to make it more attractive to keep folks in their homes, to not clear out of building. That is truly the driving, as I understand it, that was the driving intent, really not anything else other than to

            to make it make more sense for folks who might own the properties or be buying properties to keep folks in their homes until they're ready to take other actions on it. I will note that during the meeting the administration noted that there had been some a request from some constituents to not take action this evening.

            or that evening at the evening of the committee meeting and to that end we did ultimately recommend approval but I noted very specifically that if folks did have concerns that at that point I had not heard any of those concerns directly but certainly provided us a week and a half opportunity for folks to weigh in. I have received some feedback since that time as I imagine others have as well.

            But and when we have four items that are also on the agenda, this is considered better communications regarding that. That's what I call a couple of citations to that. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Councillor Davis, and may the record reflect that Councillor Clingon has joined us remotely, but I'm clear. Yeah, Councillor Wilson.

            Yeah, thanks, Mr. President. We mentioned Counseling and Camping. He'd mentioned last week in the legislative matters meeting that there's no rush to vote on this proposal. The proposed ordinance changed tonight, given the October 1 effective date. Given that we have seven of us here in the chamber tonight, to join in us here remotely, I think it makes a lot of sense that Counselor Davis referred to the feedback about, you know,

            taking a beat just to table it for our next meeting in order to give Councillors just time to know exactly what this is and know it frontwards and backwards for good two-way communication with the public about it and to have all ten of us here for that discussion in that vote.

            I spent time earlier today watching that presentation from legislative matters last week reading the legislation, talking to our legislative and policy analyst. I personally had good place myself as a result. I support this. I think it accomplishes the stated goals with some really simple clever incentivization. I'm not going to pretend that I think that all of us are

            In that same place, I've had that same opportunity to get to that comfort level. So I think this is about the process. And I think it makes sense to just table it for the next meeting and take it up. And so I'll move to table the item. It's item 71 until our next meeting.

            There's a motion on the table on that motion, Councillor Davis. Thank you, Mr. President. On the motion, I'm comfortable with that as well as I said in the meeting that we can have a go. Certainly want to make sure folks have time to weigh in. My sense is that

            They have now, but certainly I read all the communications that came in. I would actually ask that those four items be also laid in the table so that they remain in the agenda. So we have that context, if folks want to review them over the summer. There were some concerns raised that we're not specifically discussed in the committee meeting. And I will take the opportunity over the recess to touch base with that.

            Development, other folks to just get their feedback on some of those concerns. Make sure there's, you know, find out if there may be unintended consequences that we haven't considered. You know, I want to pine under whether I think there are or not. But I did have a conversation with the staff from intergovernmental affairs today and it's the administration's position and it certainly would be my position as well that, you know, regardless of taking action on this this evening, if this motion to table fails.

            Or whether we take it up at the next meeting of the council, which would be the end of August, that that October first day would not change. So effectively the effect of these changes would not happen any later. We essentially have

            Thank you. We don't need to roll call that I will just clarify for the record that this is going to be item 7.1, as well as 9.8, 10.18, 10.19, and 10.20, all of which are public communication.

            $500,000. And that will result in significantly long-term benefits for the community. So that's happening now. It's inactivated. That's exciting. And then we also talked about more impact on small businesses and how construction plays a role in that.

            So I'd love to hear more conversations and what you're experiencing colleagues and always welcome to discuss that in committee as well. But I think that conversation has to be happening ongoing, especially with what the impacts we're having federally and with all the construction.

            Digging up of streets, et cetera, that we're all hearing about. So I ask that these minutes be submitted as or accepted as submitted. Any discussion? All right, minutes are approved. Thank you. The next item is item 7.11, a request of the mayor requesting that this City Council schedule a joint public hearing with the Summerville Redevelopment Authority, regarding updating the 90 Washington Street Demonstration Project Plan.

            Any discussion on the item? So the suggestion is this code of land use. There's an introduction. This topic was previously discussed in finance, but that was my recollection. All committees of the whole, so really wasn't a finance item. I think land use is the best spot for this. So if there's no objection, that'll be approved to the copied land use. Item 8.1 is an officer's communication from the chief of police, conveying a biennual report pursuant to section 2-6G of the code of ordinances. Any discussion?

            All right, that item is placed on file. Item 8.2 is an officer's communication from the city clerk conveying block party licenses issued. Block parties. Any discussion? Councillor Wilson. Through the president to the clerk, in the budget this year there was a line for block party supplies. Are we now able to give those out to people?

            Through the resident council, that's an excellent question and I'm happy to answer that we have dropped to the scope of work and we are sourcing vendors. So we are in the process of obtaining quotes and once a vendor is selected, we will certainly be happy to announce the coordination of that process. It is not quite there yet. We do understand that we are squarely in the middle of the block party season and we are moving as urgently as we can, but the contracting process is a lengthy one.

            Mr. President, the contracting process is definitely a lengthy one. So yeah, I appreciate that update. I was just asked about this last night, actually, by a constituent. So thanks. All right, very well. Thank you. That item is placed on file. That brings us to item 9.1. OK, answer, Brownlee.

            Oh, thank you. Through the chair, I'd like to wave the readings of items 9.1 through 9.6 as well as 10.8 through 10.16 and ask that they be approved. Any discussion on those items? Councillor Scott? Mr. President, I just wanted to call out my particular enthusiasm for the July 19th honk community concert happening on the Lincoln Park soccer field.

            I'll jump on board the PSA train and call out the September 4th or 5th community event at Davis Square. This is the second annual event being held, sponsored by the Summer World Foundation in collaboration with Davis Square merchants. It was a really fun event last year hoping to build it more this year and get everyone together out in the streets. So look forward to that. I see no discussion. Those items are approved.

            Item 9.7 is a public communication from Courtney Foster, submitting comments regarding item 25-1170 in support of the Climate Superfund bill. Item is placed on file. Item. Let's see. We're almost there. Item. 10.7 is a public communication from Margaret Saper, submitting comments regarding a ceasefire. 10.17.

            10.17 is exactly the number that it is. It's placed on the number that I have. Power is late. There's one more. 10.21. A public communication from John Angeloni submitting comments regarding Davis Square. That item is placed on fire. We'll note that I had a conversation with the Director of Engineering on the item just today. So we're working on addressing that. And that brings us to the end of the agenda for the evening. Are there any late items?

            I see no further items before this council. I believe there may be a motion to be made from the floor. Motion to be made from the floor. Yes, of course. Rather than it being a late item, we're going to do it as a motion from the floor. Okay. The president moves that this council congratulates Councillor Sayte on the birth of her child, which arrived this week. Shall I third, I believe.

            My understanding is everyone's doing well, very happy, and we look forward to having one more set of hands to help us all get our job done by the Council. Congratulations, Councilor Saeed. That item is approved. And there are no further items before this. All right, Councilor Monegolfan moves to adjourn. Thank you all.
