<h3 id="iii-continued-discussion-multifamily-design-guidelines">III. Continued Discussion: Multifamily Design Guidelines</h3>
<ul>
<li>Chair Flynn noted that the board had received written comments on the design guidelines from Ethan Frank and Gordon Moore by 5 PM on May 12th.</li>
<li><strong>Board Member Discussion and Questions:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Diego Macias</strong> inquired about the overlap between the Multifamily Design Guidelines and the Urban Design Guidelines, noting differences in formatting and subject matter organization.<ul>
<li><strong>Eric Thorkelson (CDD)</strong> explained that the documents are compatible in content but differ in focus (residential vs. citywide). The formatting difference stems from the Multifamily Guidelines being developed in-house based on prior templates (AHO, Envision Alewife), while the Citywide Guidelines were developed by a consultant team.</li>
<li><strong>Evan Spatrini (CDD)</strong> added that the AHO guidelines explicitly reference these new multifamily guidelines, but no new zoning changes explicitly reference them outside of AHO.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Ashley Tan</strong> asked if any changes to the zoning ordinance were made to explicitly point developers to this document, similar to district-specific guidelines.<ul>
<li><strong>Jeff Roberts (CDD)</strong> clarified that guidelines are not zoning and are not criteria for approval but are meant to be helpful. Article 19, which outlines the city's urban design objectives, allows the Planning Board to refer to established city guidelines during project review. He emphasized that CDD aims to be a constructive partner in development, helping developers navigate requirements like inclusionary zoning, green building, and flood resilience, and stressing the importance of urban design.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Tom Sieniewicz</strong> questioned how the guidelines would be deployed, particularly for smaller developers, and how CDD could proactively engage with those interested in creating housing. He suggested an introduction outlining available CDD resources and a process for engagement.<ul>
<li><strong>Jeff Roberts (CDD)</strong> noted increased interest from developers in understanding the new multifamily zoning and CDD's supportive role. He highlighted that CDD helps explain zoning, standards, and requirements, and makes staff available for urban design guidance.</li>
<li><strong>Eric Thorkelson (CDD)</strong> added that the guidelines encourage designers to consider project impact on existing and future contexts, promoting flexibility and early engagement with CDD.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Mary Flynn</strong> suggested a more proactive marketing strategy for the guidelines, including distributing them to smaller architectural firms, urban design firms, neighborhood groups, and libraries, and incorporating announcements in city communications.</li>
<li><strong>H. Theodore Cohen</strong> praised the user-friendliness of the guidelines but suggested more emphasis on smaller developments (e.g., 3-6 units). He recommended moving the glossary to the beginning and reducing repetition to make the 70-page document less daunting for non-professionals. He also suggested showing examples of undesirable design.</li>
<li><strong>Tom Sieniewicz</strong> advocated for a hierarchy of importance within the guidelines, foregrounding critical issues like sustainability (tree canopy, urban heat island) and quality of construction (durability of buildings). He also questioned how the guidelines could encourage innovative, "iconic" design that might not strictly conform to conventional rules, referencing "firmness, commodity, and delight" as principles of great design.</li>
<li><strong>Ashley Tan</strong> expressed concern that too many similar images might inadvertently constrain design and suggested condensing images or including examples of undesirable outcomes.</li>
<li><strong>Diego Macias</strong> suggested bridging the gap with the Urban Design Guidelines by incorporating "core values" or "principles of good multifamily design" throughout the document, similar to the Urban Design Guidelines' structure. He praised the "principles in practice" section for its visual representation of massing relative to neighborhood context.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>CDD Staff Response to Feedback:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Evan Spatrini (CDD)</strong> acknowledged the value of broader marketing and committed to discussing internal strategies for promoting the guidelines beyond just website posting, including email lists and city manager updates.</li>
<li><strong>Eric Thorkelson (CDD)</strong> agreed on the need to refine illustrations, particularly for at-grade parking, and to address minor cleanup, clarification, and redundancy issues within the text. He noted the challenge of balancing comprehensiveness with conciseness.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Follow-up:</strong> The Board requested CDD staff to reflect on the notes and clarify any questions. Staff indicated they would review the feedback and integrate changes, particularly regarding promotion and document clarity, but did not plan to present the guidelines again to the Board.</li>
</ul>
