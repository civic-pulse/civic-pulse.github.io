                <td> Hi, everyone. Thanks for letting me testify. I&#39;m Mark Eisenberg. I&#39;m a Cambridge resident and a proud member of the Organizing Committee of Doctors Council, SEIU. I&#39;ve been a PCP at Mass General Hospital for 40 years. When I started at Bunker Hill Health Center in Charlestown, I was in charge of my own practice, my own schedule. If I had a patient who was elderly or disabled or didn&#39;t speak English, I had the flexibility to schedule. an hour appointment. If I had to pick up my child from daycare, I could arrange my schedule so I could leave early if need be. Well, over time, MGH joined forces with the Brigham to become partners. Then a few years later, spent tens of millions of dollars to rebrand themselves as MGB. Now the healthcare conglomerate MGB has revenues of $22 billion, is the largest private employer in Massachusetts, and cares for over one-third of our residents. And who sits on its board of directors? Jonathan Kraft, whose claim to fame is that his father owns the New England Patriots. James Teclette, the CEO of the weapons manufacturer Lockheed Martin. Carl Martin Yeti, liquor store magnate, as well as private equity investors and hedge fund managers. These are the people deciding the future of healthcare in Massachusetts. Mass General Brigham is currently lobbying against the primary care for you bill in the legislature, which is attempting to steer more money into primary care. My colleagues in primary care are drowning. Many are retiring early, cutting back their hours, or looking for a way out. A week doesn&#39;t go by without someone asking me for help finding them a primary care doctor because their doctor has quit. I&#39;m out of luck because I can&#39;t find a doctor for my own self. A full-time primary care job at Mass General Brigham, as currently constituted, requires more than 60 hours a week of work. So instead, my colleagues are opting to be paid part-time so that they can actually have dinner with their family or go to soccer games with their children on the weekends. That&#39;s why we&#39;ve decided to form a union, to have control of our work lives so that we can deliver better care to our patients. My colleagues voted overwhelmingly, 183 to 23, to join the Doctors Council SEIU by a 7 to 1 ratio. Instead of recognizing us, Mass. Gen. Brigham, through the auspices of Littler Mendelson, the largest anti-union law firm in the country, having twice lost their appeals to the New England NLRB, has now cynically appealed our right to unionize to the national NLRB, which cannot hear cases as it lacks a quorum. The city councils of Boston and Somerville have passed resolutions asking MGB to recognize our union. I&#39;m hoping Cambridge will follow suit. Thank you.</td>

I write in support of the apex clean energy policy order. Series is a Boston based nonprofit advocacy organization working to accelerate the transition to a cleaner, more just and resilient world. We work with investors, companies, and policymakers to advance actions that reduce emissions and build a cleaner, more resilient economy, all in a way that advances justice and equity. HE APPLAUDED THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE FOR ENTERING INTO A POWER PURCHASE AGREEMENT WITH APEX CLEAN ENERGY&#39;S BOWMAN WIN PROJECT IN NORTH DAKOTA. A COMMITMENT TO PURCHASING CLEAN ENERGY WILL SUPPORT THE CITY&#39;S NET ZERO GOALS. BUT THE BOWMAN WIN PROJECT IN NORTH DAKOTA IS CREATING SIGNIFICANT RISK FOR INVESTORS and its power purchasers by refusing to use labor, unionized contractors, and to ensuring that jobs created by this project benefit people in North Dakota who were formerly employed by the fossil fuel industry sector. As noted in my report, practices for just equitable and sustainable development of clean energy, a failure to prioritize local job creation, and health and environmental safety throughout the entire process, including land acquisition, permitting, construction, operations, maintenance, and changes to policy or regulation could create a host of financial and brand risk. Local politicians and regulators in North Dakota and other jurisdictions will be loath to welcome clean energy development to a community if local stakeholders have not been engaged to ensure that project will provide deep community benefits for the local workforce and environment. LACK OF COMMUNITY SUPPORT COULD UNDERMINE THE RAPID DEPLOYMENT OF CLEAN ENERGY AT PRECISELY THE TIME WHEN THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE AND EVERY OTHER MUNICIPALITY AND BUSINESS NEEDS IT MOST. THE FAILURE TO HIRE A LOCAL TRAINED BENEFITED WORKFORCE COULD LEAD TO COSTLY DELAYS IN THE PROJECT AND REPUTATIONAL RISK everyone involved. By living up to its transition commitments, Apex Energy could unleash new opportunities, including helping shape key regulations by collaborating with local governments, communities, and unions, improving customer loyalty and brand recognition, and submit the license to operate in a community by engaging with stakeholders throughout the planning and building process. spurring employee productivity, creativity, and flexibility by ensuring good workforce conditions and equal opportunities in local hiring, and getting access to technical talent by supporting and investing in retaining BUILDING SUPPORT FOR FUTURE PROJECTS BY DEMONSTRATING A TRACK RECORD OF PURSUING PROJECTS DESIGNED TO MAXIMIZE BENEFITS AND MINIMIZE IMPACTS. WE URGE THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE TO ADOPT THE PROPOSED APEX CLEAN ENERGY RESOLUTION AND WE URGE APEX ENERGY TO RECONSIDER ITS DECISION TO USE NON-UNION</td>

                <td>Thank you. Good afternoon, members of the City Council. I want to thank you for the opportunity to speak with you today. My name is Aaron Rosenthal, and I&#39;m the Research Director for North Star Policy Action, a think tank dedicated to data-driven solutions that help working people thrive. While our organization is based in St. Paul, Minnesota, where I currently live, I want to note that I previously worked as an assistant professor of political science at Simmons University in Boston. I continue to carry a special love for the area and miss eating lunch at Cambridge&#39;s own Clover Food Lab every single day. I&#39;m here in support of policy order number 94, expressing Cambridge&#39;s disappointment with Apex Clean Energy&#39;s decision to forego the use of local union labor on the Bowman Wind Project. While the Bowman Wind Project&#39;s website currently talks up the hundreds of jobs and significant local spending that will come from the construction of the wind farm, the reality fails to match up with the rhetoric. My particular interest in this issue is motivated by a report we published seven years ago, which served as one of the first analyses of the economic impact associated with wind energy construction in the upper Midwest. finding was simple local workers do more to stimulate local economies as you might expect this is true while construction is happening when workers donate to local non-profits and send their kids to local schools but it remains true after the project is finished when workers spend their retirement and health benefits in the community to support their families buy local homes to pay local property taxes and go to local grocery stores and restaurants All told, we found that millions of dollars are lost for the local community when the construction workforce is primarily brought in from outside the area. Through this lost economic impact, hiring practices like those pursued by Apex Clean Energy undermine the future of the clean energy transition. Communities must believe that they will reap the full benefits of clean energy infrastructure that is being built in their backyards. Failing to fully engage the local workforce and economy at this stage in the clean energy transition may ultimately lead other towns and cities across the country to forego clean energy projects, creating a more dangerous future for all of us. It&#39;s difficult to overstate the importance of this moment. With clean energy infrastructure expanding rapidly nationwide, precedents set now will shape our energy future. Through policy order number 94, Cambridge can send a clear message that will echo into the future of clean energy construction. Customers expect a just transition that ensures dignity for workers and full benefits for host communities. I urge you to vote yes on policy order number 94 and tell Apex Clean Energy that their customers want better for our workers and our communities. Thank you.</td>

                <td>Hi. My name is Clifford Stargill and I am from North Dakota. I actually live in Mandan. I&#39;ve been a laborer for 17 years. um also i&#39;ve worked at i&#39;ve worked on a lot of projects i&#39;ve worked in power plants pipeline and wind turbine as well just doing regular construction for the union and i&#39;ve been apart and i&#39;ve been a part of the labor&#39;s union for quite a while doing everything they&#39;ve asked me to do so and the other thing i was going to say is that we put in the effort with the community and going to these public service meetings that we go to uh with the contractors to help our community so and we have a connection with the community that we live in so we are trying to uh maintain i guess maintain that with some of the companies that we we&#39;ve been with we work for um Where was it? Okay. As far as this goes, as far as what I was saying, some of the companies like Apex have come in our state and have made promises about hiring local workers, whether it be union or not. And some of those jobs do deserve to be, have the chance, some of the people that live in the state should have the chance to work on these projects. Instead, they hire out of the state They hire people from Texas, you know, California. And a lot of these jobs, especially when they&#39;re doing wind turbines, they have lots of carpenters, iron workers, concrete finishers, laborers, and just none of those jobs have really gone to anybody from North Dakota. They hired out of, like I said, they hired out of the state. And my question is to Apex and the companies like them, where the jobs promised that they told us that they were gonna have. And I wanna finish by thanking Mayor Simmons and the members of the city council for standing up for organized labor in basic fairness to the mass labors of Local 151 for having our backs. Companies like Apex might think it&#39;s okay to treat North Dakota as a flyover country. But if it&#39;s customers like Cambridge speak up, they&#39;ll have to listen. Please vote for policy order 94. Thank you.</td>

I&#39;ve served in the United States Air Force for six years, which brought me to North Dakota. I worked in the service industry, Applebee&#39;s. And I know that that couldn&#39;t support my family, my wife, my kids. So I had to move on to, as we call it, a big boy job. I had my first opportunity with the union working in coal plants like most I was. members of North Dakota. I started in 2007. Once I was done with that project right there in the coal plant, I moved on to the wind tower. I worked wind towers for five years for the rest of my career in the construction industry. Also, I&#39;m still in the construction industry. It&#39;s just right now I&#39;m a rep. talking about and trying to get our local members out to work. With all the wind towers that&#39;s going on in North Dakota right now, you should have thousands of stories like this, how they became where they was at and where they are right now with the great benefits and wages. With the apex that came to Bowman when And I have sat there, testified on behalf of the local workers for the local jobs here. They talked about 300 construction jobs. Made it seem like these all could go to local workers. I am the person that boots on the ground. I go out there. I talk to the workers. I see where they&#39;re from. And just to know if they ever did wind tunnel before. We was trained to do this type of work. We&#39;ve done... CLEAN ENERGY FOR MANY, MANY DECADES. IF COAL DOES HAPPEN TO GO AWAY, WELL, WE WANT TO SAY THAT WE WANT TO CONTINUE WORKING IN NORTH DAKOTA. NORTH DAKOTA WORKERS HERE HAVE THE RIGHT FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK ON THESE PROJECTS RIGHT HERE. APEX HAD PROMISED ON THE STAND THAT THEY&#39;LL USE LOCAL WORKERS. I STILL DON&#39;T SEE THAT YET. So that&#39;s why I&#39;m coming to you on this right here. We had dozens of skilled workers that can do these projects right here. And just because they say that they hired a local contractor doesn&#39;t mean that they are hiring local workers for this project right here. So of course I come to you today to please vote on policy order 94. Again, I want to thank you, Local 151, Labors 151, for having our support, for having our back right there. Ms. Mayor and the City Council, thank you very much for your time. Thank you.</td>

Where is the city&#39;s expert in defending municipalities against RELUPA claims? apparently nowhere for the city of Cambridge. The firm that Cambridge hired to support them in this effort, while a reputable firm, has strong experience in discrimination, but in employment law, not RELUPA. The residents of the city of Cambridge are without experienced legal representation in a very specific area of law. So the residents do feel that the city solicitor has invited the fox to guard the hen house. The residents feel unrepresented and unnecessarily left in harm&#39;s way. I implore the City Council to get better information regarding the possibilities via the case law of how Rallupa has been decided in many cases in favor of the municipality as they continue in this negotiation. The city has so much more latitude than has been represented by the city solicitor. These decisions have a serious impact on the lives of the residents of Cambridge. Thank you.</td>

                <td>Thank you. I&#39;m Tina Alou and I live at 113 and a half Pleasant Street. I&#39;m testifying tonight as the director of CEOC on policy order number three regarding possible amendments to the community benefits ordinance. CEOC was fortunate enough to participate in one of the four partnerships in the last round of community benefits funding along with De Novo in transition. This partnership was critical especially during the pandemic but allowing benefits funding to be used for capital expenses would also be an incredible support to agencies like CEOC. For us having the resources to be able to renovate our building in the outdoor space would make such a difference for people utilizing our services. Tonight I&#39;m speaking about CEOC but I&#39;m sure that other nonprofits would report similar issues. First, our building is not accessible, which can be very challenging for our older participants and for persons with disabilities. Although we often go to people&#39;s apartments and homes to provide services, rather than having them come to us, it&#39;s a challenge. Second, our food pantry space is small and right on the street. We have still managed to change to a shopping model to allow to choose there, but it&#39;s not the most comfortable process in such a small space. As an architect over our space constantly, We are trying to run a grocery store out of a one-story, one-car garage. And any of you who have walked by our building on Wednesdays have seen a line of people down Inman Street waiting to be served. Coming to a pantry is hard enough, but waiting outside is cars and residents. constantly pass by on such a busy street is even more difficult we&#39;ve worked hard to reduce the wait time have set up tents with chairs on the side of our building and starting this wednesday we&#39;ll be offering tai chi classes in our backyard for pantry patrons to participate in while they&#39;re waiting but that&#39;s what we would want it to be especially as we expect the number of people coming to the pantry to increase even more Often people who visit us for the first time are shocked at how many services are offered in such a small space. We&#39;re proud of that. But our vision is to have a space to hold workshops and for the community to meet. We want people to not have to struggle to climb our stairs and stand up side by side in a cramped waiting room. We want them to have a space that they deserve. In closing, having community benefits funding to add to the support that&#39;s available from the Cambridge Redevelopment Authority, with the COC and many other nonprofits in achieving our goals. I ask you all to support this policy order to encourage the city to review the ordinance and draft amendments which could make this happen. Thank you for your time.</td>

                <td> Good evening, Daniel Liss, 1 Earhart Street. Before I worked for the city, I had the honor of serving on the Community Benefits Advisory Committee. I&#39;m very proud of the work we did coming up with a new model of distributing community benefits funds based on the objective results of a comprehensive community needs assessment to try to tackle the city&#39;s problems strategically. As for this policy order, I&#39;m very open to the idea that using the funds for capital funding instead of programming may be the best thing for the community, but ultimately it doesn&#39;t matter if there is no money in the community benefits fund. If we&#39;re going to use the traditional model of having non-profits that get the ear of a city councilor have all the funding designated for them rather than giving a fair shot through the committee to nonprofits citywide, then whether it&#39;s operating funding or capital funding doesn&#39;t matter because there is no funding to be distributed. Thank you.</td>

We have been working for years to achieve a just energy transition in both Minnesota and North Dakota and with our international union across the country. This issue of making sure that local workers see the benefits that workers who&#39;ve been maintaining coal plants and keeping the lights on for generations have their chance to work on a wind farm or a solar farm is critical to the success of that transition and we appreciate the points that have been made by north star policy by series and others both in comments and in the record here i want to make clear to members of the city council that our organization made every effort to make this a better project for local workers we participated in the original site permit hearing which took place in 2021 We provided evidence at that time that use of local workforce was feasible in that area and critical to maximizing the benefits of the project for the local communities and support for the energy transition. We offered APEX that we could provide skilled workforce to their general contractor to work on the project. but they were apparently uninterested in that. And the sad reality based on what our staff have seen on the ground is an estimate of less than 5% of all the workforce coming from North Dakota, despite the presence of lots of skilled workers who could have done much of this work. and in fact a majority of the workers coming from Texas and just like our brothers and sisters in Massachusetts would be frustrated if work that they do and could do to support their families locally was being done by workers who came mostly from Texas and all over the country folks in North Dakota feel the same way it&#39;s turning them off the energy transition and that&#39;s something that if we care about climate not only workers should be important to us so We urge the council to support policy order number 94, and I want to thank, in particular, Lionel&#39;s New England region, the Massachusetts Labor District Council and Local 151, among others, for this amazing example of cross-country solidarity. We&#39;ve been tracking this issue for many years, and this might be the first case where a customer is really standing up to send a message to industry, and we have union workers from across the country standing up together to make sure that people are taken care of. Thank you.</td>

                <td>Great. Well, good evening and thank you for the opportunity to comment on apex wind project resolution my name is lucas franco i live at 4128 22nd avenue south in minneapolis and i&#39;m the research manager for leuna minnesota and north dakota and has been been mentioned we&#39;re a construction union of 14 000 members and our members across both states build and maintain critical and energy infrastructure we have many members that live in and around the bowman wind farm project in north dakota And as has been mentioned, many of these folks have worked in the conventional energy space for decades, have multi-generational coal workers and have earned really good family sustaining wages working on these projects and are eager for new energy projects and the job opportunities that come with them. Unfortunately, I&#39;m here to share concerns with the Bowman Wind Project and encourage support for policy order number 94, uh to make sure that apex follows through on their commitments to hire good create good jobs and hire local workers this project is failing to put local workers to work including many of our members and it doesn&#39;t have to be this way it&#39;s very much a choice by the developer we&#39;ve seen far too many renewable energy projects like this rely primarily on traveling construction crews And when this happens, local workers and local businesses miss out on benefits that should be realized. And frankly, there&#39;s no excuse to primarily rely on traveling workers. We absolutely have a sufficient pool of folks on the bench eager for work. As you heard from Clifton and Steve previously, it&#39;s completely up to the developer whether or not they prioritize local workers. And as you&#39;ve heard from North Star, Economic impacts are very clear. Local workers spend three to four times more locally creating positive ripple effects for area grocery stores, restaurants, car dealerships, et cetera. Apex&#39;s failure not only hurts local workers such as our members, But it also importantly undermines the credibility of clean energy projects in places like North Dakota where communities are losing out on high paying conventional energy jobs. Their failure to follow through on promises to create local jobs creates backlash to the entire industry, which is which undermines vital efforts being made to tackle climate change and that&#39;s a huge concern for us as well. And while Apex might not listen to our complaints, they will listen when their customers demand that they do the right thing. And we greatly appreciate support and bringing forward policy order number 94 to encourage them to do just that. So thank you so much for bringing this forward and for the chance to comment this evening.</td>

I want to thank the City Council and Ordinance Committee for hearing us out earlier and we hope that The full city council will vote the amendment this evening. I just want to say that our volunteer East Cambridge committee and the people we work with closely at the Linwood neighborhood immediately adjacent work very hard to develop a plan that is responsive to good design and great advantage to the neighborhood, particularly for the East End House and other services in the area that we desperately need help on. This is a responsible and serious proposal that we hope that you will continue to support. We believe that the community benefits that attend this particular proposal will help East Cambridge become a much safer, better, and more supportive neighborhood than we&#39;ve been able to accomplish on our own.

And naturally, being Harvard, they had a panel discussion on health care. And they had a speaker. One of the speakers was a professor at the Harvard School of Public Health. And she told a story about Mass General. It was the head of the biggest hospital in Toronto was visiting Mass General, and she, I think, or somebody asked him, what was the thing that impressed him most about Mass General? And he said, their billing department. You have 150 people in your billing department at Mass General, and at our Toronto hospital, we have four, and three of them are there to take care of Americans. Maybe there could be some cost efficiencies there. On Lubavitch Inc., evidently the neighborhood bully. over on Bank Street, it&#39;s quite bizarre that a settlement that has not yet been explained fully to the public, and as far as I know, well, maybe the city council will have a better idea, but it hasn&#39;t been disclosed to the public, a settlement of a half a million dollars for something that over time kept growing and growing to the point where the people who live in the neighborhood uh, must wonder whether the city council and the city administration are doing anything to defend their interests. Maybe that half a million should be given to people in the neighborhood so they can get some, uh, representation. Um, I hope city counselors will, uh, interrogate exactly what, what exactly is the nature of this settlement. Um, at the BZA, uh, hearing, uh, David, I never seen a move through anything quite so quickly and people were just allowed one minute and there was no interest at all in what anybody had to say, most of the people were actually from the neighborhood. The last thing I want to say is on the bridge crossing the the fitchburg rail crossing when I saw the words robust engagement. I felt like maybe that&#39;s the scariest words you can ever hear from the city administration. If it&#39;s anything like what happened at Linear Park, you know, it&#39;s something to be wary of. They had the Cambridge Housing Authority had 30 emails for people who had been displaced from Jefferson Park. They never sent them notices. The people running it solicited support letters from everybody but Brickworks. And I just think it could be much better.</td>

                <td>Mrs. Mayor, City Council, Paul Goodrich, I represent the 1,300 members of Labor&#39;s Local 151 here in Cambridge. And I just want to start out by saying thank you. Why would you guys care about a project that far away about workers that don&#39;t live in this area? I just want to say thank you. And the mayor knows how I feel about this. You guys have passed some of the most progressive legislation across the country, right? That prevailing rate legislation on city street cuts matters. You guys have lifted men and women that work for utilities out of poverty, gotten them out of public assistance, off of MassHealth, employer paid benefits, employer paid You guys have done that. You have lifted people up with your legislation. And we&#39;re asking you to do it now. The fact that you have some developers say, Cambridge, we&#39;re going to do the right thing with this money. We got it. We understand it. And we&#39;re 1,000, 1,500 miles away is crap. I am sick and tired of developers coming into areas thinking that they can do whatever the hell they want. And I just want to applaud you guys, and thank you so much, because there&#39;s workers up in vans, living in the middle of these prairies, working on these wind farms with no voice. Nobody&#39;s helping them, no one gives a shit. Excuse my language, Mayor. You guys are actually taking a stand. And again, it&#39;s in North Dakota, and its place is far away, but you guys have the ability. With these tax credits, to be able to say no to bad developers that do not care about workers, family supporting wages, benefits, some type of path to retirement. I just want to applaud you for it. I know it&#39;s hot. I know it&#39;s a long night. And thank you for sticking up for the men and women that are up there asking, does anyone care about us? So I just want to say thank you. That&#39;s my time. Thank you.</td>

I help run our union&#39;s responsible investment program. The Laborers Union has over 100 benefit funds with about $72 billion in assets under management. We&#39;re also investors in Aries, the company that owns Apex Clean Energy, one of the portfolio companies. So we also have skin in the game, much like the city of Cambridge. I&#39;m here to thank you, Mayor Simmons, and the whole entire council for sticking up for working people, not just here in Cambridge, but as Paul said, everywhere, North Dakota, Minnesota. I&#39;m proud to be here to say that Cambridge demands fair pay and fair treatment for workers, whether they&#39;re working here in the city or for one of its contractors or a project in North Dakota and Minnesota. It&#39;s amazing really how much that means to our members who are helping to build those projects in North Dakota and the members here in Massachusetts. When the mayor found out that the city of Cambridge is helping to pay for a wind project in North Dakota where workers are being treated unfairly, she could have thrown up her hands and said, it&#39;s not the city&#39;s responsibility. But instead, she&#39;s asking the city and the city council to publicly hold Apex Clean Energy accountable. It&#39;s a really moving and really important thing to do. Apex is building a wind farm in North Dakota, and Cambridge is helping to pay for that. And like I said, instead, Apex has decided to bring in workers from places like Texas that leave local workers high and dry. We&#39;re really proud to help support the policy agenda, and we want to thank you once again for listening and for being here for workers. Thank you.</td>

I&#39;m a longtime member of LIUNA Local 230, and I&#39;m here, like many others, to talk about Policy Order 94. Apex Clean Energy is leaving our brothers and sisters in North Dakota out in the cold, and it is not fair. In LIUNA, we say that an injury to one is an injury to all, and right now, you have LIUNA members who are losing out on job opportunities because Apex thought they could get away with outsourcing work to workers who are coming from thousands of miles away. The issue is simple. If a company brought a bunch of people from Texas here to do my job, I&#39;d be disappointed about it. If switching to clean energy meant me not being able to feed my family because a company won&#39;t hire local, I&#39;d be against it. Right now in Congress, we&#39;re in danger of losing tax credits that are creating thousands of jobs for union laborers, and why would North Dakota workers want their representatives to save the credits if local workers can&#39;t even get their projects? IF YOU CARE ABOUT ORGANIZED LABOR, YOU SHOULD VOTE FOR POLICY ORDER 94. IF YOU CARE ABOUT STOPPING CLIMATE CHANGE, YOU SHOULD ALSO VOTE FOR POLICY ORDER 94. THANK YOU MAYOR SIMMONS AND ALL THE COUNSELORS FOR SUPPORTING THIS RESOLUTION, FOR DOING YOUR PART FOR WORKERS AND FOR THE CLIMATE.</td>

I&#39;d also just like to thank the Cambridge locals in attendance today for your patience and attention as a bunch of North Dakotans attend your meeting today. My name is Ashley Gashk. I live in Bismarck, North Dakota at 912 East Turnpike Avenue. For the last 10 years, I&#39;ve been a public school teacher teaching eighth graders in Mandan, North Dakota. and I am currently president of the North Dakota AFL-CIO. On a personal note, my father worked construction until his retirement in 2023. And my family was very lucky that there were plenty of local jobs. He very rarely had to travel. And although the hours were long, especially in the summer, his work paid off. He wasn&#39;t just able to pay for me to take violin lessons and oboe lessons and private voice lessons, but he was also able to go to almost all of my concerts. As an advocate now for working people, I can say that the AFL-CIO supports climate action, but we also know that we won&#39;t achieve progress if our conventional energy workforce is left behind. The conventional energy economy has provided many family supporting union jobs for generations here in North Dakota. I mean, really, energy is one of our... biggest industries. And as a teacher, I attended more than one professional development seminar that was sponsored by the coal and gas industries. And they taught us about geology, which was really interesting, but we also learned about the promising job outlook that these industries held for our students. Honestly, a lot of our teachers, I think we&#39;re considering career changes when we heard what some of these workers were making per hour. Now, I went to a small college in Minnesota that had multiple wind turbines on campus. I&#39;ve been all in on clean energy for a long time. So I was really excited to see investments in wind energy here in North Dakota. And we wanna make sure that jobs in the clean energy economy are just as good and as available to North Dakotans as the conventional energy jobs we have now. However, the actions of companies like Apex undermine local support for the transition to clean energy when they bypass North Dakotans and import their workforce from other parts of the country. I really hope that my former students will have the opportunity to stay here in North Dakota and support their family and have good wages and benefits, whether they choose to go to college or into a skilled trade. And so when the city of Cambridge and other companies of these projects demand that their developers prioritize creating good local jobs, it helps ensure that our young people will have the opportunity to pursue a career in clean energy in their home states. I appreciate your commitment to clean energy investment in my home state and your public service. And I hope that you&#39;ll support policy order 94.</td>

                <td>Hello, Heather Hoffman, 213 Hurley Street. I never would have guessed that this would be the top topic today, support the unions. I&#39;d like to talk a little bit about RLUPA. I was horrified at that same meeting that a prior speaker talked about when the city solicitor said that a statute passed by Congress could overrule a constitutional provision, specifically in this case, the establishment clause. And I strongly agree with the previous speaker that the city has not received good legal counsel on this. You should insist that you get much better information about what the state of the law is, including the establishment clause, which is still part of the first amendment to the constitution. no matter how much people want to wish it away. So please do something about that because there are also people out there to sue you over the establishment clause. Now, quick one with respect to feeding kids. Yay, I look forward to seeing this every year with sadness that it&#39;s necessary, but thrilled that Cambridge keeps doing it. With respect to short-term rentals, I keep wondering how the city intends to enforce any of this. I hear stories year after year from people who talk about the apparently illegal short-term rentals in their neighborhoods, but I don&#39;t see the city doing anything about it. And it may be that I&#39;m just not seeing what&#39;s happening, but I&#39;d love to hear something about how the city actually enforces this. With respect to extreme heat, I would be remiss if I didn&#39;t note that the reason that my house is not an inferno is the incredible street tree that I can see from where I&#39;m sitting through the window. Trees make a tremendous difference, and yet no matter what the city says, their actions TEND TO SHOW EXTREME HOSTILITY TO TREES. THEY MAKE THINGS BETTER. AND WE REALLY, REALLY SHOULD THINK ABOUT OUR FIRST CHOICE BEING CUT DOWN TREES. AND FINALLY WITH RESPECT TO COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT, I KNOW THAT IT CAN BE DONE WELL. IF PERSONALLY ASKED A QUESTION UNDER OTHER THAN THE CURRENT that actually changed what the city was going to do for the better. So how about more of that? Thank you.</td>

I&#39;m going to say at least 15 years, and it may be longer than that. The Housing Authority has given us funding for one of the positions. We do not treat that position any differently than the other two positions. The majority of clients served by the Cambridge Employment Program. Our low income live in some form of subsidized housing. A few of them are unhoused. And so this position, all three of our positions are filled. This is just the annual appropriation of the funding for the position. So we don&#39;t fund a position specifically to serve Housing Authority residents. However, we serve a large portion of Housing Authority residents, and the work that&#39;s being done is helping people prepare for job interviews, think about what&#39;s the pathway that they&#39;re interested in. We have lots of clients who come to us, get support to find a job, but that isn&#39;t really the job that they are looking for over the long haul. And so they&#39;re always welcome to return back and our staff will work with them on what&#39;s the next step for you. Council Wilson.</td>

SO IT HAS EXPANDED GREATLY IN THAT TIME, BUT I BELIEVE THE PROGRAM was operational back then. The 45 meal sites include meals programs at every one of the schools where there either are summer camps or summer school programs. So there are breakfast and lunch offered every day at all of those sites. In addition, many of our community summer camps are also eligible to have food delivered to their sites and it&#39;s a little bit complicated because as you know in the summer many of the programs will go to the beach or go to some other site for a day so it&#39;s a rather complicated program to run because if you are going somewhere for the day you want to make sure you have your lunch delivered early in the morning so that you can take it with you. In addition to that, we operate the program out of nine parks. And so in those parks, the summer food program is operated there and any young person, no identification is required. And in addition to that, in the summer evenings at all of the summer basketball leagues that are operational, we also offer dinners at those sites. And the dinners, again, are available to any young person. You do not have to be participating in the basketball league. And in addition, new this summer, we will be operating something called Fun Under the Sun, which will be every Monday and Wednesday in July, starting on July 7th, in a different park. Right after lunch is served in that park, the staff of our recreation program will run different games kickball soccer basketball so it&#39;s both an opportunity to learn field games so it&#39;s an opportunity to learn but also to bring out more young people to the parks council wilson fantastic thank you so much i again just i know that this program is really um</td>

We&#39;ve talked about this bridge and this connection and continuing connections across the city for many, many years. I think it predates certainly me on council because we have some funds set aside from some of the development already at Alewife, I believe, for this bridge as well. There&#39;s easements in place. There&#39;s just so much work that has been done. And as the mayor, even reading the description, describes, it&#39;s expected to do a lot in terms of connectivity. My question is what is the timeline of the study and the scope and what will the process look like and how does this connect with the other funds that we have received for a bridge across this? I know that HealthBeak has been working on various iterations of this. I&#39;m just curious about how far along this gets us to having this, whatever form it takes in place for this really important part of the city because it is where development is poised to happen, is already happening, and will continue to happen in a way that will reshape the city in hopefully very positive ways, and this is a critical piece of that infrastructure.</td>

And once we complete that, we need to finish up some paperwork with the MassDOT agency. And then the actual design process, we think, will take about 18 months to two years to complete. And that includes a full engagement process with the community, as Brooke mentioned, permitting, for engineering and environment, and then it&#39;s going to involve many steps with MassDOT2, getting them to review and approve our various stages as we complete the design. And after that kind of two-year period, as we get near the end of it and we have a better estimate for the construction of the project, we&#39;ll be looking for design funding, most likely on the the tip also from the Boston Metropolitan Planning Agency. So that would be, you know, state and or federal funds, plus any grants that we see that might be available if inappropriate.</td>

Through you on that last point to Mr. Dinan or to the city manager, this is a design study and the funding is to do the outreach and planning. Have we any idea or... identified any source to pay for it once it&#39;s done. And I was curious, I think the last time I heard somebody throw a number around, this was maybe a $15 to $20 million project. Am I correct on that? And also, if anybody has an idea where the funding&#39;s coming from. Thank you.</td>

We are hopeful that following the preliminary injunction, as we allow our subrecipients, the entities we&#39;re contracting with, to to spend the money and we&#39;re allowed to draw it down from the federal government but how long we will be able to do that is something we don&#39;t know yet we believe we will be able to do it for the first three months but we&#39;re uncertain what will happen after that solicitor nothing further to add thank you</td>

It just makes it easier for me. These agenda items are just so important, and I think this vote is important so that we can start, I won&#39;t say deployed, but spending down those funds because it&#39;s steps in securing and deploying those federal resources, shaky as they are, that directly support Cambridge&#39;s affordable housing development and homeless services. The funds, as you know, are going to reflect both the city&#39;s ongoing commitment to responsible responsibly managing federal dollars even if they&#39;re precarious and the success we&#39;ve had in completing the new grant awards to strengthen local programs and i just want to say miss seminar because i know a lot of this falls under your the umbrella of dhsp the grant the grant writing that has been still is vigorous and ongoing so that we can continue to fund the needed resources you know we always talk about housing not being a privilege it&#39;s a it&#39;s a right and it&#39;s that work so to the folks that do this work please on behalf of the council please acknowledge that we really do appreciate this and although this is a procedural these appropriations enable our housing and human services teams to continue critical Delivering critical support to residents facing housing instability and homelessness. So I suspect that the council will approve these items promptly, and we might even want us to move reconsideration so we don&#39;t have any pause at all in the deployment of these funds. Ms. Seminoff, you wanted to add?</td>

We had folks from various organizations as well as a diversity age group LOCATION THROUGHOUT THE CITY AND ALL OF THAT. SO WE LEARNED A LOT FROM THEM OVER THE COURSE OF TIME. WE HAD THREE DIFFERENT MEETINGS WITH THEM TO LEARN ABOUT AND GET BACKGROUND FROM THEM. AND THEN WE POSTED FOR THE COMMISSION ITSELF ONCE WE HAD A BETTER SENSE OF THAT AND COULD BEGIN TO DETAIL WHAT THIS WORK MIGHT BE AND THE SUPPORT OF THE WORK THAT WE NEED IN ORDER TO MAKE THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS.

So it&#39;s our full intention, and I do want to acknowledge my colleague, Council Wilson, who came to the to the council this term and hit the ground running with trying to make sure that we move this forward as expeditiously as possible. So your concern is clearly our concern because it did take us a long time. And if you will indulge me, council, and my colleague, Council Wilson will indulge me. Let me just say a few things that might be helpful. First of all, I have to start by acknowledging Saskia Van Janes because she really, let&#39;s talk about something being a grassroot effort that she was very committed to making sure that happened. She is clearly an encyclopedic when it comes to this issue. She has so much knowledge. So I just want to acknowledge her. She had the vision and the dedication, as Director Brown would attest to, years ago when she first brought the concept of the American Freedmen&#39;s Commission to our attention. And her leadership has really paved the way for this policy order that I introduced with Counselor Zondervan, Quentin Zondervan, as Director Brown suggested. Now Director Brown, I think this preceded her in some ways, so she comes onto the job with this already in play. And a couple of things that we were able to do. First of all, we said it would be really important that we got the benefit of people who had already done this work. So we literally put together a group of individuals.</td>

                <td> Thank you so much. A stakeholder group, people who had done this work before in other cities and towns and say, this is what we&#39;re trying to do, this is what you&#39;ve done, help guide our feet on this item, and which they did. So yes, it has taken longer than we had hoped, but we wanted to be as close to being right on this, because it was so important. So I say that to say, so we&#39;re not at the executive director yet, but we thought it was important to get the commission on board. And then move to the next step, which would be the executive director. And then of course they start doing this work. Now let me just say this. The commission faces a deeply complex and challenging task. We&#39;re not talking about reparations. Can I say that again for the people in the back? We&#39;re not talking about reparations. We&#39;re talking about something that&#39;s a little bit different. That&#39;s what makes this work so important that we do it right. Because we&#39;re not trying to do something that other cities and towns have done. And there have been lots of cities and towns that have done work around reparations. This is a little bit different. The selection process of the commission that&#39;s before us now is very crucial to their moving the work forward. They&#39;re almost in some ways, and correct me if I&#39;m wrong, Director Brown, we&#39;re learning while doing. The commission, like I said, faces a deeply complex and challenging task. Other committees have launched similar efforts only to become mired in controversy. or analysis paralysis. And we must learn from those experiences, and that&#39;s what the stakeholder group was brought to do. And we met for months during the winter, the fall, and the summer, because we wanted to get as close to perfect, correct, I won&#39;t say perfect, but to get it as correct as possible. And I know folks are eager to have this work commence and get toward the finish line, but we did not get into the state that we need this commission yesterday. We&#39;re not going to get to the answer tomorrow. So we do certainly have to be thoughtful, patient, and thoughtful and patient is enough to say to make sure that We move correctly, not so much quickly, but correctly. And so this is going to take time and necessary care to make sure we do it right. It&#39;s important to acknowledge we live in a different, from the time that this commission was voted and now, it&#39;s a very different time. The federal government, the administration is working overtime against us. What I&#39;m so happy is that we live in a city and town that says this is important to us and we&#39;re going to move it forward. I can&#39;t be more proud to be with a city council and an administration that says this is important, we&#39;re going to do it however long it takes. Bearing in mind that this work, like I said, when we first started, wasn&#39;t an issue. Context does really matter now. It&#39;s imperative that we begin earnestly in stride to keep external distractions from impeding the commission&#39;s work. Our goal is to develop a clear, practical roadmap grounded in history and reality, one that advances justice for the descendants of African-American freedmen in Cambridge. I cannot say again, this will not be easy work, but it&#39;s necessary. I think, Counselor, I think we have a full nine zero votes to support the work. and we&#39;re ready to continue to further it. But I just wanted to say that to set a little context for you. I do want to acknowledge the city manager, because even the city manager can often appoint someone, and take a back seat he was very engaged probably sometimes he didn&#39;t want to be engaged because i could be cranky but nicely cranky uh but this work is just so important but i wanted to just put that lay that out for you uh counselor to give you a little bit more background i want to turn it back over to director brown but so there&#39;s any fault you want to blame anybody for us going slow you blame me and i&#39;ll even i&#39;ll take a hit for well not a hit but i&#39;ll take the flack but But again, it&#39;s because we really want to do this work. We&#39;re talking about trying to undo the harms of several hundreds of years. And although people in Massachusetts often want to say, oh, we weren&#39;t involved and try to diminish their role, we&#39;re looking it straight in the face, addressing it, say it&#39;s a reality, and saying, now we&#39;re going to stand up and do what we can to fix it. Director Brown, Mr. City Manager?</td>

So I find that interesting as a historian. I do think it is a very complicated issue. because it&#39;s hard to know what the criteria are for who was an American freedman, but I understand your point that this isn&#39;t about reparations. I&#39;m very aware, I feel as though, and we had this conversation during the budget hearings, I feel as though diversity, equity, inclusion are actually part of the Cambridge ethos and really our DNA. It&#39;s like in everything we do. So, and I feel as though our programs, we do so much. I was looking at what Evanston, Illinois, which had a reparations program that was worth 10 million, did, and they did stuff we do already. They helped to fund housing assistance programs, mortgage assistance programs, home repair programs. We&#39;re already doing that, so it&#39;ll be interesting to see where this commission takes this when we&#39;re doing so much already. So I look forward to observing the work of this group. Thank you and I yield.</td>

                <td> Thank you very much, Madam Mayor, and through you. Not much more to add based on what you mentioned, but I did want to just say, just the saying that folks may know, I think in terms of just our timeline, is that haste makes waste, and that slow and steady wins the race. And so I&#39;m really just convinced that the timing that it took us to kind of get to where we are today was important, that we wanted to be mindful of that this is a new time, Commission and recognizing that across the nation there have been other commissions or task force, if you would, or what have you, that have been established that may have been dissolved or has a lot of conflict because folks can&#39;t maybe get along. So we want to recognize that these group of individuals that we have here, which again, I want to just appreciate everyone who applied to be a part of this and really congratulate those who have made it to be appointed here tonight, that this is a group of some excellent individuals across our city from older younger historians to newer folks to all the breadth of what we need in terms of representation i really want to just thank our chief chief brown and her team uh william belt for their work on this because again they were the ones they had to shuffle through identify everything, line everything up, make sure that they were doing their research on the ordinance because the ordinance while, again, shout out to Saskia Van James on her work, but maybe very vague to anyone that&#39;s just reading it and just wanted to really think about what is the direction that we&#39;re going in here. Recognizing through this task force, the stakeholder group that we had in those meetings that we had, that was extensive. And I just want to thank those individuals for, you know, dedicating their time with us and sharing their expertise around their thoughts, their feelings, and their hopes and wishes for what they hope to see out of this as an end result. And so just recognizing those various steps, again, this was voted in by the council in December, December 4th, I believe, of 2023. We are now June 23rd of 2025. It&#39;s been about a year, it&#39;s a year and a half. And so I think with meeting with the stakeholder groups, launching the applications, doing all those interviews of these individuals, and then getting us to this point, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s too long, especially for a new commission. If we already had a model and something to kind of work with, then I would say, sure, we should be maybe a little bit quicker. But I think this is right on cue. And I&#39;m really hopeful. that under the leadership and direction of Chief Brown and her team, that we will have that application up for the executive position. We&#39;ll welcome a phenomenal executive director to this role and position, and that we&#39;ll be able to do the work. And understanding what the actual work actually is through this group, through the chair of this committee, and look forward to the updates. Right. That that will be able to share with the council as we move this forward. But again, just recognizing this is a new commission. I just ask that you give us and give the everybody some grace through timing, through what it all looks like and recognize that there is no real. that has been the perfect model for us to say, we wanna be there. But we do have great representation of things that have taken place across the nation, including here in Massachusetts, that we are able to pull some good best practices from to really think about how we could stand up, do the work, and make sure that we are of good representation to the members of the Cambridge community. Thank you, I yield.</td>

A lot of that time was also to recognize that we were going to be asking a number of people in our community to come on this journey with us.

I wanted just to formally and on the record thank him for his time, his talent, came to the meetings, kept the notes. was a equal partner in the decision. And I&#39;m thanking you in advance because I know it&#39;s going to be a long, hard road. And I say that with excitement and a little bit of trepidation. The job that your office already takes on is large. This is probably going to be equal to that. And so I just want to be mindful of that and say to you, Mr. Ben, and to the other members of your staff, do not hesitate. to reach out to us and say we need a little bit more support the commission needs a little bit more of something because we don&#39;t want it to fail because we did not give it the proper uh attention so i with that i will yield the floor is there further council toner do you want to say anything on this no okay</td>

SO THAT&#39;S WHY WE ESTABLISHED, I THINK, THIS COMMISSION, TO HAVE THAT BE PART OF THE CITY DIALOGUE, TO UNDERSTAND HOW IT IS THAT WE ENGAGED IN IT AT VARIOUS LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT TO MOVE FORWARD.

We had a transportation committee meeting where we really focused in on the shape of the study last week. And some of the good ideas were to study existing shuttle ridership and consider consolidations of those services. building on existing mass transit, how to better publicize the shuttles and to consider point to point transportation rather than routes as we think about municipal shuttles. So I think some really good ideas came from that and we&#39;ll look forward to seeing the RFP for the study. I did want to say, again, I feel like the study is so important because it&#39;ll make it easier to get around the city. I am surprised by the cost, however. I consulted a friend who is a transportation consultant. who thought it should cost far less. And I wanted to ask, through you, Madam Mayor, what the basis is for the study estimate. Do we know how many hours they&#39;re anticipating it should take, at what rate, and why should it take a whole year? Commissioner McKenna?</td>

If we can do the study for less than that, which I certainly hope that we can, we&#39;re not gonna spend to that number. We did wanna appropriate the full amount of those mitigation funds. So we&#39;re looking to spend as little as we can while doing a very robust process for both kind of data analysis and outreach. So I think that both speaks to how much it will cost us cost us to do the study and the timeline. I think a year is, we&#39;ll do some upfront analysis that will inform the public outreach and then sufficient time for the public outreach and then wrapping up the study.</td>

We have a huge number of professors and data rich analysts and lots of people with expertise in transportation using big data. Can we bring them in and have this be a project? And not just to save money, but to tie in the institutions into the network of our city that is one of the key issues we&#39;re facing, which is transportation across the city. So I think that&#39;s a question through you. Will we be reaching out to the institutions in the city, particularly MIT, which has many different departments, and could they help us with this work?</td>

They have a lot of folks with expertise that we could benefit from. So I think we should reach out and understand if there&#39;s a match, and it could be matched up with some other consultant as well. It seems that this is that area that, again, should build on what the community knows and the closer we can have to an institutional player who, frankly, will be part of the solution. The dream is to have all our institutions, Harvard, MIT, the biotech industry, all together to say how can we have a solution one collaborative, consolidated, comprehensive system that provides affordable, frequent, and reliable service across the city in such a way that people do not feel like they have to use their cars. So I expect that to happen based on our renewed commitment to encourage institutions to be involved in our lives and see where it goes. I yield.</td>

There is, I know this for a fact, that there are great resources breath of resources right there but what would that look like for us to work within home and not invest these dollars in a place where quite frankly from my vantage point i don&#39;t see us getting the results that we need or desire from outside resources commissioner mckenna</td>

I think there&#39;s some exploration to be done for how we expand our model of community engagement to include paid participation, because I think that&#39;s something that staff has looked at in the past. There&#39;s some challenges to overcome, I think, but we are starting that process of looking at what exactly that would look like. So I can&#39;t tell you right off the bat, but we absolutely heard you, and I think that there&#39;s a lot of value there. And again, I think from the educational, from the universities, we can certainly check and see if there&#39;s some sort of alignment of folks who are looking to do this type of work and whether or not that would work.

I mean, it sounds like we have quite a bit of a timeline, like in terms of like a year to be able to do quite a bit of data. gathering and so we could probably utilize smaller focus groups we can utilize whether we&#39;re looking at students and like the actual the various population groups that we want to touch on to understand how folks in our in our city use transportation we have to have a breath of how we&#39;re doing this across the spectrum. And I just don&#39;t believe, I just don&#39;t have the confidence that an outside resource would actually provide us that breadth of the depth of data that we actually need and have the relationships within our community to deliver. So with that, I yield. Thank you. Council Wilson yields the floor for the discussion.</td>

That complies with Massachusetts General Law Section 137A. I pulled this specifically because the action was a little different than the other matters. Does anyone want to speak to this?

And they had some questions about... uh that the in the cities uh the city is requiring that dogs wear breakaway in in when they&#39;re in the kennel that they wear breakaway collars with their rabies vaccinations and license on the collar That is actually, from our understanding, is not a requirement in the state law. It&#39;s something that we&#39;re doing. And I just was wondering if we could get an explanation for that, because they&#39;re saying it&#39;s just difficult. They have to switch collars. They have to switch tags. And it&#39;s for them while they&#39;re inside the building. So I&#39;m just wondering if Christine can explain why we&#39;re doing that. And is it outside the state law or part of the state law? Ms. Carrera, did you hear the question?</td>

And I just want to point out some of what it allows to do and through you to the staff by allowing us to increase the enforcement with the fines. It seems like that&#39;s one of the ways we have all heard issues where sometimes neighbors don&#39;t feel that we are regularly enforcing this. That this allows us, clarifies the rules and regulations under which people will have to ensure that their dogs are operating safely and it gives our staff then more ability to intervene in a dangerous situation across the city, which makes it safer for our residents, but also I think better for our staff as they deal with this. I believe that was the whole thrust of this, and we can either confirm it, I see Ms. Correa nodding her head, I don&#39;t need any answer. But I thank very much all the staff for working on this to address this, because it&#39;s been a problem in a number of instances. And when it happens, it&#39;s hard for us to say we can&#39;t really do anything about it. So thank you, Mayor Simmons, I yield.</td>

                <td>Thank you, Madam Mayor. Also, I just wanted to say I think this is a good idea to update this code and I thought that the timing of our reviewing this in this morning seemed so ironic to me because there was a nuisance dog that was barking for two hours straight from 5.30 to 7.30 right outside my window this morning. I hope it doesn&#39;t happen again next morning. But it&#39;s important to have rules about nuisance dogs and dangerous dogs. And then Councilor McGovern and I have recently been contacted about a dangerous dog at a condo association that is threatening residents. Anyway, we live in a very dense city, and it&#39;s essential that we have clear rules and that we respect neighbors&#39; needs for peace, quiet, and safety. And I feel like these ordinance updates will do that. So I thank all who participated in this. Thank you. I yield.</td>

                <td> Thank you very much Mayor Simmons, and thank you for pulling this really important, I think, ordinance proposal. As people know, we&#39;ve been talking about this for a while. I&#39;m really glad we finally have these draft changes. It originally began with a policy order I filed almost two years ago with Councilors Azeem and Siddiqui. The city originally began regulating short term rentals in 2017, yet we haven&#39;t had any comprehensive reporting on Many residents have struggled with unregulated or illegal short term rentals in their neighborhoods. Our city staff has not had the ability really to enforce when questions are raised and it can be a real issue. Many other cities since 2017 have taken steps to regulate them, so we should really do everything we can to do this. Just to remind us all, we received an interim report in October 2024 from Commissioner McLaughlin indicating at the time there were 168 registered short-term rentals in Cambridge, and online records indicated that there were at least 515 short term rentals available in Cambridge, meaning there were over 300 unregistered ones in the city. So I have a number of questions related to this, including how are these changes going to address our ability to regulate? The biggest question is enforcement. There&#39;s one right by my, two blocks from my house, where it&#39;s pretty clear to anyone who looks at it, just like the one on James Way, which we have had a number of people here. that the residents are claiming, well, I own a two-family, but sometimes I live in one side and then sometimes I live in the other side, and they switch every week, it seems, because both of them are available for rentals. It&#39;s almost certain that it&#39;s actually an illegal rental. So some of these questions, and in particular, That one about how we make sure if you have an owner adjacent right next to an owner, just a separate one, do we make sure that if you&#39;re switching back and forth, you have to register as an actual owner occupied. And therefore, every time you change your occupancy, you need to re-register, which means pay another $500 fee. I think that&#39;s the kind of creative solution we can have to make sure that people aren&#39;t gaming the system. SUMMERVILLE IS A 90 DAY PER YEAR LIMIT ON WHOLE UNIT RENTALS. DO WE CONSIDER A LIMIT LIKE THAT? I DON&#39;T KNOW IF THIS IS THE TIME TO GO OVER ALL OF THESE OR FOR ME TO GATHER THESE AND THEN ALL OF US TO SEND THEM TO THE CITY STAFF IN ANTICIPATION OF THE ORDINANCE MEETING, BUT I DO THINK IT&#39;S REALLY IMPORTANT for us to all review the work that was done by the city staff on this, reviewing a range of cities. Some of them were included, some of them were not. And that idea that there&#39;s hundreds of rental units in this city that are not apartments, right? We have an affordable housing crisis and instead we have hundreds and hundreds of units. and maybe even more that aren&#39;t registered or are registered on other things it it has contributed i think to to our i think need as a city to understand what is the extent of this and to understand how we can better enforce it so i think the specific question is how best to communicate these kinds of questions about how this will affect enforcement and other creative ideas to make sure that people who are abusing the system now will not be allowed to do that in the future</td>

And I don&#39;t want to speak on how we were kind of stymied by the law. I think that&#39;s best for the law department.

But I do hope before we go down any path beyond just, you know, making these changes in the ordinance and updating the the language and providing ISD with the tools to enforce what we currently have on the books. I think we really need to have a broader conversation as a council and a community about what we want to do. Just this past few months, I&#39;ve encountered a number of Cambridge residents who have, especially retirees, who are supplementing their income by Airbnb-ing rooms in their house, or when they go on vacation, renting out their home through airbnb so i just want to make sure that if we do start talking about going any further on restrictions of airbnb that we let people who are registered airbnb folks know and can be part of the conversation and not have it just be a conversation of the council where we come up with rules that folks in the community to know about MAYBE THAT&#39;S A PLACE FOR THE HOUSING COMMITTEE OR THE LONG-TERM NEIGHBOR PLANNING COMMITTEE TO HAVE A HEARING. BUT I REALLY DO THINK BEFORE WE GO ANY FURTHER WITH FURTHER RESTRICTIONS, WE NEED TO ALERT THE COMMUNITY THAT WE&#39;RE TALKING ABOUT IT AND HAVE THAT CONVERSATION. THANK YOU, MADAM MAYOR. I YIELD.</td>

And Boston had to go through a court case for that. And as of now, I think the law department has gone to a point where we&#39;ve come up with these new short term rental the new ordinance so we can take care of troubled people or troubled renters. And I understand Mr. Toner wanting to have, not taking them away, but it&#39;s real difficult to try to identify who&#39;s renting one out when we can&#39;t get Airbnb on the same side as us. So that&#39;s where the difficulty comes in.</td>

I&#39;m kind of with Council Toner on this one, where I just want to agree that we want to make sure that we&#39;re not going to do or cause, and these weren&#39;t his words, so I&#39;m going to put this out there. unintentional consequences to this process in terms of those who may be living on fixed incomes and trying to supplement. So I&#39;m just very curious as we continue this conversation, if there&#39;s any way for us to gather some information, some data, as to the who like who currently owns um and who currently has their homes um registered as short-term rentals and then if there is knowledge of other spaces or places that have but are not maybe registered through the proper channels if there&#39;s a way to understand why because i think also what will be a bit challenging is trying to enforce And again, I think that that will cause an additional burden on a family or an individual that&#39;s already in a very fixed income burden kind of position to have some additional fees be taxed on to them. So while I appreciate and understand the importance of this, I also don&#39;t want to cause any additional harm to individuals in our community. Deputy O&#39;Riordan.</td>

                <td> Through you, Mayor Simmons, I fully understand, Councillor, as to what you&#39;re saying. I think for the Inspectional Services Department, the challenge up to now has been there are a number of people who are operating either on Airbnb or Vrbo that are not registered with the city. We&#39;ve had conversations with both Airbnb and Verba, and they have committed to actually not putting properties on their system without them being registered with the city moving forward. And so to some extent, there&#39;s a responsibility on those entities to make sure that if indeed an entity, somebody is registering for Airbnb or Verba, that they&#39;re also registered with the city. And for them, I think the compelling issue from their perspective is We expect to inspect these facilities to make sure that there are no fire prevention issues. There are no code issues that continue to exist associated with these properties. And so it both protects the person who&#39;s renting and the homeowner in case something goes wrong. And so I think there&#39;s an alignment between us and these various companies moving forward so that we all operate with the same understanding and that when somebody does rent out their property for a number of days that they&#39;re doing so recognizing that these properties have been inspected and that they conform with local ordinances and laws. And so I think as a result of some of the court cases that have happened across the country, be it in New York or in Boston, there&#39;s a realization that we&#39;re not trying to eliminate Airbnbs or indeed short-term rentals, but rather want to work with them to make sure that they&#39;re operating safely moving forward. And so I think we have actually come into more alignment than we have previous to this in terms of our ultimate philosophy in terms of this. So I do think that the possibility of us communicating more directly with people who are proposing short-term rentals has increased fairly dramatically as a result of that.</td>

This concludes the non-consent agenda for the City Manager. We will move now to... policy orders and resolutions, but one quick question, Mr. City Manager, before you attempt to take your leave. I know that we talked just briefly about cooling centers because of the temperature, and if my colleagues would indulge me, I&#39;d like to suspend the rules to have the City Manager give us a brief report. So on suspension, on the rules, to have the City Manager give a brief report on cooling centers and water facilities. Roll call.</td>

                <td> Thank you so much. Through you, Mayor Simmons, we&#39;re certainly very aware of the very hot weather today and going into tomorrow. I think the heat index is going to go up even more tomorrow and we will hopefully get some relief on Wednesday. We&#39;ve been sending out a number of emails and outreach efforts just to continue to inform the community of the efforts that are happening and the resources that are available. I would say that the primary locations that we are offering for cooling spaces are city buildings. And so in particular, the libraries that we have located in many different neighborhoods, I would unfortunately report that we are having some challenges with the HVAC at the Valente branch. And so that branch library is closed today and likely will remain closed tomorrow. but all other branches of the library are open during regular hours. They&#39;ll have water bubblers available and we really want to welcome people to use those spaces. They&#39;re spaces that our community wants to be in and they&#39;re safe and cool. The Senior Center is also available for seniors. There&#39;s a schedule and activities that we have sent out. for that to be available. We&#39;ve also been encouraging folks to use some of the community buildings that are public spaces. Both our local universities generously offer some of their buildings as spaces for the public to be in. MIT continues a pilot program called Cool Spots. which has air conditioned locations where residents are welcome to come hang out, stay cool, partake in activities. There&#39;s information available online at MIT. We sort of have this in the communication that goes out. The Harvard Smith Center as well is public space. It&#39;s very nice in terms of having a place for people to sit, spend time, be cool. And then finally, Cambridgeside. So that mall has seen a pretty significant refresh and is good open space for people. We&#39;ve also worked really hard and I know staff have done a lot to ensure that our pools are open. So the War Memorial Recreational Center Gold Star Pool are open and the pool schedules are available online. DCR also has a number of pools that have been open and are available in Cambridge and close by. And finally, a lot of the water features in our parks have been turned on. Those are all available for families, children, and adults as well, if they would like to use the water facilities at our parks. We&#39;re encouraging people to check on their neighbors. I think a lot of our community resilience is really being connected to the people that you&#39;re living close to. And so especially if there are folks that don&#39;t have air conditioning or need an air conditioning, please check in on them. And I would note there&#39;s a pretty significant effort focused on those who are unhoused and who are out in elements. And so first step is distributing extra water. The Health Alliance has a street medicine team that&#39;s available Monday through Thursday. And the care team is also increasing their outreach and providing water to those who are unhoused. The Cambridge public safety departments, both fire and police and pro-EMS will also have cold water available and be distributing that. Finally, our shelters are also extending their hours and offering critical services during the heat wave. And so 240 Albany, First Church and Salvation Army all have extended daytime hours during the next few days. and we&#39;re distributing water. Salvation Army also offers shower services as well as 240 Albany and First Church. So I think those are the main updates. I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;ve missed anything, but happy to take questions as well.</td>

I&#39;ve certainly seen cats carried around, and maybe there are those who are more expert in feline behavior, but I would say some of the public spaces... We have a few cat experts among us. I think some of the public spaces would be fine, and so I would probably encourage those as spaces to go to. It&#39;s a little bit harder in spaces like the library, where obviously only service animals are allowed.</td>

So maybe the best recommendation might be to contact the Animal Commission and get advice as to where you might be able to go with your animal. Is there any questions from the floor?

There&#39;s the Artesani Playground, and then there&#39;s also the Francis McCray Memorial Pool at 349 Rinjav, which is also open. I think it has the same hours as Magazine Beach, but if you go to DCR Pools and Spray Decks, you&#39;ll find the hours for that pool. And I also know that the... Five Star Gold, Gold Star Mother&#39;s Park Pool is also opening on the 24th tomorrow. So that will be another resource for everyone. Thank you.</td>

I mean, I would assume that some of the folks who may go to the mall might be unhoused folks, and I don&#39;t want... them getting kicked out into the heat. So maybe notifying our police department or others to make sure that we&#39;re working with folks that are non-city buildings to be a little more lenient over the next few days. Thanks.</td>

                <td>In policy order number two and number four are adopted the affirmative vote of nine members. We&#39;re going to go back to number one. This was pulled by the mayor and offered by the mayor. It reads as follows that the city council go on record expressing its profound disappointment over Apex cleaning energy decision to forego the use of labor. Local union labor on the Bowman Wind Project. First of all, I want to ask that we amend This order, my office, we omitted the vice mayor, so I&#39;d like to amend it to add the vice mayor as a co-sponsor. And in addition, some things I just wanted to say about this order. It&#39;s my intention to lay it on the table. I had a very brief conversation with the city manager today in deference to him and having a little bit more further conversation with the vice APPROPRIATE VOTE OF THE COUNCIL, I WILL LAY IT ON THE TABLE, BUT IF ANYONE WANTS TO SPEAK TO IT, I&#39;LL, YOU KNOW, LET&#39;S HAVE THAT CONVERSATION AND THEN I&#39;LL ASK FOR A MOTION TO PUT IT ON THE TABLE. BUT HAVING SAID THAT, I JUST WANT TO, I DO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE TONY PINI FROM LIUNA, PAUL GOODRIDGE FROM LABORERS UNION, NEW ENGLAND REGIONAL ORGANIZATION, and Steve Cortina from North Dakota, all who came together to bring this issue to our attention, to myself, to Councilor Toner, and to the Vice Mayor. And Tony and the folks at LIUNA are among my trusted advisors on labor issues. And so when they reach out and say, Mayor Simmons, we may have a labor issue percolating, it sets off alarms for me and compels me to look into what&#39;s going on. So last year, when Cambridge entered into the agreement with North Dakota, it represented a novel and innovative approach to promoting clean energy and reducing our carbon footprint. And we were very optimistic about the potential benefits. However, LIUNA has raised concerns that while Cambridge may be reaping the environmental benefits, the skilled laborers on the ground in North Dakota may not be receiving the respect or the opportunities that they deserve. Specifically, LIUNA has advised that Apex Clean Energy has prioritized cheaper non-union, non-local workers over qualified local union labor, a move that runs counter to the principles of fairness and economic justice that we hold dear. Efforts by LIUNA representatives to engage APEX on issues that have been sent with polite but evasive responses, which only deepens my concern. And I want to note for the record that representatives from APEX have reached out to me to discuss their perspective. And I get that my schedule has not allowed for this meeting, maybe in this brief period where it&#39;s laid on the table we can do that. Nonetheless, I want to be clear, bringing these concerns into the open is essential. If this attention prompts Apex to prioritize aligning its labor practices with the values Cambridge stands for, then the policy order will proceed. Cambridge has long been a leader in marrying ambitious climate actions with social justice and workplace fairness. We expect our partners to uphold the same standards. I urge other municipalities, institutions, and stakeholders to exercise their due diligence and demand ironclad commitments to local skilled labor and all clean energy projects. You&#39;ve heard me say a number of times, about doing the right thing the wrong way, and this is my impression that that speaks to this. So in short, clean energy cannot come at the expense of the hard working communities it is intended to serve. So I will yield the floor. I&#39;ve asked to add the Vice Mayor. Is there any more discussion on this issue? Council Wilson, the floor is yours.</td>

I would perhaps start to say that we recognize the importance of union labor and that is something that I&#39;ve seen added in as a stipulation in different governmental contracts. I would defer to the solicitor a bit. I believe we&#39;ve actually had discussions about to what extent local municipalities have the ability in these kinds of contracts to require different labor practices or prevailing wages. I think aside from that, there is deep concern from the perspective of the city that this is a process that we have been going through for many years. We did meet in executive session with the city council to discuss the contract negotiations that we were having in order to enter into this agreement, we have then entered into this agreement. And as part of that agreement, we did not put in a requirement around what is being requested. And so at this point in time, we would have pretty deep concerns for the city council, ultimately as the governance body representing the city of Cambridge, to be commenting after a contract has been finalized to reopen different stipulations that were not actually in the negotiation. I think this would put us at risk both in terms of potential breach of contract. It would open us to a level of legal risk and liability that we would be very uncomfortable with. And I think in addition, there are specific provisions within the contract that are concerning in terms of the specific text in the order, in the policy order. So I would perhaps turn it over to Solicitor Beyer just to check my summary statements. But I think we can also provide some of this in writing or discuss it with counselors separately before any action is taken on the policy order.</td>

I can&#39;t speak for the entire council, I can speak only for myself. the council may or may not follow suit. If this requires an executive session, we can call one day to do that if that&#39;s required or allowed. That being said, based on what you&#39;ve said and I hear what you&#39;re saying, I&#39;ve not been sufficiently moved and I&#39;ll tell you why. My concern is that while we are reaping the benefit in having something that we can give to the folks of our city at a reduced cost, I feel like we&#39;re doing it on the bridge called someone else&#39;s back. And so that&#39;s where I struggle. And so I look forward, and again, this is why I&#39;ve asked my colleagues to lay this on the table, to allow us to have a brief, some conversation on it, but right now, I don&#39;t feel as though I&#39;m in a place where I would want to change. I have put this forward. My colleagues have followed me with this, and I appreciate that. I will bow to them if they want to give some more comments. But again, I&#39;ve laid this on the table so that we can have more conversation. I just think it&#39;s troubling. that we, for whatever reason we got there, are dancing with the devil. So I will yield the floor. I don&#39;t know, Solicitor Beer, if you want to reserve your comments for another time, or do you want to hear more from the floor? Tell me what&#39;s your pleasure.</td>

It&#39;s just to clarify that this agreement, this virtual power purchasing agreement is to purchase environmental attributes from electricity generated by wind power. And so the city entered into a contract for those environmental attributes to offset the city&#39;s electric use and the community aggregations electric use. But the city, it&#39;s a little bit different than a contract for construction. The city isn&#39;t part of the actual construction of the wind plant in North Dakota. Our agreement is just for after it&#39;s constructed. We have entered into this agreement to buy these environmental attributes. Thank you. So that is just one bit of background information. And then there are terms to that agreement that the city has entered into. There is a signed contract. The city did this as part of consortium with other purchasers that include MIT and Harvard. And all the consortium members were working together. AND WE ALSO AS PART OF THIS CONTRACT HAVE TERMS WE HAVE TO ABIDE TO AND SOME OF THOSE INCLUDE HOW WE&#39;RE REPRESENTING THIS PROJECT AND WORKING TOGETHER WITH THE DEVELOPER OF THE PROJECT TO REPRESENT WHAT THE CITY AND THE OTHER CONSORTIUM MEMBERS AND THE DEVELOPER ARE ALL DOING THROUGH THIS PROJECT.</td>

                <td>THANK YOU. THROUGH YOU. There may be some terminology or some words and some of the whereases that may be strong and folks feel a little uncomfortable about, but I&#39;m looking at the orders and I&#39;m just not, The ordered section says, the first order, that the city council go on record expressing his profound disappointment over Apex Clean Energy&#39;s decision to forego the use of local union labor on the Bowman Wind project, an omission that stands in stark contrast to Cambridge&#39;s longstanding values of fairness, economic justice, and support for a skilled local workforce. That&#39;s not asking us to back out of a contract. It&#39;s not asking us to change the contract we agreed to. We&#39;re going on record saying, You&#39;re creepy people. We&#39;re disappointed, right? And we have every right to go on record and say we&#39;re not asking anyone at Cambridge to get out of anything. The second order that the city council go on record urging other municipalities, government bodies, educational institutions, and private entities to exercise extreme caution before entering into a similar agreement with Apex Energy and to seek ironclad assurances that labor and local hiring practices will align with the highest standard of social responsibility. Again, not asking us to get out of a contract. just saying we&#39;re disappointed and we want to warn others to be careful. And then the last order is just send a suitably engrossed copy. So I&#39;m not sure. I mean, I try not to read between. When you write a policy order, you write, and especially in the ordered sections, you write what it means and what it wants to mean. And I think sometimes people read between the lines and say, well, what they&#39;re really saying is this. This isn&#39;t asking us to change a contract. This isn&#39;t asking us to back out of anything. This is just saying we think this is wrong and we want to go on record stating that we think this is wrong. So I&#39;m not sure where the concern is from the city and the solicitor&#39;s office saying this might somehow jeopardize our contract. We&#39;re not asking you to jeopardize anything.</td>

We can do one better because I know people are actually melting in the room here. One person in particular who will not be named. So maybe we would just hold this conversation. We have amended it. Thank you for reminding me of that. And we&#39;re going to move on to another agenda item. So go to a cooler spot. You can get out of the hot seat. Thank you so much. We will now move to the next item that was pulled. It was pulled by Councilor Siddiqui. It reads as follows, that the city manager being hereby is requested to direct the city solicitor in consultation with the relevant city department and community benefits advisory committee to draft amendments to the community benefits ordinance that allow for the use of funds capital expenses provided that such expenses clearly advance the goals of the community benefits program. This is pulled by Councilor Siddiqui. Councilor Siddiqui is the lead sponsor. The floor is yours.</td>

This was sponsored by Councillor Wilson, Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler, Vice Mayor McGovern and as it says it&#39;s to call for some amendments to the ordinance and by way of background as was mentioned this work started in 2015 And needs have evolved. We&#39;ve heard from various nonprofits about the different needs. And so after we discussed this with city staff and others, it was recommended we put in this PO. I think the intent also is to have a further discussion in Human Services as well, and so that&#39;s really the background. One amendment I&#39;m going to say to the floor is in the last ordered we say that the city manager is being hereby requested to direct the city solicitor to you know draft amendments and then it says at the end provided that such expenses clearly advance the goals of the community benefits program and i would add any other suggested benefits i&#39;m sorry amendments that may not be mentioned here because there may be others that the staff may suggest to us so that was my amendment to add after community benefits program to say and and any other suggested amendments and be it further ordered that the city manager report back</td>

This is obviously not happening by June 30th. So I see these as two very, as two separate, two completely separate things.</td>

The reason that I think this is so important, and I thank you for writing this policy order, is that I&#39;ve just been shocked that Cambridge legacy nonprofits have failing facilities, and they all lack endowments. So I think if there isn&#39;t an opportunity for us to use community benefits to help them improve their facilities, I don&#39;t see that they&#39;ll have a source of funds for this. And also at the Cambridge Nonprofit Coalition last week, The Cambridge Community Foundation&#39;s Elizabeth Patton gave a presentation. Cambridge has over 578 active nonprofits and a total of 1,244 nonprofits. We have a lot of them. They provide tremendous benefit for the city. And some of them have really a great need for improved facilities. So I think it&#39;s important that funding capital expenses be an option with community benefits. Thank you. I yield.</td>

Through you to my colleagues, I want to appreciate the, you know, being a co-sponsor on this and just recognizing the various complexities, but also just the intention behind the Community Benefits Fund, the, you know, little bit of history around it and just understanding, like, is this actually fitting for our nonprofit providers today? But given the restrictions around infrastructure, capital infrastructure, as well as other things, we recognize that there&#39;s a deeper conversation that we need to have. And so as co-chair of Human Services, I appreciate the fact that we discussed this. referring a motion a couple weeks ago or maybe months ago now, I can&#39;t even remember, that we will have this conversation before that committee. And this just gives us a little bit more of a layout for what more to be discussing and making sure that we&#39;re taking that piece again around infrastructure, capital expenses, and other things that may come up. to have that conversation, but also to hear from our nonprofit providers on just the operations today, right, and just how things are flowing today. We recognize, to my colleague&#39;s point, around we have several organizations that are in some buildings that are just not â not okay, right? And so there&#39;s a lot of work that needs to be done across the board and we have programs that are a century plus old that are doing great work in our communities that deserve to look like they are being cared for and especially by a city where we are investing some significant dollars in other things that we are working together and making sure that we are providing those spaces for our programs to thrive and for our communities to feel like they belong. So I look forward to this conversation. I look forward to my colleagues supporting this policy order and we shall move forward from there.</td>

                <td>Thank you so much, Mayor Simmons, and thank you to everyone working on this. As Councilor Siddiqui said, this has been talked about at various times. And as Vice Mayor McGovern noted, Councilor Carlone came and said the original intent of the council was not necessarily to exclude it. So this is somewhat overdue, thanks to all the councillors who are bringing this forward. and to ensure that what we&#39;re doing is having a more comprehensive, clear, and transparent process by which we hope we would come together and understand. Sometimes we have community benefits here, and then we have some other pool over here, and then we have the community foundation. It&#39;s really important, just like when we provide after-school care, which we&#39;re coordinating now and understanding the whole ecosystem. Similarly, with the various ways that development dollars flow into our city, how is it that they&#39;re being used? Some of them gets used through INCREASED TAX REVENUE, WHICH THEN THE CITY COUNCIL DIRECTS, BUT THEN THERE&#39;S A RANGE OF OTHERS THAT COME THROUGH VARIOUS MEANS. SO IT&#39;S REALLY IMPORTANT THIS CONVERSATION WILL MOVE FORWARD, AND I UNDERSTAND IT WILL AFFECT ALL FUTURE PROJECTS. AS VICE MAYOR SAID, IT WILL BE, I&#39;M SURE, A LITTLE WHILE BEFORE WE HAVE ORDINANCE LANGUAGE BEFORE IT, BUT I LOOK FORWARD TO SUPPORTING THIS AND TO GETTING THIS DONE IN A WAY THAT IF THAT&#39;S THE GREATEST NEED OF A NONPROFIT TO CONTINUE THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE AND THEIR building or their construction, then that&#39;s what we should be funding so that they can provide those programs. And it has been said, as Councilor Wilson noted, there&#39;s a number of needs lacking here. We have now spent so much money as a city upgrading facilities in some areas. Let&#39;s try to see if we can have a more, I think, coordinated approach to funding non-profits. So thank you all for sponsoring this, and I will be supporting it.</td>

I don&#39;t even know another word right now. to Malaney Council and Kenny Utavicki for really forming this space and creating this community that&#39;s built around love of music, hip-hop, R&amp;B, dancehall reggae, just so much joy that&#39;s in that space each and every month and for it to be a once a month space, they often sell out. And individuals that are coming into this space are just overjoyed. So I just want to say congratulations to them, wishing them many more years of success. And again, they were highlighted in the Globe. I look forward to presenting this resolution to them this Sunday, and yeah, just really proud of their efforts. Wonderful. Thank you.</td>

Thursday night&#39;s Preservation Awards, which the mayor spoke at, was a great feel-good event to hear about significant buildings lovingly restored under the guidance of Charlie Sullivan and our Cambridge Historical Commission. Among the buildings receiving awards were three city buildings, including City Hall right here, the Inman Fire Station, and the Harvard Square Kiosk. Three Harvard buildings also won awards, Gund Hall that I hadn&#39;t realized was so leaky before it was restored, and then the two sustainable living houses on Kirkland and Sacramento streets. St. Augustine&#39;s African Orthodox Church, a project that I co-initiated with architect Gabe Syrah in 2018 with the Cambridge Port Neighborhood Association, also won an award. And again, So many people that have been involved with that project since 2018 were there. Missing were Chris Menjopra, though, of Black History in Action for Cambridgeport, who is a new father, and the Eccles brothers, who have really devoted their lives to the restoration and the continuance of St. Augustine&#39;s African Orthodox Church. All of these projects require time, money, and attention to detail, and provide the community with tremendous benefit, preserving the architectural character and variety of Cambridge. So it was a great night, and again, I&#39;m proud to be a co-sponsor with Councilor Wilson on this resolution. Thank you. I yield.</td>

I want to also appreciate the efforts of all of the awardees. I can just celebrate them. I was unable to participate while I had all hopes to participate. get there that evening um but traffic wasn&#39;t on my side and the several other events that were um going on that that evening did not allow me to get here to city hall so um i felt like this was the next best thing to be able to celebrate these individuals and to highlight them and and um just say i look forward to the next century of years that they&#39;re able to support and service our community so you know just i&#39;m happy that our city does and invest in historical spaces and and making sure that they are preserved in and getting that recognition so again this was the least that i could do recognizing not only my absence but um also noting that they worked hard so thank you</td>

And the council only heard about the hearing being scheduled for whatever reason Friday afternoon. So we did not get a chance to put this on the agenda. on the regular agenda um but it the ordered itself is is up there which is basically that we we go on record as a council asking them to pass what we already passed and sent forward as a home rule petition which passed unanimously of the city council and this came out of the an email that the a city solicitor sent indicating that the committee thought it might be helpful to have what it was, a summary of the charter home rule petition that we had passed. So that&#39;s what this represents. It&#39;s a letter that hopefully will be passed and then sent with all of us, after which I would like to file reconsideration to ensure that the clerk will be able to send this first thing in the morning. The hearing is tomorrow from 1 to 5. It summarizes our discussions and again, this is the humble we&#39;ve been waiting for for a while and the election commission needs to make sure this gets passed in time if we can by the state legislature so that it can do all the work that would be required for this to be on the ballot in November.</td>

There&#39;ll be food in the second floor hallway and then there&#39;ll be a brief program as it is expressed in our rules, that we can do special presentations just before the meeting. So it&#39;ll be at 5 o&#39;clock here in the council chamber. Also, for those that just enjoy dancing, Friday is the dance party. So I just want to remind people that we&#39;ll be dancing in the streets. It starts at 5. It should be a great time to be had by all. I understand it has a revolutionary theme. I can&#39;t wait to see that. And so I will yield the floor with those two announcements unless I missed something, Mr. Alpert. Councillor.</td>

This is a free... This event is free and is a great opportunity to support local businesses and discover unique products. The other thing that I just wanted to emphasize was something that our city manager mentioned earlier and around. It is hot outside and it is important that we take care of and look out for our neighbors. So just please take advantage of cool spaces throughout our city and just stay out of the heat, but stay hydrated. Thank you.</td>
