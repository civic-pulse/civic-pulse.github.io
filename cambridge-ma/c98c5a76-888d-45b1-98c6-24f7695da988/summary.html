<li>Jimmy D'Angelo (Housing Inspector) noted restrictions on enforcement but mentioned establishing relationships with companies like Airbnb to address illegal listings.</li>
<li>Attorney Elliot Veloso (Solicitor's Office) stated the revisions aim to increase ISD's enforcement ability and clarify conditions for registered operator-occupied units.</li>
<li>Councilor Toner expressed concern about potential negative impacts on residents, especially retirees supplementing income, and advocated for broader community conversation before further restrictions.</li>
