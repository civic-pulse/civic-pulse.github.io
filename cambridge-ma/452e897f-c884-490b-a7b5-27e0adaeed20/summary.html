<li>Adjacent uses include Russell Apartments (residential), retail, and the historic Henderson Carriage Building.</li>
<li><strong>Zoning:</strong> BA2 zoning district with a portion in C1; corridor site under AHO, allowing for greater densities and heights (up to 13 stories).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Design Goals:</strong><ul>
<li>Transform underutilized site into an elegant, contemporary building.</li>
<li>Create meaningful connections and shared experiences for residents (community spaces, rooftop garden).</li>
<li>Deliver high-quality, family-sized apartment homes with good daylight and views.</li>
<li>Utilize mass timber construction, healthy indoor materials, and air quality.</li>
<li>Meet sustainability objectives (Passive House, energy/water conservation, carbon sequestration, resiliency).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Design Concept:</strong><ul>
<li>Mass timber structure (rhythmic, repetitive, interior warmth).</li>
<li>Lifted 16 feet off the ground for active ground floor.</li>
<li>Cladding reflects grid with warm, neutral-colored frame and textured panels.</li>
<li>Highlighting the corner with a transparent community space at street level and a visible roof garden.</li>
<li>Digital massing model presented from various angles.</li>
<li>Facade articulation using reveals and material layers to break down mass.</li>
<li>Warm tone materials and large openings for a modern language.</li>
<li>Relationship to Henderson Carriage Building (expressive structure, repetition, rhythm).</li>
<li>Relationship to Russell apartment building.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Walden Street Improvements:</strong> Widening of Walden Street by giving back a couple of feet from the property line to allow for proper traffic flow (two 10-foot travel lanes). Building will be cantilevered.</li>

<li><strong>Mass Timber Benefits (Simon Mance):</strong> Low carbon footprint, carbon sequestration, shortened construction schedules (prefabricated), efficient for urban infill, supports sustainable forest management, biophilic benefits for occupants, mitigates adverse environmental impacts (quieter construction). Examples of mass timber projects (Ascent, Heartwood) shown.</li>
<li><strong>Elevations:</strong> North, West (Walden Street), South (city parking lot), East (Russell Apartments) facades presented.</li>
<li><strong>Specific Views:</strong> From Creighton Street and within the Russell Apartments garden, showing relationship to existing structures and a linden tree.</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Public Comment:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Young Kim (530 Community):</strong> Submitted letters and a petition (157 residents). Concerns about potential improper use of affordable housing trust funds, absence of adaptive standards for high-rise mass timber in Cambridge, and accessibility deficiencies (parking, drop-off, path to units). Urged deferral until clear standards for mass timber and accessibility/funding oversight are ensured. Suggested rounding corners of the angular tower.</li>
<li><strong>Pamela Winters:</strong> Questioned the increase in height from previous proposals. Asked about distance from the senior center, resident parking, and mandated handicap parking.</li>
<li><strong>Bill McIvenny (12 Douglas Street):</strong> Appreciated the project moving forward, the need for affordable housing, the well-thought-out design, and the increased height for more housing. Appreciated not encouraging additional cars.</li>
<li><strong>Rachel Miller (11 Walden Street):</strong> Expressed excitement for a large affordable housing structure in the neighborhood despite living across from a construction site. Supported the project and noted that many on affordable housing waitlists do not own cars.</li>
<li><strong>Helen Walker (43 Lennon Street):</strong> Architect with healthy building experience. Praised the handsome building and use of GFRC. Raised concerns about mass timber: sick building syndrome from formaldehyde in glues (unless 100% no-formaldehyde specified), fireproofing (2-hour ratings, use of drywall, fire retardant treatments as sources of poor air quality). Urged going beyond normal certifications for healthy solutions for residents.</li>
<li><strong>Benjamin Kane (205 Walden Street):</strong> Expressed excitement for the development of an underutilized lot. Highlighted the serious shortage of affordable housing in Cambridge and the positive impact of such projects. Praised the building's design.</li>
<li><strong>David Halprin (14 Valentine Street, Unit 3):</strong> Echoed previous speaker's comments on the underutilized lot. Praised the beautiful design and the high-efficiency building near public transit as a good approach to the housing crisis.</li>
<li><strong>Sean Smeland (2130 Mass Ave):</strong> Happy about affordable housing and the use of the lot. Excited about widening Walden Street. Noted concerns from his building residents about height and traffic. Questioned the increase to 12 stories, finding it an "eyesore" and preferring a 6-story height.</li>
<li><strong>Marilee Meyer (10 Dana Street):</strong> Glad for 100% affordable housing. Questions: single vs. multiple elevators/stairs (for escape), trash pickup location, access to city parking lot for loading/unloading, lack of active tenant area around the building. Echoed concerns about formaldehyde and fire rating. Suggested earth tone colors and breaking up the facade with different colors in channels.</li>
<li><strong>Lee Farris (Norfolk Street):</strong> Liked 30% and 60% AMI units (asked for breakdown). Enthusiastic about mass timber but noted formaldehyde concerns. Concerns about large rectangular frames covering two floors and the ratio of glass to solid wall (preferring less glass for environmental and visual reasons). Questions: grilling on roof garden, proximity to Russell Apartments, growing space for residents on roof, loading/unloading given tight Walden Street and busy Mass Ave.</li>
<li><strong>John Gasly (11 Wright Street):</strong> Loved the design. Main concern: traffic during construction on Walden Street (major cut-through). Asked if Walden Street widening would be done prior to or after building construction.</li>
<li><strong>James Zoll (203 Pemberton Street):</strong> Pleased to see the project back and improved with more resident space. Appreciated that more people understand the housing approval process and hoped for no new delays.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Board Member Questions and Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Diego Macias:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Formaldehyde:</strong> Asked for clarification on formaldehyde in mass timber and indoor air quality.</li>
<li><strong>City Parking Lot:</strong> Inquired about the city lot behind the property and potential for dedicated loading/unloading for residents.</li>
<li><strong>Walden Street Construction:</strong> Asked about the timing of Walden Street widening relative to building construction.</li>
<li><strong>Applicant Response (Sean Hope, Jason Forney):</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Formaldehyde:</strong> Acknowledged formaldehyde in various building products. Stated interest in non-formaldehyde mass timber, though not a commitment. Noted Green Guard certification (7.3 parts per billion, below EPA/WHO standards). Emphasized building commissioning and flushing for indoor air quality. Stated mass timber is not new technology (2200+ buildings in US), regulated by state building code (2021 IBC type 4B).</li>
<li><strong>Parking/Loading:</strong> Informal discussions with city for a drop-off zone or use of city parking lot at rear. Sensitive to neighborhood use of lot.</li>
<li><strong>Walden Street Construction:</strong> Intent to do simultaneously, but detailed schedule not yet developed. Utilities mostly on Walden Street. Eversource electrical duct bank under sidewalk is a factor; 95-99% confident widening will work. Will provide more clarity at next meeting.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Ashley Tan:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Trash/Fire Room Entrances:</strong> Asked for materiality and size details for entrances on Mass Ave, given bus stop proximity.</li>
<li><strong>Roof Garden:</strong> Asked for examples of high-rise residential roof gardens and how they are utilized.</li>
<li><strong>Zoning:</strong> Questioned if the project would be subject to new Mass Ave zoning, given upcoming hearings.</li>
<li><strong>Staff Response (Jeff Roberts):</strong> AHO supersedes base zoning; new Mass Ave zoning is not expected to impact this AHO development.</li>
<li><strong>Applicant Response (Jason Forney, Sean Hope):</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Entrances:</strong> Plan to use high-quality material (elongated brick), design doors to be discreet, potentially incorporate into facade/planters. Acknowledge need for more detail. Bus stop location may change with Mass Ave transportation planning.</li>
<li><strong>Roof Garden:</strong> Many tall roof gardens exist (e.g., 20th floor in Boston). Working with landscape architect (Ground). Focus on right plants, tranquility, and activity. Sean Hope added intent for high railings (glass) for child safety.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Dan Anderson:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Schematic Design:</strong> Confirmed project is still in schematic design, with interior partitioning and exterior facades still being coordinated.</li>
<li><strong>Height:</strong> Acknowledged economic drivers for 12-story height (efficiency, construction costs) and appreciated the double-height structure for scale reduction.</li>
<li><strong>Questions:</strong><ul>
<li>Requested designation of Type 2 (handicap accessible) units and their distribution.</li>
<li>Requested layout of mass timber structural grid.</li>
<li>Confirmed economics as driver for no below-grade floor.</li>
<li><strong>Applicant Response (Jason Forney):</strong> Confirmed economics as primary driver for no basement. Previous design with two parking spaces took up half the site for maneuvering, leading to zero parking. Confirmed Type 2 units and structural grid are being worked on for next presentation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Ted Cohen:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Facade Details:</strong> Requested more detail on north facade (trash room) and west facade (garage doors), suggesting a well-designed grill like on Kennedy Street.</li>
<li><strong>Bike Room Access:</strong> Questioned access through lobby for ground floor bike room; suggested rear access.</li>
<li><strong>Russell Apartments Abutment:</strong> Interested in window placement for units abutting Russell Apartments (bedrooms, light).</li>
<li><strong>Height Justification:</strong> Stated that increased affordable units justify additional height.</li>
<li><strong>Applicant Response (Jason Forney):</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Bike Room Access:</strong> Original idea was through lobby; will explore second external access and wider corridor. Second floor bike access via elevator.</li>
<li><strong>Facade Details:</strong> Acknowledged need for more detail on ground floor facade, will look at suggested grill.</li>
<li><strong>Russell Apartments Abutment:</strong> Working on intersection of structure, unit plan, and fenestration for east facade. Distance from property line: 6 inches at ground, 3-5 feet higher up depending on fenestration. Russell building is also close to property line.</li>
<li><strong>Height:</strong> Jason Core reiterated that the increased height is driven by the desire for more affordable units to address the housing crisis.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Carolyn Zern:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Pedestrian Experience:</strong> Echoed concerns about Mass Ave/Walden Street pedestrian experience.</li>
<li><strong>Short-Term Bike Parking:</strong> Questioned only one short-term space; asked about Blue Bike stations and incorporating more short-term parking for visitors/deliveries.</li>
<li><strong>Applicant Response (Sean Hope):</strong> Worked with bike parking department; site constraints limit on-site short-term parking. Committed to working with a Blue Bike station. Will explore public way options during Mass Ave renovations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Chair Mary Flynn:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Elevators/Stairs:</strong> Confirmed two elevators and two stairwells.</li>
<li><strong>Grilling:</strong> No outdoor grilling planned; indoor amenity space may have kitchenette.</li>
<li><strong>Laundry Room:</strong> Questioned number of machines for building size.</li>
<li><strong>Applicant Response (Jason Forney):</strong> Building code governs minimum number of laundry machines (1 per 10 units); will review.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Board Member Comments (General):</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Mass Ave/Walden Street:</strong> Strong desire for more detail on ground floor facades, pedestrian experience, and integration with North Mass Ave planning vision. Request for city staff to clarify city's vision for public realm space.</li>
<li><strong>Rooftop Garden:</strong> Request for sections to understand plant sizes (trees vs. shrubs), shade protection.</li>
<li><strong>City Parking Lot:</strong> Curiosity about future plans for the city-owned surface parking lot and its potential use for deliveries/ride-share.</li>
<li><strong>Facade Design:</strong> Appreciation for double-height framing and sleek, modern look. Suggestions for more detail, recesses for private outdoor space, and exploring more openings on east/west facades.</li>
<li><strong>Ground Floor Height:</strong> Suggestion to increase ground floor height for better proportion and potential transformer clearance.</li>
<li><strong>Bike Parking:</strong> Concern about second-floor bike parking taking up potential residential unit space; suggestion for half-basement for bike parking.</li>
<li><strong>Laundry Room Location:</strong> Questioned top-floor location; suggested it could be in basement to free up top-floor space for another unit.</li>
<li><strong>Fossil Fuels/Generators:</strong> Suggestion to explore ways to eliminate rooftop emergency generator and fuel storage.</li>
<li><strong>Linden Tree:</strong> Concern about the linden tree next to Russell Apartments; requested clear plan for its preservation and visual impact on neighbors. Applicant stated a master arborist report confirms viability of saving the tree with specific methodology.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Staff Comments (Eric Thorgoldsen):</strong><ul>
