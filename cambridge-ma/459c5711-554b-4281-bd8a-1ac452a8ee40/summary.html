    *   Councillor Nolan noted the doubling of applications for existing residential uses and the discrepancy between applications and issued permits. She inquired if this was due to staff overwhelm, withdrawals, or future issuance.

    *   Councillor Nolan inquired about the number of units expected to be built in new proposals, emphasizing the goal of more units and affordability.

    *   Councillor Zusy asked about tracking foreign investors and the number of units in the pipeline. Mr. Lozaro confirmed this data is not collected on permit applications.
    *   Councillor Azeem stated that permitting data can be misleading and that actual construction numbers are likely smaller than permit applications. He suggested that developers are waiting for interest rates to change.
