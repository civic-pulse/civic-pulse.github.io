*   <strong>Former Councilor Toomey:</strong> Spoke on the Eastern Cambridge Community Enhancement Zoning Petition, urging the Council to adopt the original letter of commitment and language for final ordination.
*   <strong>School Committee Member Fred Fantini:</strong> Supported the zoning change for the BioMed project at 320 Charles Street and the mitigation funds for the East End House, highlighting the East End House's long history and current facility needs. He also advocated for a city-wide plan to support non-profits' capital needs.
*   <strong>Suzanne Blier (Five Fuller Place):</strong> Urged support for neighborhood conservation districts and historic building guidelines. She expressed concern about the upzoning not reducing housing prices and advocated for building for low-income individuals rather than relying on market solutions. She criticized the city's housing report as "pseudoscience covering for gentrification policies."
*   <strong>Zion Sharon (401 Washington Street):</strong> Supported Policy Order 5 and asked the Council to consider the resources required for upzoning (signage, sewage) and its impact on residents and the city's character. Stated, "building up doesn't make things more affordable, at least not by itself. Otherwise, Manhattan would be the cheapest place to live."

*   <strong>Tina Alou (Director, CEOC, 113.5 Pleasant Street):</strong> Expressed concern about the lack of community process and confusion surrounding the BioMed deal. CEOC declined a $500,000 allocation to allow it to be part of a larger, more equitably distributed fund.

*   <strong>Daniel Seaborg (North Cambridge Partners, 2400 Mass Ave):</strong> Supported lowering the inclusionary zoning threshold from 20% to 10% to make housing projects financially viable. Stated, "Right now at 20%, we're building 20% of nothing, which is no affordable units."
*   <strong>Patrick Barrett:</strong> Advocated for addressing inclusionary zoning, stating that the 20% requirement is hindering housing production.
