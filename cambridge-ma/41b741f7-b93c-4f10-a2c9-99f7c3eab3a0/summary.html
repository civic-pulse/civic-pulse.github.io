<h3 id="iv-public-comment">IV. Public Comment</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>David Sullivan (16 Notre Dame Avenue, North Cambridge):</strong> Supported Policy Order #2 to strengthen non-cooperation with ICE, citing concerns about ICE's actions and a loophole in the current Welcoming Community Ordinance that allows Cambridge police to assist ICE with "support services, crowd control, and even police escort." He stated, "The only role for Cambridge police should be to protect public safety, not to protect ICE agents from the public."</li>
<li><strong>Mark Boswell (105 Walden Street, Cambridge, Neighborhood 9):</strong> Supported Policy Order #4 regarding Alewife Linear Park and Wesley Avenue Access, advocating for an opening at Wesley Avenue to improve usability and connectivity for residents.</li>
<li><strong>Leslie Garvey (203 Lakeview Ave):</strong> Opposed the opening of Wesley Avenue to Linear Park, citing concerns about process, danger, and lack of need. She highlighted previous community engagement that resulted in the current design and stated, "Have you been to Wesley Abb? It's a very small dead end street. There was once a small hole opening in it. It was closed because of all the problems."</li>
<li><strong>Julia Schlossman (41 Walker Street):</strong> Supported Policy Order #2, emphasizing the need to amend the Welcoming Community Ordinance to eliminate the loophole allowing police assistance to ICE. She stated, "Cantabrigians should not be deporting Cantabrigians."</li>
<li><strong>Marilee Meyer (10 Dana Street):</strong> Expressed concern about the unintended consequences of multifamily zoning on the Dover Amendment exemption, particularly regarding a religious organization seeking to expand in residential C1 zoning. She questioned the application of new residential multifamily zoning to educational and religious entities.</li>
<li><strong>Kashif Hoda (440 Cambridge Street):</strong> Supported Policy Order #2, sharing personal fear as an immigrant and advocating for local police to verify the identity of masked and armed individuals claiming to be ICE agents. He stated, "We want local police to come to the scene and check the idea of masked and armed men to verify actually they are ICE agents."</li>
<li><strong>Darren Buck (44 Magoon Street):</strong> Supported Policy Order #82 (Policy Order #4 in the agenda), advocating for opening access from the Linear Park trail to Wesley Avenue for safe walking and biking routes to Peabody Elementary. He stated, "As a former transportation planner, I believe in public space of all kinds. And if you're going to exclude people from public space, you have to have a very good reason."</li>
<li><strong>Rebecca Listfield (66 Harvey Street):</strong> Supported Policy Order #4, stating that a connection at Wesley Avenue would "greatly improve my and my kids' ability to safely and easily access the linear park and the Somerville community path."</li>
<li><strong>Nicholas Fernandez (18 George Street, North Cambridge):</strong> Supported removing the fence on Wesley Avenue, emphasizing the need for easier and safer access for residents.</li>

<li><strong>Young Kim (17 Norris Street):</strong> Urged the Council not to adopt the FY26 budget until a clean version incorporating all amendments and clerical edits is submitted, citing a $50 million inconsistency in the Mass Avenue project appropriation.</li>
<li><strong>Jason Targoff (Cambridge Youth Soccer):</strong> Supported the Ahern Field investment, drawing parallels to the success of turf fields at Russell and Danahy, stating, "It's an investment in the community and it will pay off the way it has paid off at Russell and Danahy."</li>
<li><strong>Scott Kilcoyne (Pemberton Street, North Cambridge):</strong> Supported opening the Linear Path at Wesley Avenue, emphasizing improved safety and access for pedestrians and cyclists.</li>

<li><strong>Richard Fryerman (39 RC Kelly Street):</strong> Supported opening the connection between Wesley Avenue and Linear Park, advocating for expanded access to public resources. He also supported the budget considerations for Ahern Field.</li>
<li><strong>David Bass (23 Norris Street):</strong> Supported Policy Order #4, arguing that the fence at Wesley Avenue is a solution to a 30-year-old problem that no longer exists and hinders access for North Cambridge residents.</li>
<li><strong>Tim Russell (69 Harvey Street):</strong> Supported adding an access path at Wesley Avenue, citing personal experience and the need to connect the community.</li>
<li><strong>Henry Wardus (106 Berkshire Street, Our Revolution in Cambridge):</strong> Strongly supported Policy Order #2 to update the Welcoming Community Ordinance, stating it would "make Cambridge a safer city."</li>
