<h3 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h3>
<p>The Cambridge City Council convened a special meeting to address the critical situation at 221 Mount Auburn Street. The primary agenda item was a request from the City Manager for a <strong>$20 million appropriation</strong> to fund the demolition of the structurally compromised building, which poses a significant public safety risk. Public comments highlighted the tragic impact on residents and concerns about increased traffic in surrounding neighborhoods. The Council ultimately approved the appropriation, with city staff outlining the legal framework for cost recovery from the property owners.</p>

<h4 id="1-discussion-and-vote-on-appropriation-for-221-mount-auburn-street-demolition">1. Discussion and Vote on Appropriation for 221 Mount Auburn Street Demolition</h4>
<p><strong>City Manager's Agenda Item Number:</strong> 2025 Number 186</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Transmitting communication from City Manager Yi-An Huang, relative to the appropriation of $20 million from the General Fund Employee Benefits Department, Salary and Wages account to the General Fund Reserve Department Extraordinary Expenditure account to fund expenses relative to the demolition of 221 Mount Auburn Street.</p>
<p><strong>Key Discussion Points:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Background of the Issue:</strong><ul>
<li>In 2023, Riverview Condos initiated roof replacement and drainage improvements, uncovering unexpected conditions in balconies.</li>
<li>Investigations by SGH, a reputable engineering firm, revealed two major construction defects:<ul>
<li>Structural rebar was consistently two inches lower than specified in design drawings.</li>
<li>Concrete strength was found to be 2,000 pounds per square inch (psi) on average, significantly below the specified 3,000 psi.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Initial repair estimates reached <strong>$80 million or more</strong>, but the structural conditions were deemed too compromised for repair.</li>
<li>The building was determined to be at risk of "punching shear" failure, where connections between columns and slabs are potentially dangerous.</li>
<li>The Condo Association, unable to fund demolition, sought city intervention.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>City's Role and Actions:</strong><ul>
<li>The City has been meeting with the Condo Association multiple times a week since early June.</li>
<li>The Inspectional Services Department (ISD) formally notified the board of the public safety and public health situation.</li>
<li>The Board of Survey (comprising the Building Inspector, City Engineer, Fire Chief, and an independent engineer) concurred that the building needs to be demolished.</li>
<li>The City is proceeding under Chapter 143 of the Massachusetts General Laws, which grants authority to abate dangerous situations on private property when owners are unable or unwilling to act.</li>
<li>This is not an eminent domain taking; the city will not own the property.</li>
<li>The City plans to file a court case to confirm its authority before demolition.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Demolition Challenges and Costs:</strong><ul>
<li>The <strong>$20 million appropriation</strong> is considered a conservative estimate due to significant unknowns.</li>
<li>The demolition is complex:<ul>
<li>Traditional demolition methods are not feasible due to the building's condition.</li>
<li>All material will be treated as hazardous due to asbestos in almost all units, increasing disposal costs by <strong>five to ten times</strong>.</li>
<li>Significant engineering, planning, and permitting (through DEP) are required.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The goal is to have demolition "significantly underway" before snowfall to reduce risk from additional weight.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Cost Recovery Mechanism:</strong><ul>
<li>The costs associated with demolition will become a debt owed to the city by the property owners.</li>
<li>If unpaid, the city can record a statement of debt at the Registry of Deeds, creating a lien on the property with the same priority as a tax lien.</li>
<li>The city can force a sale of the property to recover funds if the debt remains unpaid.</li>
<li>The Condo Association plans a "partition action" in land court to dissolve the association and convert ownership to tenants in common, a process anticipated to take at least a year. The city will monitor this process to ensure proper lien placement.</li>
<li>The estimated value of the land is believed to be in excess of <strong>$20 million</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Funding Source for Appropriation:</strong><ul>
<li>The <strong>$20 million</strong> will be temporarily transferred from the General Fund Employee Benefits Department, Salary and Wages account.</li>
<li>This is a temporary measure because the city's free cash amount for the fiscal year is not yet certified by the state (expected late September/early October).</li>
<li>Once free cash is certified, the City Council will be asked to approve a free cash appropriation to replenish the employee benefits account.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Community Engagement:</strong><ul>
<li>A website shares relevant documents.</li>
<li>An in-person community meeting was held two weeks prior, and a virtual meeting is scheduled for July 24th.</li>
<li>Staff have met with abutters to share information and answer questions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Public Comments:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ann Saada (60 Larchwood Drive, Cambridge; formerly 221 Mount Auburn Street):</strong><ul>
<li>President of the Board of Trustees of the Riverview and Cambridge Condo Trust.</li>
<li>Expressed gratitude to the Mayor and Council for addressing the complex situation.</li>
<li>Confirmed the building's risk of uncontrolled collapse and the Condo Association's inability to fund demolition.</li>
<li>Highlighted the demographic of Riverview residents as an "naturally occurring retirement community," with many elderly, often single or widowed, facing significant health difficulties and the loss of their main asset.</li>
<li>Acknowledged the city's focus on public safety and the understanding that demolition costs will be recovered from condo owners.</li>
<li>"As citizens, we're grateful to be living in a city that puts public health and safety first and finds concrete and immediate ways to address complex challenges. As incidental beneficiaries, we're grateful to be living in a municipality that can organize positive sum solutions, solutions where everyone comes out ahead."</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Jayden Rowerdink (Four Longfellow Road, Cambridge):</strong><ul>
<li>Expressed concern about increased traffic and speeding on detour routes (Rattle and nearby streets) due to the Mount Auburn Street closure.</li>
<li>Noted speeds of <strong>40-50 mph in 25 mph zones</strong>, creating danger for pedestrians, cyclists, and families.</li>
<li>Requested temporary speeding cameras, increased fines, and weekly updates on safety measures for detour routes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Harriet Griesinger (11 Granville Road #1, Cambridge; formerly 221 Mount Auburn Street):</strong><ul>
<li>Member of the Board of Trustees of Riverview and Cambridge Condominium Trust.</li>
<li>Reiterated the building's weakness, risk of collapse, proximity to other homes, and presence of asbestos.</li>
<li>Emphasized that owners, many of whom are elderly (e.g., 85 years old), cannot afford demolition.</li>
<li>Acknowledged that the appropriation means costs will be recovered from owners via large charges on tax bills, paid before any sale proceeds.</li>
<li>"I understand what the proposed allocation of money means to the Cambridge taxpayer. I have been one for a long time. I moved here in 1968 after two years after getting a job in Cambridge, and I've been a taxpaying property owner since 1971."</li>
