<h4 id="c-city-manager-agenda-item-number-5-report-on-mass-general-law-chapter-40u">C. City Manager Agenda Item Number 5: Report on Mass General Law Chapter 40U</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Communication:</strong> Transmitted from Yi-An Huang, City Manager, relative to a waiting report item number 25-05 regarding a report on the use of Mass General Law chapter 40U to determine which local statutes can be enforced by the local option procedure in order to better collect fines in violation of Cambridge ordinances.</li>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li>Councilor Nolan thanked the staff for the comprehensive report, highlighting the difficulty in collecting fines and enforcing laws. She noted Chapter 40U's potential for enforcing public health and safety violations (short-term rentals, dumpsters, rodents, snow/ice removal, litter, tenant rights).</li>
<li>City Solicitor Sean McKendree, DPW Commissioner John Nardone, Deputy Commissioner Jennifer Matthews, and ISD Deputy Commissioner Jacob Lazaro were present to discuss the report.</li>
<li>City Solicitor McKendree suggested further discussion at a committee meeting to detail pros and cons, coordination among departments, and ordinance changes.</li>
<li>Deputy Commissioner Matthews explained that ordinance changes would be needed for snow/ice removal standards and procedures around payment. She emphasized focusing on engagement and remedying offenses before fines.</li>
<li>Vice Mayor McGovern inquired about the extent of the problem and whether it was revenue-driven. City Solicitor McKendree clarified that fines are for compliance, and the current process (Chapter 40, Section 21D) is cumbersome. Chapter 40U offers a more modern enforcement scheme with internal appeals and additional penalties for unpaid tickets.</li>
<li>Deputy Commissioner Lazaro noted that ISD's enforcement primarily involves face-to-face interaction and warning letters, with fines as a last resort.</li>
<li>Councilor Zusy suggested referring the matter to the Ordinance Committee or Finance Committee. The Council agreed to refer it to the Finance Committee.</li>

</li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="a-committee-report-number-1-combined-sewer-overflows-csos">A. Committee Report Number 1: Combined Sewer Overflows (CSOs)</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Report:</strong> That the City Manager is requested to work with relevant city departments and the recently formed coalition to consider options, including consideration of costs and benefits, to meet a 2050 25-year storm level of control, update regulations for private development of stormwater, use of green infrastructure, and improved meaningful public outreach regarding ongoing sewer and stormwater investment, including the creation of a combined sewer overflow commission. (From a meeting of September 9, 2025).</li>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li>Councilor Nolan explained that the policy order resulted from a Health and Environment Committee meeting with watershed associations and city staff.

<h4 id="b-committee-report-number-3-solar-panel-protection">B. Committee Report Number 3: Solar Panel Protection</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Report:</strong> That the City Manager is requested to work with the Community Development Department to draft zoning language based on the proposed recommendations, review the feasibility of the proposed recommendations with developers, and consider the possibility of having AHO construction be exempt from the proposed zoning.</li>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li>Councilor Nolan explained that the policy order came from a Health and Environment Committee meeting on September 16th. It addresses solar radiation impacts of taller buildings on lower building heights and seeks to create a 20-foot separation standard at the height of solar panels. She supported the compromise approach.</li>
<li>Councilor Zusy proposed an <strong>amendment by substitution</strong> to request more data before drafting zoning language. She argued that the assumption of 45-foot average height for solar installations might be inaccurate, and requested data on:<ul>
<li>Average height of residential rooftop solar arrays (bell curve, raw data).</li>
<li>Average age of existing residential rooftop solar arrays (bell curve).</li>
<li>Output in megawatts of existing solar arrays (residential, commercial, municipal).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Councilor Azeem exercised his <strong>charter right</strong> on this item.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li>Vice Mayor McGovern, as lead sponsor, explained the need to update the city seal, noting outdated elements and the desire for a more inclusive representation of Cambridge. He suggested the committee could set parameters for a potential competition.</li>
