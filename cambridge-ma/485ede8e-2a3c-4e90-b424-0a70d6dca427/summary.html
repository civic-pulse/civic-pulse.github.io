He emphasized the city's role in fighting for these values while focusing on local issues like affordable housing, parks, and transportation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Councilor Nolan:</strong> Inquired about financial impact on grants.<ul>
<li><strong>City Manager Huang:</strong> No immediate impacts on grants, but long shutdown could affect federal grants. Largest impact would be on initiatives depending on federal agency support (e.g., transportation, EPA).</li>

<li><strong>Vote:</strong> 8 Yes, 1 Absent (Mayor Simmons). <strong>Motion Passed.</strong></li>

<h4 id="b-city-manager-agenda-item-2-preservation-restriction-at-44-jfk-street">B. City Manager Agenda Item #2: Preservation Restriction at 44 JFK Street</h4>

<h4 id="c-city-manager-agenda-item-5-report-on-mass-general-law-chapter-40u">C. City Manager Agenda Item #5: Report on Mass General Law Chapter 40U</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Communication:</strong> From City Manager Yi-An Huang relative to a waiting report item #25-05 regarding the use of Mass General Law Chapter 40U for enforcing local statutes and collecting fines.</li>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Councilor Nolan:</strong> Thanked staff for the comprehensive report. Explained the policy order's intent to address difficulties in collecting fines and enforcing laws, particularly for public health and safety violations (short-term rentals, dumpsters, rodents, snow/ice removal, litter, tenant rights). Inquired about next steps for adoption and potential staff burden.<ul>
<li><strong>City Solicitor Sean McKendree:</strong> Suggested further discussion at a committee meeting. Noted coordination among departments, staffing, and ordinance changes (e.g., snow/ice removal standards, fee schedule) would be needed.</li>
<li><strong>Deputy City Manager Kathy Watkins:</strong> Explained that 40U would require ordinance changes for snow/ice removal and procedures around payment. Emphasized focusing on engagement and remedying underlying offenses before fines. Noted the need for transparency in enforcement ordinances.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Wilson:</strong> Inquired about the severity of the problem and whether it's revenue-driven or compliance-driven.<ul>
<li><strong>City Solicitor Sean McKendree:</strong> Explained that tickets are for compliance, not revenue. The current process (Chapter 40, Section 21D) is cumbersome. Chapter 40U is a more modern enforcement scheme for specific violations (short-term rentals, housing/sanitary codes, snow/ice removal), allowing internal appeals and additional penalties for unpaid tickets.</li>
<li><strong>Deputy Commissioner Jacob Lazaro (Inspectional Services Department):</strong> Stated that ISD enforcement primarily uses face-to-face interaction and warning letters, with tickets as a last resort. Noted some unpaid fines, mostly related to temporary dumpsters.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Zusy:</strong> Inquired about the appropriate committee for further discussion.<ul>
<li><strong>City Solicitor Sean McKendree:</strong> Suggested either Ordinance Committee or Finance Committee (both committees of the whole) for initial discussion before drafting concrete ordinance language.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Vice Mayor McGovern:</strong> Suggested referring to the Finance Committee first.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Motion:</strong> To place the report on file and refer to the Finance Committee.</li>
<li><strong>Vote:</strong> 8 Yes, 1 Absent (Mayor Simmons). <strong>Motion Passed.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ix-committee-reports">IX. Committee Reports</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Motion:</strong> By Councilor Nolan to move suspension of the rules to bring forward Committee Reports #1 and #3.</li>
<li><strong>Vote:</strong> 8 Yes, 1 Absent (Mayor Simmons). <strong>Motion Passed.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="a-committee-report-1-combined-sewer-overflows-csos">A. Committee Report #1: Combined Sewer Overflows (CSOs)</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Report:</strong> That the City Manager is requested to work with relevant city departments and the recently formed coalition to consider options, including costs and benefits, to meet a 2050 25-year storm level of control, update regulations for private development of stormwater, use of green infrastructure, and improved public outreach regarding ongoing sewer and stormwater investment, including the creation of a combined sewer overflow commission. (From a meeting of September 9, 2025).</li>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Councilor Nolan:</strong> Explained the policy order's origin from a Health and Environment Committee meeting. Thanked watershed associations and city staff. Highlighted the request for a clear cost-benefit analysis of the 2050 25-year storm CSO option, stormwater mitigation, and improved public input, including a public body to meet with advocates.<ul>
<li><strong>Deputy City Manager Kathy Watkins:</strong> Acknowledged the complexity and expense of the CSO program. Welcomed an ongoing working group or committee for healthy conversation, outreach, and education, especially with the draft CSO plan due at year-end.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Toner:</strong> Thanked Deputy City Manager Watkins for her work on the issue, acknowledging its complexity and the city's efforts.</li>
<li><strong>Vice Mayor McGovern:</strong> Supported the policy order, recognizing the complexity but also the urgency of the issue.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Vote:</strong> 8 Yes, 1 Absent (Mayor Simmons). <strong>Motion Passed.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="b-committee-report-3-solar-panel-protection">B. Committee Report #3: Solar Panel Protection</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Report:</strong> That the City Manager is requested to work with the Community Development Department to draft zoning language based on proposed recommendations, review the feasibility of the proposed recommendations with developers, and consider the possibility of having AHO construction be exempt from the proposed zoning.</li>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Councilor Nolan:</strong> Explained the policy order's origin from a Health and Environment Committee meeting (September 16th). Noted the recommendations were developed from an analysis of solar radiation impacts of taller buildings on lower building heights, seeking a 20-foot separation standard at solar panel height. Supported the compromise approach.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Zusy:</strong> Proposed an <strong>amendment by substitution</strong> to the policy order.<ul>
<li><strong>Rationale:</strong> Believed the assumption of average solar system height (40-45 feet) in Professor Harris's study was inaccurate, suggesting 25-30 feet is more common. Requested more data before drafting zoning language to ensure effective protection of existing solar arrays.</li>
<li><strong>Requested Data:</strong><ul>
<li>Average height of residential rooftop solar arrays (bell curve, raw data).</li>
<li>Average age of existing residential rooftop solar arrays (bell curve).</li>
<li>Output in megawatts of existing solar arrays (residential, commercial, municipal).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Azeem:</strong> Exercised his <strong>charter right</strong> on the item.</li>
</ul>
</li>

</ul>
<h4 id="a-policy-order-1-city-seal-review-committee">A. Policy Order #1: City Seal Review Committee</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Order:</strong> That the City Manager is requested to work with the City Council to establish a seal review committee with the charge of recommending an updated city seal and motto in time for adoption prior to the 400th anniversary of the City of Cambridge in 2030.</li>
<li><strong>Sponsors:</strong> Vice Mayor McGovern, Mayor Simmons.</li>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Vice Mayor McGovern:</strong> As lead sponsor, explained the intent to update the seal, noting outdated elements (Gore Hall, Washington Elm) and the need for a more inclusive representation of Cambridge beyond Harvard. Suggested the committee would set parameters for a potential competition.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Zusy:</strong> Supported the idea of a better seal but also appreciated the current one. Suggested an open competition with artists, graphic designers, and students for new designs, believing it might be more effective than a committee.</li>
<li><strong>Vice Mayor McGovern:</strong> Acknowledged the competition idea but suggested a committee could first set parameters, referencing the state-level seal discussion.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Motion:</strong> By Councilor Wilson to adopt Policy Order #1.</li>
<li><strong>Vote:</strong> 8 Yes, 1 Absent (Mayor Simmons). <strong>Motion Passed.</strong></li>
</ul>

<li><strong>Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Councilor Sobrinho-Wheeler:</strong> Thanked co-sponsors and Rep. Mike Connolly. Emphasized social housing as a paradigm shift towards housing as a human right, returning to mixed-income public housing roots, and using revenue from higher-income units to cross-subsidize lower-income units or build more affordable housing. Noted its prevalence in Europe and other US cities. Proposed a Housing Committee meeting with experts as the next step.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Siddiqui:</strong> Supported further discussion with experts, emphasizing the importance of exploring all tools for housing given federal government actions.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Wilson:</strong> Supported the innovative concept of social housing, highlighting its potential for diversity, shared experience, and quality of life.</li>
<li><strong>Vice Mayor McGovern:</strong> Thanked the Cambridge Housing Justice Coalition and Councilor Sobrinho-Wheeler. Emphasized social housing as another tool to address the housing crisis, building on Cambridge's leadership in affordable housing.<ul>
<li><strong>Vice Mayor McGovern (Proposed Amendment):</strong> Suggested amending the order to state that the Housing Committee hold a public meeting prior to the end of calendar year 2025, and that CDD report back with recommendations by the end of March 2026, to set realistic expectations for staff.</li>

</li>

<li><strong>Councilor Azeem:</strong> Requested to be added as a co-sponsor.

</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Amendment:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Motion:</strong> To amend the order to state: "That the Housing Committee hold a public meeting to discuss social housing prior to the end of calendar year 2025, with a report back from Community Development by the end of March 2026."</li>
<li><strong>Co-sponsors added:</strong> Councilor Nolan, Councilor Azeem.</li>

<h4 id="a-charter-right-item-1-mbta-tunnel-in-harvard-square">A. Charter Right Item #1: MBTA Tunnel in Harvard Square</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Communication:</strong> From City Manager Yi-An Huang relative to a waiting report, item #25-32, regarding a request that the city engage in discussions with leadership from the MassBay Transportation Authority (MBTA) and the Harvard Square Business Association (HSBA) regarding a proposal to explore the feasibility of repurposing the long-abandoned MBTA tunnel in Harvard Square into a commercial or cultural space.</li>
<li><strong>Charter Right Exercised By:</strong> Councilor Azeem on September 15, 2025.</li>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Councilor Azeem:</strong> Requested an update from the City Manager.</li>
<li><strong>City Manager Huang:</strong><ul>
<li>Continued conversations with MBTA, who owns the tunnel.</li>
<li>MBTA is favorably inclined to explore an RFP, but the process is complex and requires close collaboration.</li>
<li>Second piece: Need for budget commitment for a Phase 1 feasibility study ($500,000 - $1 million), to be weighed against other FY27 budget priorities.</li>
<li>Third piece: Even with aggressive timelines, the tunnel would likely come online in 5-10 years, urging consideration of nearer-term initiatives for commercial districts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Azeem:</strong> Made a motion to place on file.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Nolan:</strong> Supported the City Manager's memo. Stated that no funds should be committed until MBTA is fully on board. Advocated for nearer-term pedestrianization efforts in Harvard Square as a quicker, less costly solution.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Zusy:</strong> Inquired if HSBA could issue the RFP or if an entertainment company could fund the feasibility study.<ul>
<li><strong>Deputy City Manager Kathy Watkins:</strong> Clarified that HSBA sought partners to draft the RFP scope. The $72,000 was for homework to understand what a real RFP would look like. Noted the complexity of working with MBTA due to its infrastructure, operational priorities, and multiple review groups.</li>
<li><strong>City Manager Huang:</strong> Explained challenges of private funding due to MBTA ownership and the need for a public bidding process. Highlighted legal, regulatory, and policy prioritization challenges with MBTA, and the possibility of MBTA needing the space in the future.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Vice Mayor McGovern:</strong> Emphasized the need to get started on exploring the tunnel's potential despite complexities, referencing the long abandonment of the tunnels.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Wilson:</strong> Agreed on the need to invest to make an informed decision, suggesting allocating the $72,000 already reserved for related purposes. Noted excitement from key stakeholders during a recent tour.</li>
