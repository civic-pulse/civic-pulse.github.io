<h4 id="a-cambridge-department-of-public-works-dpw-and-cambridge-water-department">A. Cambridge Department of Public Works (DPW) and Cambridge Water Department</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Presenters:</strong> Kathy Watkins (Commissioner of Public Works), Rich Holley (Manager of Distribution, Water Department).</li>
<li><strong>DPW Presentation Highlights (Kathy Watkins):</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Holistic Approach:</strong> DPW employs a 5-year and 10-year plan for utilities, focusing on complete streets, Vision Zero, and public safety.</li>
<li><strong>Sidewalk Inventory:</strong> Updated inventory of all city sidewalks, pedestrian ramps, and crosswalks.<ul>
<li><strong>Condition Assessment:</strong> 43% good, 49% fair, 7% poor.</li>
<li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Over 3,000 non-compliant ramps (too steep, lacking truncated domes). Plans for contracts to address ramp compliance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Pavement Management System:</strong> Updated system scores every roadway (0-100) to prioritize projects.</li>
<li><strong>Sewer and Drain System (10-year plan):</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Drainage Areas:</strong> Left of dark blue line (eastern part of city) drains to Alewife Brook; right side drains to Charles River.</li>
<li><strong>Combined vs. Separated Sewers:</strong> Blue areas are separated (better); yellow areas are not separated.</li>
<li><strong>Combined Sewer Overflows (CSOs):</strong><ul>
<li>Combined sewers carry both rain and sewage. Heavy rain can overwhelm pipes, leading to CSOs into Charles River or Alewife Brook.</li>
<li>Significant reduction in overflows: 85% into Alewife Brook, 98% into Charles River over 30 years.</li>
<li><strong>CSO Control Plan:</strong> Ongoing project with Somerville and MWRA.<ul>
<li>Next community meeting: Fall 2025.</li>
<li>Draft plan: End of 2025.</li>
<li>Finalized plan: January 2027.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Climate Change Integration:</strong> First CSO control plan in the country to effectively incorporate climate change, accounting for increased precipitation intensity.</li>
<li><strong>Strategies:</strong> Sewer separation, green stormwater infrastructure, inflow/infiltration reduction, storage facilities (e.g., large storage tunnels), and conveyance improvements.</li>
<li><strong>Project Examples:</strong><ul>
<li>Tobin School: 100,000-gallon bio-retention area and 1.25 million-gallon stormwater tank under construction to reduce flooding.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Sea Level Rise and Storm Surge:</strong> Regional project with other communities to enhance Charles River Dam and Amelia Earhart Dam to prevent seawater intrusion.<ul>
<li>Flooding from sea level rise can be 2-4 feet higher than rainfall flooding, significantly impacting development.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Electrical Division:</strong> Moved into DPW a year ago, providing more support and funding.<ul>
<li><strong>Projects:</strong> Replacement of decorative poles at Lechmere Canal Park (Shepherd's Crook style), 3-4 year plan for light pole replacement, maintenance of PV systems at city buildings.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Water Department Presentation Highlights (Rich Holley):</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Water Main Replacement Rationale:</strong><ul>
<li>Aging infrastructure (some mains date to 1864).</li>
<li>Leakage history and water conservation.</li>
<li>Maintaining fire flows (Cambridge has high percentage of active fire hydrants).</li>
<li>Improving water quality (preventing stagnant water).</li>
<li>Supporting current and future development.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Coordination with DPW:</strong> Water main replacements are coordinated with DPW street and sidewalk reconstruction projects to avoid future breaks on new infrastructure.</li>
<li><strong>Current Projects (Chapter 90 Contract 25):</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Maple Ave (2018, in-house):</strong> 1,500 ft of 8-inch ductile iron pipe installed. Fire flows increased from 900 GPM to 1,900 GPM. 10 lead services replaced.</li>
<li><strong>Montgomery Street (2017, in-house):</strong> Transferred water services from old 6-inch cast iron (1870) to 12-inch cleaned and lined main (1933). Fire flows increased from 965 GPM to 1,600 GPM. 7 lead services replaced.</li>
<li><strong>Dana Street (Newport Construction):</strong> Replacing 10-inch cast iron (1896) with 8-inch ductile iron pipe. Hydraulic modeling showed increased fire flows and water quality due to smoother pipe.</li>
<li><strong>Sharapa Street (Fall start):</strong> Replacing 2,000 ft of 6-inch cast iron (1896) with 8-inch pipe. Fire flows expected to almost triple. 22 lead services to be removed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Mass Ave Partial Construction Project (Bike Lanes):</strong> Replacing old cast iron mains (8-20 inches) at intersections with floating bus stops. 1,900 ft of pipe replacement, increased valving for better isolation.</li>
<li><strong>Future Projects (Chapter 90 Contract 26, possible 2025 start):</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Avon Hill Street (in-house):</strong> Replaced old 6-inch main, significantly increased water flows and pressure at the city's highest point.</li>
<li><strong>Hillside Ave:</strong> 400 ft of 6-inch (1871) to be replaced with 8-inch.</li>
<li><strong>Chetwin Road:</strong> Old 6-inch cast iron to be replaced for shared street project.</li>
<li><strong>Gray Street:</strong> 200 ft of 6-inch to be replaced with 8-inch.</li>
<li><strong>Kirkland Road:</strong> Dead end, old main replacement.</li>
<li><strong>Norfolk Street:</strong> 1,500 ft of old 6-inch to be replaced with 8-inch ductile iron pipe.</li>
<li><strong>Haskell Street (J&amp;J Sacca):</strong> Mass Ave to Rindge Ave section, addressing poor fire flows.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Total Proposed 2025 Replacements:</strong> 1.28 miles of new water main.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Board Questions for DPW/Water Department:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Funding:</strong> Mostly city funding (tax revenue, bonds). State Chapter 90 funds also used. Federal funds pursued for specific projects (e.g., $2.4M grant for Fitchburg Rail Line bike/ped bridge design).</li>
<li><strong>Green Infrastructure Measurement:</strong> City tracks green infrastructure (bio-basins, infiltrating catch basins) through O&amp;M plans and regular inspections for private developments.</li>
<li><strong>Permeability and ADA:</strong> DPW balances ADA requirements with permeability by using larger tree pits, deep paving projects, and pervious brick pavers in non-primary walking surfaces. Infiltrating catch basins are preferred over porous paving due to maintenance issues.</li>
<li><strong>CSO and Backflow:</strong> Kathy Watkins clarified that backflow issues are not directly related to CSOs but can occur when any sewer system is overwhelmed. Lower-level fixtures require backflow devices per plumbing code. The city has seen significantly <em>reduced</em> flooding events over 30 years due to extensive system maintenance and understanding.</li>
<li><strong>Full Stormwater/Sewer Separation:</strong> Full separation is not realistic in a 30-year timeframe due to cost and complexity. The CSO control plan prioritizes projects with the biggest benefits and co-benefits.</li>
<li><strong>Melissa Peters:</strong> Jeff Roberts announced Melissa Peters has been named permanent Assistant City Manager for Community Development.</li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="c-vicinity-energy">C. Vicinity Energy</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Presenters:</strong> Matt O'Malley (Chief Sustainability Officer), Dawn Sylvia (VP for Regional Operations).</li>
<li><strong>Vicinity Energy Presentation Highlights (Matt O'Malley):</strong><ul>
<li><strong>District Energy Overview:</strong> Centralized thermal energy production distributed via underground pipes. Evolved from coal to oil, natural gas, CHP, and now electrification.</li>
<li><strong>Vicinity Operations:</strong> In 12 US cities; Boston/Cambridge is a major market. 26 miles of underground pipe (4.1 miles in Cambridge).</li>
<li><strong>Kendall Square Plant:</strong> Largest energy producing facility locally, houses the largest CHP baseload.</li>
<li><strong>Decarbonization Plan (3-pronged approach):</strong><ol>
<li><strong>Electric Boilers:</strong><ul>
<li>42 MW electric boiler installed and operational in Kendall Square since November 2024.</li>
<li>Direct connection to grid allows wholesale energy procurement, enabling use of renewables and cost-competitive decarbonized product.</li>
<li>Compliant with Birdo (Boston) and Butoh (Cambridge) regulations.</li>
<li>Surplus solar events have allowed more frequent operation than anticipated, lowering emissions and fostering more renewables.</li>
<li>Can go from 0 to 100% load in 10 minutes, allowing "valley surfing" to take advantage of low power prices.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Heat Pumps:</strong><ul>
<li>Water-based heat pump leveraging energy from the Charles River.</li>
<li>Will be the first city-scale heat pump of its kind in an American city.</li>
<li>Coefficient of Performance (COP) of 2.0-2.5 (Gen 1), with Gen 2 potentially exceeding 3.0.</li>
<li>Returns water to Charles River 4-7 degrees cooler.</li>
<li>Supported by HEAT, Charles River Watershed Association, Charles River Conservancy, Conservation Law Foundation.</li>
<li>Will displace a fossil fuel boiler at Kendall station within 6-8 months.</li>
<li>Expected to be fully operational by 2028.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Thermal Storage:</strong><ul>
<li>Farthest out technology, hoped to be operational by end of decade (2029-2030).</li>
<li>Captures wind energy (abundant late at night) by heating hot rocks/substrate.</li>
<li>Shifts peak demand by using stored energy during high-demand times (e.g., 6-8 AM).</li>
<li>Aims to offer decarbonized product at competitive rates and spur renewable development.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Modernization Examples:</strong><ul>
<li>Upgrade and relocation of distribution system near MXD site to enable Eversource substation construction.</li>
<li><strong>585 Kendall:</strong> Interconnection completed within last month; building on schedule to take energy by Spring 2026. Involved moving a gas transfer station and upgrading Vicinity's system.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Board Questions for Vicinity Energy:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Heat Pump Efficiency and Cooling:</strong> The heat pump generates steam (heat only). COP is 2.0-2.5. Vicinity leverages existing distribution system and transmission-level power intake to avoid burdening local distribution. Existing absorption cooling and turbine-driven cooling technologies are on the system. The Charles River's stable temperature range (36-73 degrees F) allows for a higher COP compared to air-source heat pumps.</li>
<li><strong>Fuel Agnostic Future:</strong> Vicinity views electrification as another fuel shift, with future energy sources (e.g., fusion) potentially driving the electricity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
