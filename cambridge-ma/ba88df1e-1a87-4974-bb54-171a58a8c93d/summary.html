<h3 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h3>
<p>The Cambridge Planning Board, in a joint meeting with the Cambridge Redevelopment Authority (CRA) Board, addressed two primary items related to Boston Properties' Kendall Square urban redevelopment area. The Board approved a special permit amendment (PB 294 and PB 315) allowing the sharing of 150 long-term bicycle parking spaces between 88 Ames Street and 325 Main Street, finding it to be a minor amendment. Subsequently, the Board received a design update on the Center Plaza and East-West Connector, part of the MXD zoning district's infill development concept plan (PB 315). Discussions focused on the children's play area design, with the Board providing feedback on two proposed options ("Bird's Nest" and "Beehive"), emphasizing scale, thematic coherence, and integration with the substation's context. The Board also granted an extension of time until December 31, 2025, for a pending major amendment application related to PB 315.</p>

<h4 id="d-cra-staff-introduction">D. CRA Staff Introduction</h4>
<ul>
<li>Tom Evans (CRA) stated that the CRA Board does not need to take an active vote unless there's a significant change.</li>
<li><strong>Background:</strong><ul>
<li>325 Main Street initially had bike parking in the basement and short-term retail parking on the plaza.</li>
<li>Google, a tenant at 325 Main Street, requested more bike parking.</li>
<li>88 Ames Street bike parking has been underutilized.</li>
<li>CRA previously approved revisions to bike parking distribution for 88 Ames and 325 Main, utilizing a shared parking requirement.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="e-proponent-presentation">E. Proponent Presentation</h4>
<ul>
<li>Jeff Lohnberg (BXP) presented, accompanied by Catalina Pidea (BXP).</li>
<li><strong>Project Context:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>PB 294:</strong> Special permit for 88 Ames Street (Proto Apartments), approved 2015, occupied 2018 (280 units).</li>
<li><strong>PB 315:</strong> Infill Development Concept Plan (IDCP), original approval for 145 Broadway. Subsequent amendment included 325 Main Street (approved 2019, occupied 2022). A second amendment included Eversource Substation, 250/290 Binney, and 121 Broadway.</li>
<li>The current request for PB 315 only involves 325 Main Street.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Site Adjacencies:</strong> 88 Ames Street (residential) and 325 Main Street (commercial) are very close. The proposed shared bike shed is within 50 feet of 325 Main Street's entrance.</li>
<li><strong>Existing Bike Parking at 88 Ames Street:</strong><ul>
<li>Total 295 long-term spaces.</li>
<li>150 spaces in a three-level bike shed (54 ground, 48 second, 48 third floor).</li>
<li>113 spaces on the fifth level of the garage (connected to residential building, preferred by residents).</li>
<li>32 spaces within the green garage.</li>
<li>42 additional short-term spaces (primarily on Ames Street).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Utilization Data (88 Ames Street):</strong><ul>
<li>Apartment occupancy: 90%+ since 2019.</li>
<li>Bike parking utilization: Max 48 bikes (18%) out of 295 available spaces.</li>
<li><strong>Reasons for low utilization:</strong> Blue bike stations, T access, residents storing bikes in units.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Requested Changes:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>PB 294 (88 Ames Street):</strong><ul>
<li>Level 5 garage spaces (113) remain 100% for 88 Ames Street.</li>
<li>150 spaces in the three-level bike shed to be shared between Proto and 325 Main Street.</li>
<li>Ground floor of the bike shed to be used for short-term parking for 325 Main Street, open to Proto residents, 325 Main employees, and the public.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>PB 315 (325 Main Street):</strong><ul>
<li>108 long-term bicycle spaces required by zoning.</li>
<li>Requesting that shared spaces in the bike shed (levels 2 and 3) be counted as long-term bike parking for 325 Main Street to maintain zoning compliance.</li>
<li>47 short-term spaces to be located within the ground floor of the bike shed (within 50 feet of 325 Main entrance), replacing previously proposed locations on Main Street, Kendall Plaza, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Goal:</strong> Better utilize existing bike parking facilities and balance demand/supply.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Context:</strong> Previously included a children's play area, which has been moved to the Center Plaza. This update reimagines the connector without the play area.</li>
<li><strong>Timeline:</strong> Part of 121 Broadway design review and approval (2022 IDC Amendment). Delivery tied to 121 Broadway occupancy (Q2/Q3 2027).</li>
<li><strong>Previous Design:</strong> Showed play structures between 105 Broadway and 115 Broadway, connecting to 6th Street Connector and Kitty Knox Bikeway.</li>

<li>Underground stormwater detention system for 115 Broadway (remains).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>New Design:</strong><ul>
<li>Continues crosswalk connection from Center Plaza.</li>
<li>Follows existing path width (approx. 6 feet) to the north of existing trees.</li>
<li>New seating area on the south side of trees (former Turner construction trailer site).</li>
<li>Paving: Different color pavers (precast concrete) to differentiate quiet seating from circulation, matching Center Plaza design. Pervious paving used for tree roots.</li>
<li>Bench seating areas.</li>
<li>New trees (7) on the north side of the path, replacing non-surviving trees. Woody shrubs in planters.</li>

<li><strong>Renderings:</strong> Views from below pedestrian bridge, bird's eye view towards Center Plaza, on connector path looking west.</li>
<li><strong>Material Palette:</strong> Matches Fennel Plaza (yellow books), metal planters, trash receptacles.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="c-staff-comments">C. Staff Comments</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>CRA Staff (Cecilia Cobb &amp; Alex Levering):</strong><ul>
<li>Thanked BXP and design team for responding to feedback.</li>
<li>Changes to Center Plaza moved towards a more cohesive, attractive, welcoming design, providing a different open space experience.</li>
<li>Appreciated changes to nooks, primary walking paths, increased and robust planting (especially near trellis/swing area).</li>
<li>Appreciated accessible walkways and varied seating.</li>
<li><strong>Children's Play Area:</strong> Still feels somewhat unresolved but moving closer to resolution. Goal: iconic character, identity, draw for families.</li>
<li>Appreciated increased play equipment variety, educational play panels (accessibility).</li>
<li>Suggested linking themes (birds/bees) to the substation's impact and narrative (e.g., underground substation vs. environmental elements).</li>
<li>Alex Levering: Suggested reviewing furnishing plans to ensure 290 retail can be a thriving space and activate the plaza.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>CDD Staff (Eric Thorkelson):</strong><ul>
<li>Agreed design continues to improve.</li>
<li>Play area is more interesting, has more identity; no preference between options.</li>
<li>More vegetation, taller (but small) trees are feasible.</li>
<li>Geometry of lawn, paths, and slight bend in diagonal path are much nicer.</li>
<li>Addressed handicapped access, less pavement.</li>
<li><strong>Suggestions for Play Area:</strong> More vegetation, more varied topography, more complex interior side of perimeter (nooks), more play equipment (height, movement), combining structures (like Lincoln Park in Somerville).</li>
<li>Consider adult recreation/exercise equipment.</li>
<li>More vegetation throughout, including plants in containers (e.g., on top of hatch).</li>
<li>More benches, especially on the diagonal path south of the hatch.</li>
<li>Make area between 290 and exhaust tower more inviting/intriguing.</li>
<li><strong>Suggestions for West Side:</strong> More trees behind drop-off area (extend double-wide trees as single line). Trees in containers on sidewalks. Vines on trellises.</li>
<li>Chamfer southeast corner of the beacon to avoid intruding into path.</li>
<li><strong>East-West Connector Comments:</strong> Improved. Consider how ends connect to adjacent areas (Volpe, 6th Street walkway). Coordinate with city for smooth connection.</li>
<li>Additional trees (e.g., northwest corner, south side where no underground storage).</li>
<li>Furniture/benches/trash containers: Should be consistent with other areas (VASA, Volpe Center).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="d-planning-board-discussion">D. Planning Board Discussion</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mary Lydecker:</strong><ul>
<li>Appreciated two play options.</li>
<li>Previous pollinator garden equipment felt "precious" in context of large infrastructure. Play should be sculptural, stand up to intake/exhaust structures.</li>
<li><strong>Preference:</strong> Leans towards "Bird's Nest" due to elements holding up better to scale.</li>
<li>Concerned about themes being too literal/random; suggested play should pull from substation context (e.g., "what's up with the substation down below?").</li>
<li>Referenced Domino Park (NYC) for sculptural, artistic, colorful play.</li>
<li>Referenced Peabody School Playground (Cambridge) for taller, tech-oriented metal/vinyl/netting structures.</li>
<li>Agreed with Eric's idea of undulating edges for play area to create nooks.</li>
<li>Suggested musical elements (Gorick, Danahy Playground).</li>
<li>Praised cant in walkway and increased green space.</li>
<li>Curious about the "deck" feel.</li>
<li><strong>East-West Connector:</strong> Questioned need for so much pathway/seating, preferring more softscape.</li>
<li>Hoped for coherence in site furnishings with Center Plaza.</li>
<li><strong>Planting:</strong> Pallette seemed heavy on perennials, light on woody shrubs (winter appearance). Many "native" plants listed were not truly native (e.g., Chinese witch hazel, barrenwort, Hakonechloa). Suggested consulting ecologist for native/adapted palette, especially for shady corridor.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Ashley Tan:</strong><ul>
<li>Thanked team for efforts to make space interesting despite substation.</li>
<li>Liked increased height of plantings/planters.</li>
<li>Emphasized embracing the substation (educational signage, murals).</li>
<li>Importance of play area scale (not lost in the area).</li>
<li><strong>East-West Connector:</strong> Questioned anticipated bike traffic and safety for pedestrians, given connection to bike path.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Dan Anderson:</strong><ul>
<li>Found project "fantastic," path/nooks a great improvement.</li>
<li>Appreciated planting against the beacon, but still questions about detail of engagement with pavement/planting.</li>
<li>Lighting is critical for both schemes; questions about plaza lighting.</li>
<li>Agreed with Mary on scale; opportunity for sculptural element (large tree with height/volume/motion).</li>
<li>Agreed with Eric on undulating edges for play area (less like a "corral").</li>
<li>Noted previous East-West connector play area had vibrant blues/whites; current schemes feel muted. Suggested more vibrant color.</li>
<li><strong>East-West Connector:</strong> Suggested lower-level lighting under benches. Pushing benches back 18 inches for comfort.</li>
<li>Noted a 50% set with two paths that broke up trees differently, potentially allowing more planting.</li>
<li>Applauded breadth of team's work.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Eric Thorkelson:</strong><ul>
<li>Suggested adding medium-height, spindly trees (e.g., striped maple) in the zone between play area and east drive for scale and visual interest.</li>
<li>Agreed with Mary's comments on thematicism vs. scale.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Carolyn Zern:</strong><ul>
<li>Appreciated work by all teams.</li>
<li><strong>Preference:</strong> Leans towards "Bird's Nest" due to less literal theme, allowing more interpretation/imagination.</li>
