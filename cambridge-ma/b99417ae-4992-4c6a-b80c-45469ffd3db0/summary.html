<li>Concern over dramatic increase in ICE funding in federal budget reconciliation bill (tripled funding for enforcement/deportation).</li>
<li>Supreme Court decision lifting restrictions on federal agents (previously ordered by a California district court) regarding racial profiling and indiscriminate detentions is worrisome.</li>

<li>Vice Mayor McGovern noted that changing the ordinance would be a lengthy process and shouldn't hold up current appointments.</li>
<li>Councilor Zusy expressed continued concern and stated she would abstain from the vote, not due to the individuals' qualifications, but due to the timing relative to Policy Order #5.</li>

<li>Sam Lipson (Senior Director of Environmental Health, Cambridge Public Health Department) explained that the proposal aims to move tobacco/nicotine enforcement to the Board of Health via regulation, allowing for more nimble updates to model code. City Council would retain control over citywide policies (e.g., nicotine-free generation, permit caps).</li>

<li><strong>Discussion:</strong><ul>

<li>Councilor Toner sought clarification on whether the city controls the data and does not share it.</li>
