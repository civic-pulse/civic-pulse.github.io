<p><strong>II. Public Hearing: Zoning Petition to Amend Section 4.60 (Short-Term Rentals)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Petition Overview:</strong> A City Council zoning petition to amend Section 4.60 of the Zoning Ordinance.<ul>
<li><strong>Redefine "short-term rental":</strong> Change from "less than 30 nights" to "less than 28 nights" to align with surrounding municipalities (e.g., Somerville, Boston).</li>
<li><strong>Add definitions:</strong> "Operator-occupied short-term rental," "owner-adjacent short-term rental," and "booking agent."</li>
<li><strong>Add conditions of authorized uses:</strong> Compliance with State Building Code, Fire Code, Sanitary Code, and all other state and local habitability requirements.</li>
<li><strong>Add requirements:</strong> Provide booking information and other documentation to the city upon request.</li>
<li><strong>Add enforcement mechanisms:</strong> For violations of the ordinance or state regulations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>City Staff Presentation (James D'Angelo, Inspectional Services Department):</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Current Situation:</strong><ul>
<li>City uses Granicus Host Compliance to monitor short-term rentals.</li>
<li>As of July 14th, approximately 635 short-term rentals in the city.</li>
<li>Only 175 registered units, leaving approximately 460 unregistered units.</li>
<li>Difficulty in identifying addresses from booking websites (e.g., Airbnb, Vrbo) until after booking.</li>
<li>Host Compliance identifies about 66% of listings.</li>
<li>480 violation letters sent to date, resulting in some units becoming compliant or delisting.</li>
<li>Seasonal variances, with highest numbers in summer and during graduation season.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Breakdown of Registered Units:</strong><ul>
<li>63% are operator-occupied.</li>
<li>37% are owner-adjacent.</li>
<li>Majority (approx. 100 of 175) are in single and two-family houses.</li>
<li>98% of registered units use Airbnb; 14% use Vrbo.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Proposed Changes:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Definition of Short-Term Rental:</strong> Changed to "less than 28 nights" for clarity and consistency with other cities.</li>
<li><strong>Operator-Occupied Short-Term Rental:</strong> If the operator is away for any period, the unit must be rented as a whole to one party (previously 7 consecutive days). Individual bedrooms can only be rented if the operator is present.</li>
<li><strong>Compliance:</strong> All short-term rentals must comply with building, sanitary, fire, and all other state/local occupancy codes.</li>
<li><strong>Transaction Records:</strong> Ability to request transaction records for all units (previously only owner-adjacent).</li>
<li><strong>Booking Agent Fines:</strong> Booking agents or persons accepting fees for ineligible short-term rentals can be fined $300 per day, with each day constituting a separate violation.</li>
<li><strong>Injunctions:</strong> Inspectional Services can seek court injunctions to prohibit offering short-term rentals.</li>
<li><strong>Revocation/Prohibition:</strong> ISD can revoke or prohibit registration for building, zoning, sanitary, or fire code violations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Rationale:</strong> These changes aim to enhance enforcement capabilities, clarify language, and ensure safety, drawing inspiration from ordinances in Somerville, Boston, Springfield, Quincy, New York City, East Providence, and Key West.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Public Comment:</strong><ul>
<li>No public comments were received at the meeting.</li>
<li>Written comments received by 5 p.m. yesterday were from Rachel Plummer, Sarah Block, Maria Fontelio, Ethan Frank, Itamar Turner Trowering, Ben Wergaft, John Frank, Peter Nonberg, Theodora Liv, Brian McNebo, Kathleen Higgins, David Harris, Matt Begedodo, and Joel Bard.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Board Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Tom Sieniewicz:</strong> Asked about the problem the petition is trying to solve, citing concerns about overuse of short-term rentals in other cities.<ul>
<li><strong>Peter McLaughlin (ISD Commissioner):</strong> Emphasized safety concerns (egress, smoke/carbon monoxide detectors) in unregistered units and community impact (parties, noise). Stated current lack of mechanisms to address problematic short-term rentals.</li>
<li><strong>James D'Angelo (ISD):</strong> Added that fining booking agents would disincentivize posting unregistered units and highlighted the integrity of neighborhoods and safety concerns.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Dan Anderson:</strong> Questioned if this is a zoning issue or if state-level regulations exist, and the scope of the problem.<ul>
<li><strong>Elliot Veloso (Law Department):</strong> Explained the disconnect between listed and registered units, and that the amendments provide more enforcement options to encourage registration and compliance with safety codes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Ashley Tan:</strong> Asked if other cities regulate short-term rentals via zoning or a licensing commission.<ul>
<li><strong>Elliot Veloso:</strong> Confirmed Cambridge regulates through zoning, and this is a common approach in other municipalities (e.g., Quincy, Boston) where Inspectional Services is the appropriate department for code enforcement and safety evaluations.</li>
<li><strong>Peter McLaughlin:</strong> Added that state building code mandates periodic inspection of short-term rentals, placing it under building code jurisdiction.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Joy Jackson:</strong> Asked if there's a prerequisite for registration before listing on websites.<ul>
<li><strong>James D'Angelo:</strong> Stated no cross-verification exists; Airbnb might ask for a registration number but doesn't verify it.</li>
<li><strong>Elliot Veloso:</strong> The proposed amendments aim to enable the city to gather information for verification and compliance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Joy Jackson:</strong> Asked if any proposed changes are unique to Cambridge.<ul>
<li><strong>Peter McLaughlin:</strong> Stated no, the changes reflect best practices from other communities.</li>
<li><strong>Elliot Veloso:</strong> Confirmed a close analysis of other communities to ensure legal soundness and avoid challenges.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Dan Anderson:</strong> Asked about city liability if an incident occurred in a registered, inspected unit.<ul>
<li><strong>Elliot Veloso:</strong> Stated that while the city ensures code enforcement, liability for injuries would likely fall on the property owner and potentially the booking platform, not the city.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Ted Cohen:</strong> Strongly recommended adoption, noting the clarity provided for registration and enforcement, and the benefit to neighbors.</li>
<li><strong>Tom Sieniewicz:</strong> Expressed strong endorsement, urging quick action to provide ISD with necessary tools.</li>
<li><strong>Ashley Tan:</strong> Supported the petition, acknowledging the detailed nature but trusting ISD's capacity. Suggested considering a licensing commission if resources become an issue in the future.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Motion:</strong> To recommend that the City Council adopt the zoning petition to amend Section 4.60 regarding short-term rentals.<ul>
<li><strong>Moved:</strong> Tom Sieniewicz</li>
<li><strong>Seconded:</strong> Ted Cohen</li>
<li><strong>Roll Call Vote:</strong><ul>
<li>Ted Cohen: Yes</li>
<li>Mary Lydecker: Yes</li>
<li>Diego Macias: Yes</li>
<li>Tom Sieniewicz: Yes</li>

<p><strong>III. Advisory Design Consultation: Case AHO-8 (28-30 Wendell Street)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Project:</strong> Affordable Housing Overlay project proposed by HRI 30 Wendell LLC.</li>
<li><strong>Proposal:</strong> Construct a new eight-story building with 95 affordable rental units and amenities, 77 long-term and 8 short-term bicycle parking spaces, and a gross floor area of 110,803 square feet.</li>
<li><strong>CDD Staff Introduction (Evan Petrini):</strong><ul>
<li>First of two required Planning Board advisory consultation sessions for an AHO project.</li>
<li>This process now applies to all residential developments at least 50,000 square feet.</li>
<li>AHO projects under 50,000 square feet no longer require two sessions, but those exceeding base zoning height require one session.</li>
<li>Purpose: Provide advisory comments on design and conformance with city urban design objectives/guidelines.</li>
<li>Board will issue an initial report; applicant will return for a second session with an updated design.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Applicant Presentation (Eleni Makrakis, HRI; Gabby Aitchison, Icon Architecture):</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Project Goals:</strong> Affordability (100% affordable, exploring deeper subsidies), streetscape activation (engaging design, expanded sidewalk space, welcoming facade), and sustainability (all-electric, Enterprise Green Community certified, Passive House building).</li>
<li><strong>Project Overview:</strong><ul>
<li>Fully income-restricted affordable rental community for individuals and families.</li>
<li>95 apartments: 40 age-restricted one-bedroom units for older adults, 55 family homes (high percentage of two and three-bedroom units).</li>
<li>Community hub for resident and neighborhood use.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Community Process:</strong><ul>
<li>Over 15 meetings with city staff (housing, urban design, transportation, zoning, sustainability, DPW, fire department).</li>
<li>On-site and small group meetings with neighbors (Spring 2024).</li>
<li>Website launched for project information and feedback.</li>
<li>Presentations to Baldwin Neighborhood Council and Porter Square Neighborhood Association (Fall 2024, Spring 2025).</li>
<li>Three AHO hybrid community meetings, including an open house format for feedback on design elements (cornice, facade, windows, plantings, programming). Community voted on preferred brick, siding, and stone-look materials.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Ground Floor Design:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Operational Spaces:</strong> Parking for staff, management office (full-time property manager), maintenance office (full-time superintendent), large bike room (77 indoor spots with separate entrance).</li>
<li><strong>Residential Community Spaces:</strong> Large community room overlooking courtyard, sunroom (lounge space for older adults), two quiet rooms for study/meetings.</li>
<li><strong>Community Engagement Staff:</strong> Meeting room at front, larger resident services room. Full-time community engagement coordinator and part-time services coordinator for older adults.</li>
<li><strong>Community Hub:</strong> Available for larger community use (afterschool, dance, cooking, wellness, financial education, crafting, computer classes, neighborhood gatherings). Separate entrance from Wendell Street, classroom-sized space, smaller meeting room, separate bathrooms, storage.</li>
<li><strong>Little Free Library:</strong> Outdoor lending library to continue tradition.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Building Design Evolution (Gabby Aitchison):</strong><ul>
<li><strong>June 2024 (First Community Meeting):</strong> Nine-story main mass, seven stories on either side. Established core goals: massing breakdown, brick use, window grouping.</li>
<li><strong>November 2024 (Second Community Meeting):</strong> Reduced to eight stories (main body), six stories on either side (final height). Increased brick, simplified entry trellis, explored traditional base-middle-top design, warmer colors, window groupings. Positive feedback on brick.</li>
<li><strong>March 2025 (Third Community Meeting):</strong> Brick concentrated at full-height bookends (six stories) to relate to neighborhood masonry buildings. Enhanced brick detailing (datums, softened edges). Subtle base-middle-top with central portion accents. Updated entry canopy.</li>
<li><strong>August 2025 (First Planning Board Meeting - Current Design):</strong> Refined rhythm with vertical siding sections and varying window widths. Soldier coursing at first/second floor. Cornice at top of brick reinforces six-story datum.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Materials:</strong> Variety of complementary colors and textures. Full brick (not thin brick) allows for detailing (stacked bond, soldier coursing, modern coining). Stone-look siding at base. Dark bronze window frames. High level of continuous insulation for energy efficiency.</li>
<li><strong>Entries:</strong> Two distinct entries on Wendell Street: Community Hub (separate, unique entrance) and Main Residential Entrance (purposefully larger). Both integrate signage, lighting, material.</li>
<li><strong>Pedestrian Experience:</strong> Renderings from various vantage points on Wendell Street. High transparency at ground floor hub. Variation in setbacks, wider sidewalks at entry points. Playful brick detailing near Little Free Library. Lighter color palette at rear facade.</li>
<li><strong>Site Plan:</strong><ul>
<li>Building shape allows for south-facing courtyard (daylight, minimal shadows on street).</li>
<li>North side outdoor spaces activate streetscape (seating, bike racks, Little Free Library).</li>
<li>Plantings for separation (seating from sidewalk, parcel from parking).</li>
<li><strong>Wendell Street:</strong> Playful concrete seating near Little Free Library, sculptural seating at residential entry, seat wall steps at hub plaza. 6 bike spaces near library, 4 near hub.</li>
<li><strong>Rear Courtyard:</strong> Range of activities, defined by trellis, furniture, nature play seating. Accessible permeable surface. Variety of seating. Exploring shade options.</li>
<li><strong>Plantings:</strong> Native, drought, and shade tolerant trees, shrubs, low plantings.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Next Steps:</strong> Refine design (front canopies, cornice), explore material variations, Article 22 submission, Passive House pre-certification, coordinate with engineers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Public Comment:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Kathy Higgins (345 Norfolk Street):</strong> Strong support for the 8-story building, citing the need for affordable housing and HRI's responsiveness to community feedback. Noted the Baldwin neighborhood's lack of affordable housing.</li>
<li><strong>Teresa Cardosi (7 Woodrow Wilson Court):</strong> Praised HRI's consideration of community input, including redesigning for intergenerational housing (40 elderly, 55 family units) and reducing height from 9 to 8 stories (though regretting the loss of 15 units). Highlighted voluntary setbacks.</li>
<li><strong>Benjamin Wergaft (35 Wendell Street):</strong> Expressed deep disquiet about the project's scale, calling it a "colossus" that changes the street's character. Criticized HRI's handling of neighborhood feedback, alleging suppression of dissent. Requested amendments on height, mass, and scale.</li>
<li><strong>Theodore Live (17 Wendell Street):</strong> Stated neighborhood impression that the building is out of proportion, despite being a fine building on its own. Compared it to a "Verizon headquarters." Criticized insufficient setbacks compared to surrounding Victorian homes.</li>
<li><strong>Sean Hart:</strong> Strong support for the project, commending developers' efforts and the need for housing. Acknowledged height reduction but emphasized the project aligns with upzoning goals.</li>
<li><strong>Matt Begadano (118 Oxford Street):</strong> Expressed concerns about cost overruns, suggesting mass timber (cross-laminated timber) as an alternative. Raised issues with infrastructure (parking, electrical, sewer) and skepticism about no-car residents. Suspected future scaling back due to cost.</li>
<li><strong>Gabe Malseptic (31 Wendell Street):</strong> Delighted by affordable housing but found the 90-foot building monolithic and dominating. Criticized lack of parking, calling it a "depot" for commercial operations. Accused developers of selective community engagement. Advocated for a 6-story scale.</li>
<li><strong>Jim Stockard (141 Oxford Street):</strong> Enthusiastic support, emphasizing the need for safe, permanent, affordable homes for families and elderly residents. Praised the multi-generational aspect and proximity to schools/services. Prioritized family needs over building height/setback.</li>
<li><strong>Justin Saif (259 Harley Street):</strong> Strong support for the design, noting its fit with the neighborhood and other nearby buildings. Aligned with city's goal of thickening corridors off Mass Ave. Highlighted environmental benefits (reduced traffic, green building).</li>
<li><strong>James Zoll (203 Pemberton Street):</strong> Pleased with the design, calling it a "great building" that adds to the neighborhood. Impressed by efforts for seniors and families. Thanked the city for AHO. Regretted loss of 15 homes and the intensity of community meetings.</li>
<li><strong>Lou Wergeft (35 Wendell Street):</strong> As an abutter, concerned about shadows on his garden. Stated neighborhood opposition to scale, not affordable housing. Criticized HRI for ignoring growing neighborhood sentiment and changing meeting formats to suppress dissent.</li>
<li><strong>Zannie Alter (35 Pemberton Street):</strong> Expressed appreciation and gratitude for the project, commending HRI's responsiveness to community feedback. Emphasized the importance of affordable housing for low-income students and families in Cambridge. Supported the design.</li>
<li><strong>Joel Bard (51 Wendell Street):</strong> Stated neighborhood welcomes affordable housing but concerns scale. Criticized presentation for not showing context of wood-framed structures, only the 5-story brick building. Urged Planning Board to consider context and scale.</li>
<li><strong>Rachel Plummer (10 Wendell Street):</strong> Wholehearted support for the proposed development. Appreciated HRI's process despite neighborhood tensions, noting the need for more voices to be heard. Acknowledged potential discomfort (parking, larger structure) but deemed it necessary given housing needs.</li>
<li><strong>Esther Hainig (136 Pine Street):</strong> Strong support, praising the diverse neighborhood, 95 new affordable homes, and HRI's resident services. Commended the well-designed building, its aesthetic appeal, and the recessed height at street level.</li>
<li><strong>Lucy Angles (47 Wendell Street):</strong> Strong support, acknowledging neighbor concerns but emphasizing the project's importance for families to live in the Baldwin neighborhood.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Board Discussion and Recommendations:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Diego Macias:</strong> Asked if a narrower, stepped-back massing (taller in the center) was considered to blend with the neighborhood context.<ul>
<li><strong>Eleni Makrakis:</strong> Explained that large family units restrict floor plate design, and higher buildings increase costs.</li>
<li><strong>Gabby Aitchison:</strong> Noted AHO provisions limited height when schematic design began.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Ashley Tan:</strong> Asked about transportation demand measures, especially for elderly residents, and paratransit parking.<ul>
<li><strong>Eleni Makrakis:</strong> Mentioned bus lines on Mass Ave, robust bike room, pull-in garage/driveway for pick-ups. Plans for move-in Charlie cards and connecting residents to low-income programs via on-site services.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Ted Cohen:</strong> Asked to see material samples and about the aesthetics of the garage door.<ul>
<li><strong>Eleni Makrakis:</strong> Showed brick, main body (willow gray), base (granite-like), and accent colors. Offered to schedule in-person viewing.</li>
<li><strong>Gabby Aitchison:</strong> Garage door is at current curb cut, limited width. Still specifying exact door, currently painted to match brick.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Dan Anderson:</strong> Asked about the proportioning of the 9-story vs. 8-story design (bookends vs. setback portion) and increasing front yard setback.<ul>
<li><strong>Gabby Aitchison:</strong> Bookends were always two stories below the top; when reduced from 9 to 8 stories, bookends went from 7 to 6 stories. No discussion of keeping bookends shorter with a taller setback portion due to structural system and unit layouts.</li>
<li><strong>Eleni Makrakis:</strong> Front setback is 19 feet, aligning with other Wendell Street properties. Rear setback is 15 feet (AHO stipulation), allowing for usable space and concealed condensers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Carolyn Zern:</strong> Appreciated dedication to affordable housing, passive house, and soldier coursing. Suggested more window sill/lintel detailing. Asked if transformer and fire command center could be activated or moved from Wendell Street. Inquired about unused roof space. Asked CDD staff about fire department review process.<ul>
<li><strong>Eleni Makrakis:</strong> Transformer requires a 3-hour vault and street access. Fire command center requires direct exterior access per fire department request.</li>
<li><strong>Gabby Aitchison:</strong> Roof space planned for PV solar.</li>
<li><strong>Jeff Roberts:</strong> Confirmed fire department reviews all building permits.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Tom Sieniewicz:</strong><ul>
<li>Asked why 8 stories was the correct height, given the ability to go higher.<ul>
<li><strong>Eleni Makrakis:</strong> Balance of city mandate for affordable units, HRI's mission, financial feasibility (expensive land), and community feedback (honoring pushback from 9 stories). Intergenerational mix reduces car demand.</li>
<li><strong>Kate Gilmore (HRI):</strong> Added that on-site management and maintenance offices are critical for a successful community, enabled by the scale.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Requested a physical or digital model in context for the next hearing.</li>
<li>Questioned the timing of the hearing, noting the design is well-advanced, making major adjustments difficult.<ul>
<li><strong>Eleni Makrakis:</strong> Aimed to present a confident, proud design after extensive community and city staff engagement. Acknowledged push-and-pull in timing but noted flexibility for cornices and materials.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Mary Flynn (Chair):</strong><ul>
<li>Commended applicant for community engagement and public for input.</li>
<li>Urged city to consider earlier Planning Board input on massing.</li>
<li>Noted the design feels like a "solid facade with two bookends," losing the "base of the building." Suggested consistent patterning/texture across the base.</li>
<li>Questioned the corner brick detailing.</li>
<li>Expressed concern about the "gray" tone of the rear facade.</li>
<li>Landscape design feels "piecemeal" and could be improved (e.g., low walkable planting, lack of vegetation in courtyard, unappealing strolling path near maintenance doors).</li>
<li>Requested more details on fence selection and detailing to create a beautiful edge.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Tom Sieniewicz:</strong><ul>
<li>Questioned "storefront" character of Wendell Street ground floor, suggesting it doesn't fit the residential character.</li>
<li>Emphasized the importance of cornice detailing to affect the perception of height and bulk, suggesting dropping it down to create a wider top/attic-like space.</li>
<li>Called the "playful" library description "serious" and "real," suggesting the design could recognize the history of Lesley University and local placemaking.</li>
<li>Praised the use of real brick and looked forward to substantial, carefully thought-out details.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Dan Anderson:</strong><ul>
<li>Echoed Mary and Tom's comments.</li>
<li>Suggested more landscape in the rear, less in the front, or hardscape to create breathing room on Wendell Street.</li>
<li>Advocated for earlier input on scale and massing.</li>
<li>Suggested different character for storefront material/glazing, more appropriate to taller portion.</li>
<li>Recommended integrating the community hub more internally with the residential lobby.</li>
<li>Skeptical of vestibule location, suggesting shifting it one bay east.</li>
<li>Suggested opening common room/sunrooms to the courtyard for more activation.</li>
<li>Requested sun shadow study and more robust contextual renderings/site plans for next session.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Ashley Tan:</strong><ul>
<li>Appreciated senior and larger family units, sunroom, and community rooms.</li>
<li>Suggested opening up the south-facing open space to the sunroom/resident room for more flexibility and engagement.</li>
<li>Recommended more texture/color variation to break down building bulk.</li>
<li>Liked the urban design memo's suggestion about the cornice line on the A4 to de-emphasize height.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Ted Cohen:</strong><ul>
<li>Liked the building and 95 affordable units, replacing "undistinguished" buildings.</li>
<li>Applauded colleagues' suggestions for improvements.</li>
<li>Liked brick and cornice lines, but concerned about "gray" appearance and garage door aesthetics.</li>
<li>Urged more thought on color scheme and garage door design.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Diego Macias:</strong><ul>
<li>Liked the design, intergenerational components, and "quirks" like the library and alternating brick.</li>
<li>Agreed with other board members' points.</li>
<li>Suggested wider bike storage spots for cargo bikes.</li>
<li>Looked forward to a digital 3D model.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Mary Flynn (Chair):</strong><ul>
<li>Agreed with opening rooms to the courtyard.</li>
<li>Felt the building looked "flat" and "dull," like a "Leslie dormitory," not residential.</li>
<li>Reiterated need for more contextual views, especially looking down Wendell Street towards Mass Ave.</li>
<li>Expressed regret that major changes are difficult at this stage and recommended staff encourage earlier proponent engagement.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Motion:</strong> To conclude the design consultation session and submit an initial report with comments to the developer.<ul>
