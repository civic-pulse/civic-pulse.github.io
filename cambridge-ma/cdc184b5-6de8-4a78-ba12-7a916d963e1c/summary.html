<p>The Cambridge City Council convened a special meeting to address the critical situation at 221 Mount Auburn Street. The primary purpose was to discuss updates on the property and the city's actions to protect public health and safety, specifically regarding the demolition of the building. The Council voted to approve an appropriation of $20 million from the General Fund Employee Benefits Department, Salary and Wages Account, to the General Fund Reserve Department Extraordinary Expenditure Account to fund the demolition. This appropriation is a temporary measure, with plans to replenish the employee benefits account with certified free cash once available.

<ul>
<li><strong>Ann Saada</strong>, 60 Larchwood Drive, Cambridge (formerly 221 Mount Auburn Street), President of the Board of Trustees of the Riverview and Cambridge Condo Trust:<ul>
<li>Expressed gratitude to Mayor Simmons, the Council, and city staff for addressing the complex situation at 221 Mount Auburn Street.</li>
<li>Stated that the main building, a nine-story, 65-unit structure, was evacuated in December 2024 due to an "uncontrolled collapse" risk.</li>
<li>Initial hopes for repair were dashed after investigations revealed the building could not be repaired or shored.</li>
<li>The Condo Association lacked the means to demolish the building.</li>
<li>Highlighted the demographic of the Riverview community as an "naturally occurring retirement community," with many elderly, often single or widowed residents, some living there since 1972.</li>
<li>Acknowledged the city's commitment to public safety and the understanding that demolition costs would be recovered from condo owners.</li>
<li>"As citizens, we're grateful to be living in a city that puts public health and safety first and finds concrete and immediate ways to address complex challenges."</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Jayden Rowerdink</strong>, Four Longfellow Road, Cambridge:<ul>
<li>Raised concerns about increased traffic and speeding on detour routes (Rattle and nearby streets) due to the closure of Mount Auburn Street.</li>
<li>Noted vehicles traveling at 40-50 mph in 25 mph zones, creating danger for pedestrians, cyclists, and families.</li>
<li>Requested the Council and Traffic Department to:<ul>
<li>Treat detour routes as part of the demolition safety plan.</li>
<li>Install temporary speeding cameras.</li>
<li>Increase fines (similar to construction zones).</li>
<li>Provide weekly updates on safety measures.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>"We understand the building needs to come down quickly, but the surrounding neighborhoods also need protection while this project moves forward."</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Harriet Griesinger</strong>, 11 Granville Road #1, Cambridge (formerly 221 Mount Auburn Street), Member of the Board of Trustees of Riverview and Cambridge Condominium Trust:<ul>
<li>Attempted to sign up for public comment earlier.</li>
<li>Echoed Ann Saada's sentiments regarding the building's condition and the need for demolition.</li>
<li>Stated the building is "too weak to repair," at risk of "uncontrolled collapse," near other homes and pathways, and contains asbestos in almost all units.</li>
<li>Emphasized that owners, many of whom are elderly (speaker is 85), cannot afford the demolition costs.</li>
<li>Acknowledged the financial implications for Cambridge taxpayers, noting her long history as a taxpayer since 1971.</li>
<li>Understood that if the appropriation is approved, costs would be recovered from owners through large charges on tax bills, paid before any sale proceeds.</li>
<li>"The building has become a public safety issue and should be demolished."</li>

<h4 id="v-city-managers-agenda-item-no-1-appropriation-for-221-mount-auburn-street-demolition">V. City Manager's Agenda Item No. 1: Appropriation for 221 Mount Auburn Street Demolition</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>City Manager's Recommendation:</strong> Transmitting communication from Yi-An Huang, City Manager, relative to the appropriation of $20,000,000 from the General Fund Employee Benefits Department, Salary and Wages Account, to the General Fund Reserve Department Extraordinary Expenditure Account to fund expenses relative to the demolition of 221 Mount Auburn Street.<ul>
<li><strong>City Manager's Agenda Item Number:</strong> 186</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>City Manager Yi-An Huang's Remarks:</strong><ul>
<li>Thanked Mayor Simmons for calling the meeting and emphasized the tragic and unprecedented nature of the situation.</li>
<li>Highlighted the city's focus on public safety and supporting residents and neighbors.</li>
<li>Commended Deputy City Manager Kathy Watkins for coordinating efforts across multiple departments (Law, ISD, DPW, Traffic, Finance, Communications, Community Engagement).</li>
<li>Acknowledged the difficult choices involved, including traffic impacts and costs.</li>
<li>Expressed gratitude to the Riverview condo residents and the Condo Association for their empathy and professionalism.</li>
<li>Stressed the importance of transparency, noting a dedicated website with documents, an in-person community meeting two weeks prior, and a virtual meeting scheduled for July 24th.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Deputy City Manager Kathy Watkins' Remarks:</strong><ul>
<li>Provided a high-level overview of the situation.</li>
<li><strong>Background:</strong> In 2023, during roof replacement and drainage improvements, the Riverview Condos identified unexpected conditions in balconies, leading to an investigation.</li>
<li><strong>Structural Defects:</strong><ul>
<li>Structural rebar was consistently two inches lower than specified in original design drawings.</li>
<li>Concrete strength was found to be 2,000 pounds per square inch (psi), significantly lower than the specified 3,000 psi.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Engineering Analysis:</strong> SGH (a reputable engineering firm) determined that repairing the building was not feasible, with estimated costs exceeding $80 million.</li>
<li><strong>Demolition Decision:</strong> The Condo Association concluded they could not manage the demolition themselves and contacted the city in late May.</li>
<li><strong>City's Role:</strong><ul>
<li>The city confirmed the Condo Association had exhausted all options.</li>
<li>ISD formally notified the board of the public safety and public health situation requiring demolition.</li>
<li>The Board of Survey (comprising the Building Inspector, City Engineer, Fire Chief, and an independent engineer) concurred that demolition is necessary.</li>
<li>Under state law, the city has the authority to perform the work if the owner cannot.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Public Safety Concerns:</strong><ul>
<li>The primary concern is "punching shear," a failure point where columns connect to the concrete slab. SGH identified a significant number of these connections as "potentially dangerous" under building code.</li>
<li>The risk is exacerbated by snow loads; even without snow, many connections remain dangerous.</li>
<li>The city aims to have demolition "significantly underway" before snowfall to reduce risk.</li>
<li>Utilities have been disconnected to mitigate risks in a vacant building.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Cost of Demolition:</strong><ul>
<li>The $20 million appropriation is a "conservative number" due to many unknowns.</li>
<li>This is a complex demolition; traditional methods (pre-demolition interior removal) are not possible due to the building's condition.</li>
<li>All material will be treated as hazardous due to asbestos, increasing disposal costs five to ten times.</li>
<li>Significant engineering, planning, and permitting (through DEP) are required.</li>
<li>The city is committed to managing costs closely but prioritizes public health and safety.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>City Solicitor Megan Baer's Remarks:</strong><ul>
<li>The city's authority to undertake this work stems from Chapter 143 of the General Laws, which allows intervention for dangerous buildings when owners are unable or unwilling to act.</li>
<li>Clarified that this is <strong>not</strong> an eminent domain taking; the city will not own the property but will abate the dangerous situation.</li>
<li><strong>Cost Recovery:</strong><ul>
<li>Demolition costs become a debt owed to the city by the owners.</li>
<li>If unpaid, the city can record a statement of debt at the Registry of Deeds, creating a lien on the property with the same priority as a tax lien.</li>
<li>This allows the city to recover funds through a sale of the property or a tax title taking.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The city plans to file a court case to obtain a court order confirming its authority before demolition begins.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Council Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Councilor Nolan:</strong><ul>
<li>Acknowledged the tragic situation for residents who have lost life savings.</li>
<li>Inquired about the appropriateness of discussing traffic-related issues during this meeting.</li>
<li><strong>Mayor Simmons</strong> clarified that while traffic concerns are valid, the immediate scope of the meeting is the appropriation. A memo and future community meeting will address broader neighborhood concerns.</li>
<li>Questioned the funding source (employee benefits account) instead of free cash.</li>
<li><strong>CFO Claire Spinner</strong> explained that free cash certification typically occurs in late September/early October. The transfer from the employee benefits account is temporary, and the city will seek a free cash appropriation to replenish it once certified.</li>
<li>Expressed support for the appropriation despite the challenges.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Zusy:</strong><ul>
<li>Asked for an estimate of the land's value.</li>
<li><strong>Deputy City Manager Watkins</strong> stated that the value of the land is "in excess of $20 million," based on information received.</li>
<li>Inquired about the entity responsible for repayment and property sale after the Condo Association dissolves.</li>
<li><strong>City Solicitor Baer</strong> explained that the Condo Association will undergo a "partition action" in land court to dissolve and convert ownership to "tenants in common." The Land Court will determine individual ownership interests. The city will monitor this process to ensure proper lien placement. The Land Court will likely be involved in the property's sale.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Siddiqui:</strong><ul>
<li>Sought clarification on the timeline for recouping costs.</li>
<li><strong>City Solicitor Baer</strong> confirmed that the timeline is contingent on several factors, including incurring costs and meeting statutory deadlines for lien protection.</li>
<li><strong>Deputy City Manager Watkins</strong> added that the Condo Association's representatives anticipate the land court process to take at least one year.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
