                <td>Good morning, everyone. I&#39;m calling today&#39;s meeting of the city clerk&#39;s preliminary screening committee to order. The purpose of today&#39;s meeting is for the committee to meet and go into executive session to consider applicants for the position of the city clerk by a preliminary screening committee. We are going into executive session because by doing so in open session would have a detrimental effect in obtaining qualified applicants. The committee will not be returning to open session once executive session is adjourned. Our first order of business is to call the role of the members present that are serving on the committee. So I will turn this over to the assistant clerk to call the role.</td>
