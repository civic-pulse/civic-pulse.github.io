<li><strong>Outcome:</strong> Taken off the table.</li>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li>Councilor Toner presented a substitute motion with language recommended by legal counsel to address concerns about potential legal issues with the original wording.</li>
<li>Mayor Simmons opposed the substitute motion, arguing that it sanitizes the policy order and fails to express the Council's displeasure with Apex's treatment of workers.</li>
<li>City Solicitor Behr explained that while the Council is not directly bound by the contract, the original language could be interpreted as a breach by Apex, leading to litigation. Recommended broadening the policy order to focus on prioritizing union labor in future agreements.</li>
<li>City Manager Huang supported the substitute order, noting that the virtual power purchase agreement is complex and crucial for climate goals.</li>
<li>Councilor Siddiqui inquired if the unions were consulted on the substitute language. Councilor Toner confirmed they were not.</li>
<li>Councilor Nolan expressed concern about the city's risk if the original order is passed, noting that Apex claims to have met its commitment to local labor. Supported the substitute motion to avoid potential breach of contract.</li>
<li>Councilor Zusy supported the "sanitized" version to avoid risk.</li>
<li>Vice Mayor McGovern expressed reluctance to support the watered-down version without union input.</li>
<li><strong>Motion to Table:</strong> Councilor Toner moved to table the order.</li>
