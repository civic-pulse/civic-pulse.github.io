<li>Councilor Nolan (Chair of Health and Environment Committee) agreed to hold a committee meeting, likely in November, and to ensure broad community notification. She acknowledged the controversial nature of some proposals and the public health threat of vaping products.</li>
<li>Sam Lipson (Senior Director of Environmental Health, Cambridge Public Health Department) explained that the proposal aims to move tobacco and nicotine enforcement to the Board of Health via regulation, allowing for more nimble updates to keep pace with industry tactics. City Council would retain control over citywide policies (e.g., nicotine-free generation, permit caps).</li>
<li>Chief Neal (Department of Public Health) emphasized the public health aspect, particularly the disproportionate impact on marginalized communities, and the need for Cambridge to align with state policy.</li>

<li><strong>Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li>Councilor Toner supported the order, emphasizing the need for outreach to legal Airbnb operators to avoid harming them due to a few "bad actors."</li>

<li>Vice Mayor McGovern noted that the Ordinance Committee meeting highlighted the need for this policy order to develop language and recommendations, acknowledging that significant changes (e.g., day limits) would require refiling the ordinance.</li>
<li>Councilor Zusy supported the order, suggesting a requirement for short-term rental operators to only list Cambridge-registered units.</li>

<li><strong>Amendment:</strong> Councilor Nolan proposed adding a "whereas" clause: "WHEREAS: Boston conducted a pilot using Flock, the same system Cambridge will deploy, and chose not to share data and to prohibit sharing their database out of concern for potential harm."</li>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li>Councilor Nolan (proponent) explained the order's intent to re-evaluate Flock deployment due to new information about data sharing with federal and state agencies, and changes to the welcoming city ordinance.</li>
<li>Councilor Sobrinho-Wheeler supported the amendment, noting that Flock retains ownership of cameras and data, which is accessible nationally, raising concerns about privacy and potential misuse (e.g., abortion-related tracking).</li>
<li>Councilor Toner sought clarification from the City Manager on whether the city controls the data and if it is shared.</li>
<li>City Manager Huang stated that the police department's policy is to be careful with data agreements and secure data in a segregated way. He acknowledged that rules are changing in real-time and further examination is warranted.</li>
