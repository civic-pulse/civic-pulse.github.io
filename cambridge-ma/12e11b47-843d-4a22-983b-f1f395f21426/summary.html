<h3 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h3>
<p>The Cambridge Planning Board convened for a public hearing on May 6th, 2025, to address two key items. The first involved a Floodplain Special Permit application by IQHQ Alewife LLC for improvements around Jerry's Pond, which received unanimous approval due to extensive community engagement and significant public benefits.

<h3 id="ii-public-hearing-case-pb408-floodplain-special-permit-application-by-iqhq-alewife-llc">II. Public Hearing: Case PB408 - Floodplain Special Permit Application by IQHQ Alewife LLC</h3>
<p><strong>Applicant:</strong> IQHQ Alewife LLC
<strong>Project:</strong> Improvements to the area around Jerry's Pond, including pedestrian paths, boardwalks, a pavilion, and landscaping.
<strong>Special Permit Type:</strong> Floodplain Special Permit</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>CDD Staff Explanation (Jeff Roberts, Director of Zoning and Development):</strong><ul>
<li>This is a new application solely for a Floodplain Special Permit, with no significant development proposed.</li>
<li>The proposed improvements are part of the community benefits component of a previously approved IQHQ commercial development (on a separate site) that also received a Floodplain Special Permit.</li>
<li>The project is proceeding under current FEMA standards, as a zoning petition to eliminate the Floodplain Special Permit and change to administrative review, incorporating revised flood maps, will not be effective until July 8th, 2025. This case is likely one of the last Floodplain Special Permit cases the Board will review.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Applicant Presentation (Anthony Galluccio, Partner, Galluccio and Watson; Chrissy Gabriel, Senior Director, IQHQ; Howard Mosier, VHB; Danny Frias, Project Manager, IQHQ):</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Community Engagement:</strong> Extensive outreach since 2021 with groups like Alewife Study Group, Friends of Jerry's Pond, Ocean Institute, Mass Audubon, and Green Cambridge. Interns from the Ridge Avenue community were involved.</li>
<li><strong>Permitting Process:</strong> Started with community meetings, followed by a large project special permit approval in 2022 with a condition to deliver this plan. Recent approval from the Conservation Commission with an Order of Conditions.</li>
<li><strong>Site Overview:</strong> Jerry's Pond side (green and blue area) is not intended for development. Development is concentrated to the north. Zoning allowed transfer of development rights to protect Jerry's Pond.</li>
<li><strong>Key Design Elements &amp; Community Feedback Integration:</strong><ul>
<li>Minimizing bike conflicts on paths and connecting to adjacent DCR and city properties.</li>
<li>Maximizing usable area along Ridge Avenue (additional 33 feet width).</li>
<li>Creative solutions to protect existing trees and habitat, avoiding soil disruption.</li>
<li>Optimal location for the Eco Center, determined through site walks.</li>
<li>Abundant seating and congregation areas.</li>
<li>Emphasis on safety throughout design.</li>
<li>Maintaining activation area connecting to Russell Field and Como Field.</li>
<li>Commitment areas beyond Jerry's Pond footprint, including Como Field curb restructuring and MBTA headhouse improvements.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Project Schedule:</strong> Jerry's Pond improvements are ahead of schedule, aiming for completion before the last building on the northern development site.</li>
<li><strong>Floodplain Overlay:</strong> The blue dashed line on the detailed plan indicates the 100-year floodplain limit. Elements within this area include a floating wetland, Ridge Avenue improvements, and boardwalks supported by minor piles, representing a "very light touch" with significant public benefits.</li>
<li><strong>Pathway Connectivity:</strong> Expansion of boardwalk areas (orange) to provide a calmer route closer to Jerry's Pond, away from busy multi-use paths.</li>
<li><strong>Bike Parking:</strong> Additional bike parking with racks provided, exceeding current requirements.</li>
<li><strong>Ridge Avenue Improvements:</strong><ul>
<li>300-foot, 10-foot wide universally accessible boardwalk parallel to the street with a planting buffer.</li>
<li>Street trees, a floating wetland, and an ADA ramp.</li>
<li>Preservation of existing ash tree.</li>
<li>Bicyclists must stay on the sidewalk, with clear pedestrian-only signs.</li>

<li>3,600 sq ft of understory planting for ecological health, habitat restoration, and water filtration.</li>
<li>Flexible shaded gathering area with seating and overlooks on the west end of Ridge Avenue.</li>
<li>Boardwalk follows existing slope (max 4.5% grade) for ADA compliance, with an 8-foot overlook bump-out.</li>
<li>Boardwalk is near ground level to allow floodwater flow underneath.</li>
<li>Widened 10-foot sidewalk and 2-foot utility corridor at Ridge Avenue entry.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Ecological Features:</strong> Floating wetland provides habitat support and water filtration, an idea from the community.</li>
<li><strong>Jerry's Deck &amp; Eco Pavilion:</strong><ul>
<li>Jerry's Deck: Large open space with flexible seating, pond views, and linear path access.</li>
<li>Eco Pavilion: Covered structure for community programs, operated by Mass Audubon for seasonal learning and outdoor events.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Compensatory Flood Storage:</strong> Dedicated portion in the southeast corner to minimize tree loss and meet regulatory standards.</li>
<li><strong>Site Operations:</strong><ul>
<li>Public walkways outside gates (green areas) open 24/7.</li>
<li>Dark blue areas (boardwalks) open dawn to dusk, with gates (light blue areas) controlling access.</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Bike Committee Memo:</strong> Applicant had a meeting and is prepared to respond to comments.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Public Comment:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Renata Pomponi (Mass Audubon, 668 Memorial Drive):</strong> Expressed excitement and support for the project. Highlighted Mass Audubon's involvement in ecological recommendations and the design of the Eco-Pavilion, which they will operate as a seasonal nature center. Commended extensive community input and ecological improvements.</li>
<li><strong>Mackie Buck (18 Gold Star Road, Friends of Jerry's Pond):</strong> Excited about the plans, especially community gardens and floating wetlands. Concerns about bittersweet removal and the amount of remaining paving on site, advocating for further depaving for carbon sequestration.</li>
<li><strong>Lisa Burke (20 Castle Park, Co-founder Alewife Study Group):</strong> Praised IQHQ's exceptional community process and the "miraculous" results. Emphasized the project's ability to build community and its sensitive approach. Supported the project while echoing concerns about paving and bittersweet. Commended IQHQ's ongoing communication.</li>
<li><strong>Eric Grunenbaum (98 Montgomery Street, Co-founder Friends of Jerry's Pond):</strong> Thanked IQHQ team for an "outstanding" project. Proud of the vision for accessibility, sustainability, and environmental education. Happy about Mass Audubon's involvement.</li>
<li><strong>Joel Nodrick (94 Clifton Street, Founding Member Alewife Study Group):</strong> Reinforced appreciation for the excellent process and fantastic project. Supported the floodplain overlay for compensatory storage. Appreciated increased bike parking but suggested considering larger bikes and more locations, as per the Cambridge Bicycle Committee memo. Noted the need for DCR to improve the uneven sidewalk along Alewife Parkway.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Board Questions &amp; Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Mary Leydecker:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Decking Material:</strong> Confirmed composite decking for sustainability and maintenance reasons, as EPA wood became endangered and pressure-treated wood required annual sealing. Railings will be consistent with the Alewife Brook Reservation boardwalk aesthetic.</li>
<li><strong>Floating Wetland Siting:</strong> Explained that the Eco-Pavilion was sited for pristine views across the pond to observe birds and away from Ridge Avenue traffic. Floating wetlands were placed along Ridge Avenue to introduce green space, connect to community concepts, and potentially improve water quality. They are tethered and can be relocated.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Diego Macias:</strong> Inquired about the Cambridge Bicycle Committee memo. Applicant confirmed exceeding bike parking requirements and addressing concerns about the DCR path.</li>
<li><strong>Dan Anderson:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Maintenance &amp; Security:</strong> IQHQ will take on full maintenance, snow removal, and security, considering it part of their property. CBRE will manage the site 24/7. Mass Audubon will be a permanent partner, involved in any work affecting the site.</li>
<li><strong>Design Suggestions:</strong> Encouraged careful consideration of lighting for security and night sky issues. Suggested re-evaluating thermally modified wood options over composites. Proposed exploring opportunities at the bus turnaround for a more integrated boardwalk view of the shoreline and softening the boardwalk's edge where it meets land for landscaping and seating.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Jen Sweet (Haley and Aldridge):</strong> Clarified that significant depaving has already occurred in the compensatory flood storage area. IQHQ is committed to further depaving where feasible without damaging trees or protective covers.</li>
<li><strong>Howard Mosier (VHB):</strong> Reiterated IQHQ's commitment to depaving beyond requirements. Emphasized the project's stormwater benefits. Noted the Eco Center's siting also considered avoiding tailpipe emissions from Ridge Avenue.</li>
<li><strong>Mary Flynn:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Grill Use:</strong> Explained the single grill is for small gatherings and educational events, managed by online reservation. It's not intended for large-scale use. Other seating areas may serve as impromptu picnic spots.</li>
<li><strong>Maintenance Plan:</strong> Confirmed IQHQ's property management (CBRE) will handle daily maintenance and security, with a commitment to hiring locally.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Board Deliberation:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Mary Leydecker:</strong> Commended extensive community process. Appreciated thoughtful design, including Ridge Avenue improvements and canopy trees. Encouraged continued attention to fencing aesthetics and exploring alternative decking materials. Raised questions about long-term landscape management and invasive species, but noted Green Cambridge and Mass Audubon's involvement provides assurance.</li>
<li><strong>Diego Macias:</strong> Praised the project and community outreach process.</li>
<li><strong>Dan Anderson:</strong> Supported the project, particularly the helical pile solution for compensatory storage. Supported bike parking provisions.</li>
<li><strong>H. Theodore Cohen:</strong> Congratulated IQHQ and community for a "tremendous plan." Supported the Floodplain Special Permit, noting the Conservation Commission's prior approval and the Board's limited expertise in this area. Supported the bike parking provisions.</li>
<li><strong>Ashley Tan:</strong> Thanked the proponent for addressing community concerns. Supported the project, emphasizing welcoming and safe signage and lighting.</li>
<li><strong>Mary Flynn:</strong> Commended the transformation of Jerry's Pit to a valuable city resource. Noted the proponent has met the findings for all three special permits.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Motion to Grant Special Permits:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Motion:</strong> H. Theodore Cohen moved to grant the three special permits (Floodplain Special Permit, Modification of Bicycle Parking Requirements, and General Special Permit) with conditions noted in the zoning and urban design memo, after making the necessary findings that the proposal conforms to the applicable criteria in the zoning ordinance.</li>
<li><strong>Second:</strong> Mary Leydecker.</li>
<li><strong>Roll Call Vote:</strong><ul>
<li>H. Theodore Cohen: Yes</li>
<li>Mary Leydecker: Yes</li>
<li>Diego Macias: Yes</li>

<h3 id="iii-public-hearing-zoning-petition-by-the-city-council-to-amend-cannabis-use-standards-section-118">III. Public Hearing: Zoning Petition by the City Council to Amend Cannabis Use Standards (Section 11.8)</h3>
<p><strong>Petitioner:</strong> Cambridge City Council
<strong>Proposed Amendment:</strong> To remove the provision that prohibits the packaging or repackaging of cannabis products on the premises of a cannabis retail store.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>CDD Staff Overview (Evan Spatrini &amp; Christina D'Alessio, Economic Opportunity and Development Division):</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Proposed Change:</strong> Remove the specific language: "all products offered to consumers shall be prepackaged off site and no packaging or repackaging of cannabis or marijuana products shall take place on the premises of a cannabis retail store unless it also meets the requirements of a cannabis production facility."</li>
<li><strong>Local Cannabis History:</strong> Cambridge has regulated cannabis for over 10 years (medical, then retail). First retailer opened in 2022. Special permit removed from local review in 2023.</li>
<li><strong>Permitting Process:</strong> All cannabis uses require a state marijuana license from the Cannabis Control Commission (CCC). Businesses must meet local regulations, including a Host Community Agreement (HCA) and a Cannabis Business Permit (issued by ISD).</li>
<li><strong>Current Situation:</strong> Many existing operators desire on-site repackaging for customer appeal, affordability, and branding.</li>
<li><strong>Reasons for Proposed Change:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Operator Demand:</strong> Current restriction impacts business.</li>
<li><strong>State Regulations:</strong> The CCC, empowered by the August 2023 "Act relative to equity in the cannabis industry," has indicated Cambridge's restriction conflicts with state code and must be remedied.</li>
<li><strong>Regulatory Updates:</strong> Part of a larger modernization effort, including adjustments to the cannabis business permitting ordinance (discussion at tomorrow's Ordinance Committee).</li>
<li><strong>Building Trends:</strong> Cannabis retailers are often in older, standalone commercial buildings, not the mixed-use buildings the original restriction aimed to protect.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Future Staff Review:</strong> The city plans to move HCA criteria (e.g., odor nuisance plans) to the Cannabis Business Permitting Ordinance. This allows for flexibility, alignment with state codes and industry best practices, and consideration of building type.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Public Comment:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Saba Moses (Green Soul, Central Square):</strong> Supported the recommendation, stating it would help their business thrive and align Cambridge with state allowances, crucial in a competitive market.</li>
<li><strong>Steven DeMarco (86 Kirkland Street):</strong> Supported the amendment, believing it would allow for innovation, benefit customers through bundling and tailored packages, and promote business growth.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Board Questions &amp; Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li>No questions were raised by board members, indicating the proposal was clear and straightforward.</li>
<li><strong>H. Theodore Cohen:</strong> Supported the recommendation, noting it aligns Cambridge with state practices. Recalled the Board's past extensive involvement with cannabis special permits and the positive shift to the building department. Observed that current dispensaries do not create the traffic/parking/odor issues initially feared.</li>
<li><strong>Ashley Tan:</strong> Agreed, noting the state's strict labeling and anti-tampering requirements. Stated that if the state is comfortable with it, Cambridge should not be more restrictive.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Motion to Recommend Adoption:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Motion:</strong> H. Theodore Cohen moved to recommend that the petition be adopted by the City Council.</li>
<li><strong>Second:</strong> Diego Macias.</li>
<li><strong>Roll Call Vote:</strong><ul>
<li>H. Theodore Cohen: Yes</li>
<li>Mary Leydecker: Yes</li>
<li>Diego Macias: Yes</li>
<li>Ashley Tan: Yes</li>
<li>Mary Flynn: Yes</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Outcome:</strong> Motion passed unanimously (5-0).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="iv-adjournment">IV. Adjournment</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Next Meeting:</strong> Next Tuesday evening, discussing design review guidelines on multifamily housing.</li>
<li><strong>Adjournment:</strong> The meeting was adjourned.</li>
