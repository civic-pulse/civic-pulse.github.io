Thank you. A quorum being present, I&#39;m going to call this morning&#39;s meeting to order. So I&#39;ll stop by saying good morning to everyone. Reorient my camera. Good morning, I&#39;m calling today&#39;s meeting of the Preliminary Screening Committee to order. The purpose of this meeting is to review applicants for the position of city clerk. The committee will be going into executive session because not doing so in open, if you have this meeting in open session, it&#39;ll have a detrimental effect on obtaining qualified applicants. The committee will adjourn in executive session and not return into open session. There&#39;ll be no public comment today. Members of the public are welcome to submit written communications to the city clerk&#39;s office at cityclerk at cambridgema.gov. Pursuant to Chapter 2 of the Act of 2025 by the Massachusetts General Court and approved by the governor, the city is authorized to use remote participation at these meetings of the Cambridge City Council and its committee. Having read the call, the first order of business is a roll call of the members present. Ms. Irwin, would you please call the roll? Megan Baer?</td>
