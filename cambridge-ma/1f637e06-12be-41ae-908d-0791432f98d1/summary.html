<li><strong>Siyu Huang (49 Alpine Street):</strong> Spoke about the multi-generational household at 49 Alpine Street, including elderly parents with vision impairment and a husband with knee issues, necessitating an ADA-accessible path. Argued that the curb cut enhances safety for children by minimizing street-side congestion and improving visibility.</li>

Noted 16-17 existing curb cuts on the street and argued the new curb cut would be a net benefit for neighborhood parking.</li>
<li><strong>Denise Gilson (Executive Director, Harvard Square Business Association):</strong> Requested support for Policy Order 71, appropriating $72,000 for an RFP for an engineering study of the abandoned MBTA tunnel beneath Harvard Square.

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Item 1: Federal Update</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong> City Manager Yi-An Huang provided an update on federal funding impacts and local police interactions with ICE.<ul>
<li><strong>Federal Funding:</strong> Harvard University has $3 billion in frozen/canceled federal grants, with over 100 termination notices. MIT has a hiring freeze and 20 stop-work orders for federally funded research. The state has $360 million in frozen/canceled federal grants, including $100 million for ESSER funding and $90 million for climate resilience infrastructure.</li>
<li><strong>ICE Interactions:</strong> Cambridge has a welcoming cities ordinance, meaning CPD does not inquire about immigration status or participate in civil immigration enforcement, except for officer safety or to prevent a breach of peace. City Manager noted a breakdown of trust in federal agencies due to actions like detaining students for op-eds, mistaken detentions, and selective use of social media. Solicitor stated that ICE agents need probable cause but not a judicial warrant to detain in public spaces; a warrant is needed for private spaces. Cars are not considered private property in the same way as a home. CPD will document all interactions with ICE.</li>
<li><strong>Questions:</strong><ul>
<li>Councillor Nolan asked about "Know Your Rights" information for residents regarding ICE interactions.</li>
<li>Vice Mayor McGovern sought clarification on CPD's role in ICE operations, emphasizing that CPD would ensure scene safety and de-escalate crowds, not cooperate with ICE.</li>
<li>Councillor Wilson asked about advising community members to carry documentation and the city's role if children are involved in detentions. Solicitor stated they would consult legal services partners for best practices and that the school department has procedures for ICE activity at schools.</li>
<li>Councillor Azeem asked if CPD would intervene if ICE entered private property without a warrant. Solicitor stated CPD does not have legal jurisdiction to interfere with federal operations.</li>
<li>Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler asked if ICE alerts CPD beforehand (unknown) and about past ICE detainer requests (4 requests, not honored). Commissioner Elow confirmed ICE is active in the community, sometimes waiting outside police stations for individuals released on bail.</li>
<li>Councillor Zusy recommended watching "Know Your Rights" webinars and carrying copies of documents.</li>
<li>Councillor Wilson suggested a roundtable discussion with immigration attorneys and CPD.</li>
<li>Mayor Simmons asked about training for Mayor's Summer Youth Program supervisors regarding ICE interactions. Assistant City Manager Seminoff confirmed training would be provided.</li>
<li>Councillor Nolan asked about the impact of the governor's changes to state shelters on Cambridge. Assistant City Manager Seminoff clarified that the family shelters in Cambridge are separate from the hotel program being addressed by the state.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Motion:</strong> Councillor Nolan moved to place City Manager Agenda Item 1 on file.</li>
<li><strong>Vote:</strong> Unanimous Ayes.</li>
<li><strong>Outcome:</strong> Item 1 placed on file.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Item 4: Five-Year Contract for AED Installation and Maintenance</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong> Councillor Zusy asked about the number, location, and cost of AEDs.<ul>
<li><strong>Response:</strong> Chief Cahill and Captain Jeremy Walsh (Cambridge Fire Department) explained that 46 AEDs would be placed in every public park and athletic field, 24/7, in heated, climate-controlled cabinets. Access requires calling 911 for a code. The AEDs are new Avive devices with two-way communication and GPS. The project was earmarked $270,000 two years ago and is currently under budget.</li>
<li><strong>Questions:</strong><ul>
<li>Councillor Zusy asked about Magazine Beach Park (on the list, requires DCR coordination).</li>
<li>Vice Mayor McGovern asked about multiple AEDs in large parks like Danahy (Danahy will get 3, golf course 4). Suggested signage in other locations.</li>
<li>Councillor Azeem expressed interest in usage statistics.</li>
<li>Councillor Nolan highlighted the importance of ECC directing callers to nearest AEDs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Vote:</strong> Unanimous Ayes.</li>
<li><strong>Outcome:</strong> Item 4 approved and placed on file.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Item 6: Appropriation for Emergency Shelter Operating Costs</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong> Councillor Wilson asked for details on the $298,794 grant from the Executive Office of Housing and Local Communities for the Cambridge Salvation Army Shelter, specifically regarding workforce development.<ul>
<li><strong>Response:</strong> Assistant City Manager Seminoff explained that the grant funds emergency shelter operating costs (e.g., food) and workforce development for staff. Many staff are former guests. The city increased pay rates and this funding provides additional training.</li>
<li><strong>Questions:</strong><ul>
<li>Councillor Wilson requested to visit the shelter.</li>
<li>Councillor Zusy asked about the grant application process (city typically applies, but this was a result of repeated requests for state funding after the city took over funding).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Motion:</strong> Councillor Wilson moved to approve the appropriation and place Item 6 on file.</li>
<li><strong>Vote:</strong><ul>

<li><strong>Item 9: Cambridge Out-of-School Time (OST) Expansive Study Report</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong> Councillor Wilson appreciated the study and asked Assistant City Manager Seminoff to highlight key recommendations.<ul>
<li><strong>Response:</strong> Assistant City Manager Seminoff highlighted five key recommendations:<ol>
<li>Adequate space for OST programs, requiring deep work with schools.</li>
<li>Appropriate pay and benefits for staff to improve recruitment and retention.</li>
<li>Increased support for children with special needs, including additional staff and a trial run program.</li>
<li>Unified application process for city and non-profit OST programs.</li>
<li>Deeper partnerships between school staff and OST staff.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Questions:</strong><ul>
<li>Councillor Zusy asked about surprises in the report (staff culture was more important than expected) and the gap in serving 369 children (not fully filled, focus on special needs first).</li>
<li>Councillor Siddiqui requested an update on the inclusion of students with disabilities at a future Human Services meeting.</li>
<li>Vice Mayor McGovern asked for data on the percentage of low-income children served compared to those who applied (most low-income children who apply are served if space is available).</li>
<li>Councillor Nolan asked about learnings from other communities (Cambridge serves a higher percentage of students than most, and struggles are similar across communities).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Motion:</strong> Councillor Wilson moved to refer Item 9 to the Human Services and Veterans Committee.</li>
<li><strong>Vote:</strong> Unanimous Ayes.</li>
<li><strong>Outcome:</strong> Item 9 referred to the Human Services and Veterans Committee.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Item 10: Executive Summary of the City's Community Benefits Advisory Committee's Work</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong> Vice Mayor McGovern asked for highlights and addressed former Councillor Carlone's concern about infrastructure funding.<ul>
<li><strong>Response:</strong> Assistant City Manager Seminoff explained that the Community Benefits Ordinance does not allow funds for infrastructure, a choice made to prioritize funding for non-profit partnerships delivering services. The committee, comprising 13 members, conducted a needs assessment and focused on low-income families with services for housing, financial, and mental health instability. Four partnerships were funded, including Families Moving Forward, Family Stability Project, Port Arise Institute, and Strengthening Families Together. Key learnings included the critical role of case management, improved family well-being, and the value of partnerships.</li>
<li><strong>Questions:</strong><ul>
<li>Councillor Siddiqui suggested discussing changes to the ordinance at a future Human Services meeting, including direct cash to families.</li>
<li>Councillor Zusy asked about the source of the $8.6 million (Volpe project and Alexandria rezoning) and why past infrastructure projects (e.g., 585 Third Street, Moderna/MXD) were not funded through this ordinance. Assistant City Manager Seminoff clarified that the ordinance was designed to streamline non-profit funding, separate from city-related infrastructure or developer commitments.</li>
<li>Councillor Wilson expressed concern about the urgency of needs for non-profits like East End House and the slow pace of city processes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Motion:</strong> Vice Mayor McGovern moved to refer Item 10 to the Human Services and Veterans Committee.</li>
