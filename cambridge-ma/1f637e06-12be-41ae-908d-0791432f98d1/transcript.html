                <td> Thank you, thank you. Good evening, city council members. My name is Alex, this is my wife, Siyu. We are the owner and occupants of 49 Alpine Street. We firstly sincerely thank the city council for approving our curb cut application last week. So today we&#39;re here to just make some clarifications to a few points raised during the last week&#39;s discussion. The first one is, I want to mention, according to the Cambridge official curb cut application guidance, the abutters of the property are defined as owners directly touching or opposite our property. For 49 Alpine Street, this includes the 43 on the left, 55 on the right, 48 across, and Tobin School directly behind. All of this for direct neighbors, we have full approval of our curb cut, which is 75%. Over this weekend and including today, we have received an additional number of strong supports of neighbors who reside on Albany Street if we&#39;re to believe some of your city council members also received the email as well. Secondly, we very much appreciate Councillor Nolan&#39;s suggestion to reconsider a broader group beyond just immediate neighbors. So even expand to eight neighbors, so two on the left, two on the right, and one diagonal cross and another one diagonal cross, there&#39;s eight properties. Of the eight, five gave us a formal approval letter. That is 62% approval. Further expansion beyond these eight properties seems unnecessary for me because this is not intended as a popularity vote. Thirdly, just to clarify, during last week&#39;s meeting, a claim was made by a neighborhood association, Mr. Doug Brown. I think Councillor Zusy brought up his claim that only three out of the 20 homes have curb cuts on Alpine Street. Yesterday, I had a very good pleasure to walk with Councillor Zusy. I&#39;m sure we have currently more than three there. I counted later, there&#39;s about 16 curb cuts on Alpine Street, 10 north of Concord Avenue, and six south of Concord Avenue. Really? So thank you very much for your attention.</td>

                <td>Good evening, council members. My name is Siyu. Great to meet you here. I&#39;m here to share more about the background of our family and this property. So we&#39;re a multi-generational household. My husband and I live with two young children and our elderly parents. So it&#39;s eight people in the household. My mother has a significant vision impairment due to age-related mycology generation and a past trauma resulting in severe strabismus and over minus 1,200 degree of nearsightedness. She has fallen downstairs in our current house in Cambridge three times in recent years and once while holding my son in her arm. So it&#39;s actually quite severe damage to her body and even my son. at that time. My husband Alex has undergone four knee surgery procedures in the past year, with the most recent surgery was just two weeks ago, and his doctor have advised him to avoid stairs as much as possible to support both my mother and my husband. We have designed the ADA accessible path from the street to our front door. And we know there are questions about children&#39;s safety in riding bikes, and I firmly believe that, because we are the parents for two kids, and we also have other kids in the neighborhood, we have surveyed all the parents, and they actually, some of them, they even wrote letters to the counselor that they believe curb cars enhance the safety, actually, for children, particularly for those cycling activities, that they help minimize street-side congestion and improve visibility. The curb cut is not just a convenience. It&#39;s a necessity for our families&#39; safety, mobility, and well-being. It&#39;s what allows us to create a home where our family can age in place with dignity. As someone committed to sustainability, I also plan to enhance our landscape with trees and native plantings that will thrive for decades to come. And I know Cambridge has always been supporting with value and exclusivity and accessibility. We really wanted to bring this to many generations to come and also bring sustainability to the neighborhood.</td>

                <td>Thank you. Good evening, Mayor Simmons, Vice Mayor McGovern, and the rest of the City Council. My name is Jeff Olinger and I live at 216 Prospect Street and I represent Olinger Architects who designed 49 Alpine Street and is currently assisting the owners in their curb cut application. I&#39;m here to provide clarification regarding the recently approved curb cut application for 49 Alpine Street, which received the council&#39;s approval last week. In response to Councilor Zusy&#39;s suggestion of a side yard or one car driveway, the new home is built on the same foundation and footprint as the previous existing structure. That means that the site that it sits the building only seven and a half feet away from the property line and does not permit to have a legal driveway on the side of the building. We would have loved to have used that opportunity because we would have liked to have used the front yard for a more charitable purpose. The proposed curb cut also will allow for a oak tree in the front yard to now be exposed to the street. So in fact, the front yard will be providing a large new mature street tree to the public realm. We believe that the additional curb cut will also achieve the ADA accessibility requirements for the owners and allow for them to have their multi-generational family live with the building that they&#39;ve invested so much in the neighborhood with. Thank you.</td>

                <td> Good evening to everybody. Thank you for letting us share our thoughts today. I just wanted to summarize and reiterate some of the points that my clients and Jeff have already made. Jeff has done a wonderful job designing this property to be beautiful and aesthetic and pleasing. And this curb cut is integral to that. They&#39;re going to have a beautifully landscaped front area, pavers, preserving the tree. That was always one of the goals for Alex and TU. It was really something that we thought was an important part of the character of the house and something that we&#39;ve planned around and really want to keep there for the neighborhood. A concern that some people might have would be storm water management. We&#39;ve heard that raised. I wanted to point out that we&#39;ve vastly improved the drainage of this home by adding two large coal tech chambers into the front. So there&#39;s actually no runoff gonna be coming from this property. All of the gutters, all of the drains from the roof are all directed into the coal techs and discharged that way. The pavers that we&#39;re applying are gonna be a permeable paver. Um, and really, you know, go into that same storm water system. So I know that might be something some of the neighbors are anxious about, but that is a concern that Jeff and the civil engineering team have addressed well in advance. Um, I also wanted to reiterate. Many of the houses on this street already have a curb cut 16 to 17 of the other properties. And our opinion, we&#39;re improving the parking for the neighborhood by removing more cars from the street than we are removing street spots available for people to park in. So we see this as overall a net benefit to the neighborhood. And we appreciate everyone&#39;s support with this application. Thank you very much.</td>

                <td> Thank you. Good evening. Denise Gilson. I&#39;m the executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association. And I&#39;m here tonight to ask for your support for POR number 71, which supports the appropriation of $72,000 for an RFP toward the development of an engineering study that will guide the transformation and repurposing of an abandoned MBTA tunnel beneath the streets of Harvard Square. We&#39;ve been working on this project for a very long time and are pleased that we are now in a position to move it forward. We sincerely appreciate the council&#39;s leadership in this matter and thank all of you as well as the city manager for the time he&#39;s already spent with us on this issue. To fund the RFP, I respectfully request that the TPT&#39;s $300,000 pedestrian study be scaled back to allow for the funding of the RFP, with remaining monies to be used for the study, as well as the curation and programming required for successful street closures. The HSBA has supported appropriate pedestrianization for over two decades. We were instrumental in the development of Winthrop Street in 2006 as a pedestrian friendly street with the daily schedule of closing the street to vehicular traffic. We would like to implement a similar program for Palmer Street and look forward to the completion of its construction project at the end of this year. We&#39;re also envisioning a comparable program for Dunster Street when the kiosk plaza is completed. Last week, Councilor Nolan, Board Chair Jessica Scully and I walked the square to share ideas and look at the challenges. The HSBA&#39;s understanding of the cadence of the square is unparalleled. Our knowledge along with expertise from city departments like TPT and CDD in your vision can make additional appropriate pedestrianization a reality. In summary, a scaled-back study will allow for the RFP to be funded with monies left over for the curation and programming of a more pedestrian-friendly Harvard Square, which we are fully committed to and would love to program something as early as this summer. Thank you very much.</td>

                <td> Hi, I&#39;m speaking with regard to city manager&#39;s agenda federal update. So the things that I was particularly concerned about in recent changes in federal funding, that the budget for next year, the HUD budget is scheduled to, the White House is proposing to cut it from $77 billion to $43.5 billion. and about 26.7 billion would come from cuts in rental assistance programs and in pushing it back to the states. And so this is something that is on the radar. I strongly support the work by some counselors in putting together municipal vouchers. These are issues that could be coming much sooner than we would hope. And so to think about how to make the budget that is being voted on now resilient to such drastic changes without causing residents who depend on Cambridge Housing Authority federal funding to become homeless. And the second issue related to HUD is that the federal budget is cutting particularly the fair housing enforcement And I suggest that we figure out how on the local level we can support more of our tenants in asserting their civil rights, whether it be through MCAT or equivalent, particularly by providing vouchers for private attorneys to help these tenants, whether it&#39;s through MCAT or through the Superior Court. It&#39;s really important to pick up the slack where the where the federal government has chosen to target specific populations. Thank you for considering this as part of the budget for next year and the federal update. Thank you.</td>

                <td> Good evening, Madam Mayor, members of the council. For the record, my name is Sean Hope. I operate a business at 33 Church Street. I&#39;m here tonight to address policy order number 71 that was referenced earlier. This is about an allocation of funds toward what I believe is a pretty significant project in Harvard Square. Briefly, for the last five years, I&#39;ve operated a myriad of businesses in Harvard Square. They&#39;ve all been experiential in nature. I&#39;ve had an arcade. I&#39;m currently operating a nightclub at 33 Dunster Street. So I spent a lot of time seeing patterns of development, of behavior, of people walking around. This past Saturday, we had a block party. We had about 6,000 people. It was a vintage clothing and music block party. So I&#39;ve really been focused on trying to activate areas that I&#39;ve been in, and Harvard Square has really become home for the last five years. And then when I think about this potential study, this tunnel, I&#39;ve been in the tunnel. It is amazing. When I look at it, all I see is opportunities within the built environment. It&#39;s really challenging to find more space in a city as dense as Cambridge. So I see this as an opportunity to explore. I think it&#39;s a great use of resources. But I&#39;m hoping that this is the first step for the council, first to do the research to see what the opportunities are. But I really feel like this is an opportunity for Cambridge and maybe one of our historic squares to look towards the future. If you look at Assembly Row, if you look at the Seaport, these all have kind of anchor opportunities and open spaces and something unique to draw them there. As a person who&#39;s trying to advocate for more people to come to Harvard Square on a Saturday, I think these are one of the steps that is really forward-looking, and I think it&#39;s something that the council should continue to do. I also just want to say thank you. I&#39;ve opened three businesses in the last three years, and I have received funding from initiatives from this council, from CDD, from the city manager&#39;s office. So I think the council is doing a great job at promoting business, and this is just another step, but I think it&#39;s an important one and a bold one. Thank you.</td>

And I&#39;m here this evening in support of policy order 71. The order&#39;s request for an appropriation to develop the RFP for the tunnel engineering study is both modest and essential. This is a critical first step toward reimagining this unused MBTA tunnel as a people-centered hub, one that can knit the square together and create a weatherproof public space. The tunnel study is the kind of bold planning that could allow Cambridge to be at the forefront of urban innovation. The funds are already available. The recent budget&#39;s already earmarked $300,000 for a pedestrian traffic study in Harvard Square, and dedicating $72,000 of that to the RFP would keep the project on schedule without impacting any other priority. Inviting, well-programmed public spaces are the glue that binds Harvard Square&#39;s eclectic mix of residents, students, workers, and visitors into a true community. Active public realms make the square safer and more accessible for people of all ages and abilities. And culturally, these spaces become stages for the city&#39;s creativity, potentially showcasing everything from student ensembles to neighborhood festivals, and reinforcing Cambridge&#39;s reputation as a global innovation hub that values human connection. Investing in welcoming public spaces in Harvard Square is not just a local amenity. It&#39;s a citywide strategy for economic vitality, social cohesion, and sustainable growth. and Harvard Square cannot afford to stand still. Other districts in our region are already developing these human-centered spaces, and if we want the square to remain vibrant, competitive, and welcoming, we&#39;ve got to create that future today. So let&#39;s put the remaining traffic study funds to work, programming new pedestrianized moments right away, building on our wildly successful street closures of Oktoberfest and Mayfair to show residents and visitors and investors what a people-first Harvard Square feels like. Thank you. Thank you for your testimony.</td>

                <td>Good morning. My name is Kaylee Hassan, or good evening, sorry. My name is Kaylee Hassan. I live at 19 Orange Street. I&#39;m speaking in support of the third policy order resolution on today&#39;s agenda that the city council go on record to support the Clean Slate bills and the Clean Slate campaign in Massachusetts. I&#39;m a student at Harvard Law School, and I&#39;m part of Harvard Defenders in the Prison Legal Assistance Project, where I&#39;ve worked with clients who are currently or formerly incarcerated and clients who have criminal records. I&#39;m speaking in my personal capacity this evening based on my experiences and my belief that everyone deserves a fair chance to contribute positively to their community. This year, I&#39;ve helped several clients with the criminal offender record information or quarry sealing process. Having a criminal record negatively impacts our clients&#39; job, housing, and community engagement opportunities. For example, having a criminal record makes you ineligible to volunteer at your child&#39;s school or go on field trips, leading to intergenerational effects for the 50% of children in the United States who have a parent with a criminal record. For many folks, these are charges that are eligible to be sealed. Their cases were resolved the requisite three or seven years earlier. However, the sealing process itself poses needless administrative barriers. There is often a months-long backlog to review sealing petitions. THAT MEANS THAT, FOR EXAMPLE, ONE OF OUR CLIENTS COULD APPLY FOR HOUSING BUT THEIR APPLICATION WOULD BE REJECTED BECAUSE OF THEIR CRIMINAL RECORD. EVEN IF THEY WERE ELIGIBLE FOR COREY CEILING, IT MAY TAKE FOUR TO SIX MONTHS FOR THEIR PETITION TO BE REVIEWED. THAT IS FOUR TO SIX MONTHS BEFORE THEIR HOUSING APPLICATION CAN GET APPROVED. THAT&#39;S WHY AUTOMATED CEILING IS SO IMPORTANT. I also want to bring up that charges that end in dismissals or charges that are dropped still go on a criminal record and are not immediately sealed. The clean slate bills would change all of these issues. That&#39;s why I hope that the city council votes to approve the resolution to support the clean slate bills. Thank you.</td>

                <td> Thank you. Good evening, mayor, vice mayor, and counselors. Thank you for the opportunity to speak here. I&#39;m here speaking regarding policy order 71. My name is John DiGiovanni. I&#39;m with Trinity Properties that&#39;s been active in Harvard Square for over 70 years. And I would also like to thank the city manager for his time over the past two years. As many of you know, he is skeptical about the ability to develop the tunnel into a venue. I appreciate his skepticism and his innate determination to be frugal with public funds. However, there are a variety of reasons why it&#39;s worth spending these initial investment dollars. To mention a few, ticketed venues are the new anchors for districts. Harvard Square&#39;s conservation district and its built environment limits the ability to create venues of this size. We&#39;re late. Other districts are doing this. The tunnel sits below a city street and abuts a city parking lot. It&#39;s been vacant for 45 years. Approximately 35 years ago, this site next to the tunnel, the hotel, was fully permitted to come down. and they were using this, they were gonna use the tunnel for parking. So we know you can access this tunnel. We&#39;ve been exploring this for about 10 years. We&#39;ve spent funds, the association has, for a 3D Reddit computer imaging of this tunnel. We&#39;ve been in there several times. In February of 2020, we met with city leaders and several property owners to outline a plan to begin this investigation. Since then, we lost three years to the pandemic. We&#39;re spending the last couple of years working with the city manager. The time is now. The amount of time that it will take to actually get someone to write the RFP, to write the RFP, to issue the RFP, and someone to actually come back and tell you how much time and resources it&#39;s going to take to answer the fundamental questions, which is, can you access it from a public way? And what&#39;s the capacity? You find those out, you&#39;ll find out whether it&#39;s economically viable. It&#39;s a worthwhile investment. This city is a leader in innovative thinking. I&#39;d hope you see this as an investment to be transformative to an important economic engine for the city. Thank you.</td>

I live at 125 Ridge Avenue in Cambridge, and I&#39;m the director of the Corey and Rianti Project at Greater Boston Legal Services, which has an office in Boston as well as in Cambridge. So I&#39;m here to speak on the third policy proposal, which would be to endorse clean slate legislation. Where I work at GBLS, we have the oldest criminal record sealing process in in the entire state. And day after day, what we&#39;ve seen over the years is the current system really fails people. It&#39;s plagued with backlogs, which can be as many as like six or seven months to seal a record, which you wait years to seal because there are three-year waiting periods for misdemeanors, and seven-year waiting periods for felonies. So people have done their time, they&#39;ve finished their sentences, it&#39;s been many, many years, but there&#39;s a real difficulty with the current sealing process. So what other states have done is they&#39;ve found a way to resolve the problem of backlogs and also underutilization because the current rules are so complicated that frankly, even attorneys call me up to figure out when their clients are eligible. So it&#39;s not unusual for us to have clients. Sometimes they&#39;ll come into the office and they&#39;ll have offenses that are 20 years old. So Massachusetts should join the other states, which are Pennsylvania, Connecticut, New Jersey, New York, California, Colorado, Delaware. Michigan, Oklahoma, Virginia, Minnesota, and Utah who have passed Clean Slate legislation. So I urge this body to do the same. Everybody deserves a chance to work and support their family and to participate in their communities. And Clean Slate would do exactly that if it was enacted. Thank you.</td>

During that time, we passed an upzoning cost reimbursement benefit. For any upzoning, a certain amount of money would be charged per square foot, which then went back into the community. The reason I&#39;m bringing this up, there&#39;s an excellent handout by the manager, 212. which talks about the Community Benefits Advisory Committee and the wonderful four projects that were funded. I understand that the upzoning payments to the public are now under the Community Benefits Advisory Committee. That was not the intent of the nine zero approved ordinance order, excuse me. The order states, and you have a copy, the additional value created for the owner petitioner by upzonings for development of more than 50,000 square feet, along with the recommendation of proportional contributions from said property owner petitioner towards development impact mitigation infrastructure improvements, community public benefits, and or fulfilling city council goals projects. The reason I bring that up is that is not the order of the community benefits advisory committee. There can be no infrastructure improvements. It is not allowed. Now, a building is permanent.</td>

I direct the Safety Net Project and the Criminal Record Sealing Initiative and have done so since 2019. I&#39;m speaking on my own behalf and based on my own experience doing that work. And we&#39;ll note that both Ms. Hassan and Attorney Kurian have already spoken. eloquently in support of policy order number three, which is the policy order that I&#39;m speaking about in support of. Since 2019, I have worked with well over 120 people and have helped them move on from law enforcement encounters that have led to their being denied opportunities like new apartments, educational opportunities, job opportunities. The reason that we&#39;re asking the Cambridge City Council to support policy order number three and to advance the clean slate legislation across the state is because there is reluctance. in many quarters to say yes to folks who&#39;ve had law enforcement encounters. There is concern about the prospect of a sealed criminal records And having the City Council carefully consider this policy order, carefully consider this legislation and support the advancement of this legislation goes a long way to allaying those concerns across the state. And so again, as I&#39;ll remind you about the eloquent testimony you&#39;ve already heard from others supporting this policy order and urge you to do so and support our clean slate legislation that will permit folks to move on from these encounters and will permit them to hear yes instead of no on the basis of a criminal record. Thank you very much. Thank you for your testimony.</td>

My name is Otoniel Figueroa Duran. I am the Director of Employee Relations for 32BJ, a union representing 185,000 service workers in 14 states, including 20,000 here in Massachusetts. We currently represent the cleaners in Cambridge City buildings employed by a contractor called Compass Facility Services. A number of them have joined me here today. The city recently issued a request for proposal for cleaning services starting this year through 2028. The RFP specified that the service contract would be awarded to the lowest responsive and responsible bidder. When the bids were recently opened, a company called New England Facility Services, NEFS, was the lowest by a very slight amount. However, based on our recent experiences with the company, 32BJ has serious doubt that they can be considered responsible. NEFS has not demonstrated an ability to meet its legal obligation under the National Labor Relations Act. They recently took over another account at Boston South Station with a unionized cleaning workforce. For four months, they have refused to recognize and to bargain with the union. It has resulted in the union filing charges, unfair labor practice charges, at the federal level against that NEFS, which is in pending investigation. NEFS has demonstrated that it&#39;s neither in fact responsive or responsible and it should not be considered eligible for this contract award. The Purchasing Department of Cambridge should be encouraged to choose a responsible contractor. We urge you to vote yes on Policy Order 78. Thank you. And thank you for your testimony.</td>

I&#39;m testifying tonight as the Director of CEOC on City Manager Agenda Item 10 regarding the work of the Community Benefits Advisory Committee&#39;s work. CEOC was fortunate enough to participate in one of the four partnerships, the Family Stability Project, along with De Novo and Transition House. Although all of our agencies had strong working relationships before the project, the community benefits funding allowed us to create a no-wrong-door approach for residents seeking services from any of our organizations. This was incredibly important, especially during the pandemic. We were able to design a comprehensive intake process that was conducted at the initial visit to screen for a multitude of issues that the family was dealing with. This enhanced the capacity to work collaboratively and make successful referrals to each of our agencies and to the other partnerships. We were able to develop a data system to track the number of individual serves, the type of services that they received, and at which agency. And working with the committee and an evaluation partner, they assisted us to measure our outcomes. We&#39;re continuing to use all these tools. What was also critical about the funding for this project was the fact that it allowed for a multi-year intervention. For families to have success in maintaining housing stability, to move forward in economic mobility, and to address mental and behavioral health issues, it often takes an intensive process that is multifaceted, flexible, and addresses the individual needs of the family. This funding made that possible. We&#39;re happy to share additional information with the council to give you more details about the project, but tonight we want to thank the committee for giving our agencies the ability to participate in this effort. Thank you.</td>

Tonight I want to clarify some facts and details surrounding the curb cut application at 49 Alpine Street. This information is different from what you&#39;ve heard from the owners and their supporters so far this evening. There are 17 houses and one and two family houses on Alpine Street between Concord Ave and Vassal Lane. Bill Simmers is on the southeast corner of Vassal Lane and Alpine Street, and he lives at 8 Alpine Street. Nancy Menzen is at the opposite end of Alpine Street and she lives at 56 Alpine Street. Both of them have written letters in opposition. I hope you&#39;ll read them. Nancy wrote an eloquent letter and referenced the historical value of our street. I hope you&#39;ll make a special point of reading her letter. There are 11 homeowners on our street wrote thoughtful letters opposing the curb cut. Now onto the abutting neighbors. Four abutting neighbors were asked by the city to weigh in on this curb cut. Two of the abutting neighbors Noam Kersom and Robert Filene opposed, I&#39;m sorry, were in favor of the curb cut. Two opposed the curb cut. They are Ann Robart and myself, Elizabeth Marin. We are, as far as I know, the four people, the abutting neighbors who were asked by the city. Ms.</td>

I feel like there&#39;s a lot more important things to be doing. But we&#39;re here for the moment because this is still in your purview. And this is the body that&#39;s supposed to pay attention to what neighbors care about as opposed to the staff who approve things in a different way. I live right beside 49. I am opposed as are most of the neighbors. And counselors may not have known before now that some of the letters that they received in support are from people who don&#39;t live on the block or even on the street. The block we&#39;re talking about runs between Concord Ave and Vassell. One abutter is supporting it, three are opposed. Of the people on the block, two who live there support it. You have 10 letters in opposition. The applicants have been counting another block of alpine on the other side of Concord Ave. And the blocks were built at very different times in Cambridge history. My block used to be a brickyard. It was a clay ground. It was built post-war. Anyway, so the houses are situated very differently. The other block has driveways, our block has not. Until very recent years, we only had three curb cuts, and those were because of city easements, minus one of them. Now we have a couple of more. Most houses do not have room on the side for a driveway, they don&#39;t have room in the front, and this application is a cut to drive two cars in and parallel to the front of their house in what would be the garden. I don&#39;t want this to be a precedent. Over time, a house is sold, the buyers seek to get a curb cut, and park privately in front. Ms.</td>

We are in a moment of transition that is true, but it&#39;s not a transition where we pause, reflect, make thoughtful decisions. We&#39;re in a moment of transition where we have a lot of unanswered questions and we are working extra hard to do the work of the commission and to keep it running. I&#39;m asking for two things here tonight. One is that instead of questioning our existence right now, you&#39;re free to do so later, but just not right now. Instead, I&#39;m asking that you would support us and you would support us by passing the budget that&#39;s been proposed. I&#39;m asking that you would also find ways to support us or either stand aside and allow the city manager to support us because he has. He&#39;s even come to our meeting. He&#39;s thanked our peace commissioners for the work that they do. All of that has been received very, very well. Second, I&#39;m asking that before you call our commission redundant or not a priority, that you would learn who we are and what we do. The person best equipped to do that is Brian, but he&#39;s not here and you know that. And so I&#39;m here to offer myself. I&#39;m second rate Brian. I&#39;m happy to talk to you about what we do. If after that you decide we&#39;re redundant, not necessary, so be it. But I&#39;m simply asking that right now we need your support. Thank you. Thank you for your testimony.</td>

                <td> I am Bill Summers. I live at 8 Alpine Street, which is at the other end of the portion of Alpine Street between Concord and Massalane. I really want to speak up mainly. I am an architect, so I may be more visually attuned to what&#39;s going on, but I&#39;m really upset about the fact that this whole curb cut situation is an interruption to the consistency of the street to which practically all of the people on the street really adhere to. It has been historically a very integrated unit with very consistent designs and particularly the design of the front yards. So I am very leery of this lengthy driveway experience does show that when you make a lengthy driveway, you&#39;re going to fill it up regardless of how close it is to the front lot line. And so I would urge people to understand that people on this particular segment of the street are very passionate about how the consistency and the neighborhood feeling of the street. And I feel like the parking in front of the house is not the way to go. That&#39;s all I have to say. Thank you. Thank you very much.</td>

                <td>Thank you. Suzanne Blier, Five Fuller Place, and there&#39;s several things that I want to talk about. One is the Harvard Square tunnel and Charter Right. I&#39;m speaking now both as myself and for the Harvard Square Neighborhood Association in support of this. I think it would be a really terrific thing to look at and part of a key vision for the square and for the city. And I urge the funding of it and the creation ultimately of a citywide committee to look into questions about its use. We also support even more streets opening to pedestrians year-round every week, and hopefully we can work on that as well. And first floor retail citywide and that coming before the city again. Right now, if you want to put retail in your building, you can do it. You can simply write that in. But I hope this will go to neighborhood and long-term planning because there are impacts on water and electricity, noise, parking, etc. Solar energy systems matter. Please support them. It should have been as part of the upzoning, not, but it&#39;s critical. And on the federal issues manager, agenda number one and the finance committee, boy, are we seeing cuts? I mean, massive. And I speak of this from experience. And right now the city has to step up. I mean, we&#39;re talking really important, really serious ones that are gonna impact housing needs and money coming into the city by way of revenue, etc. And you can&#39;t simply level that on the shoulders of current residents. So please do that. Dennis Carlone&#39;s statement seemed to make very good sense. I wasn&#39;t aware of that. And as a spouse of an SEIU shop steward, I also think that what they had said also makes good sense. So thank you very much.</td>

I hope that all counselors and many residents will attend one of the showings of the film, Where Do Black Men Live? On May 29th at six at the main library, June 19th at 11 at the Brattle Theater, followed by a Juneteenth celebration on the Cambridge Common. or on June 26th at 6 p.m. on Zoom. The Cambridge Residence Alliance has worked closely for several years with the Black Response in the Cambridge Housing Justice Coalition, and we deeply appreciate their contributions to Cambridge. We also support Policy Order No. 3 to support the Clean Slate Bill for automated sealing of records. Thank you.</td>

First of all, I&#39;d like to correct the written material that we got said that of the five immediate abutters, it said that three were... I&#39;m sorry, they left me out. Okay, it said that of the five, there were four who were in favor, but that&#39;s not true because of the five immediate abutters, one does not live here. So of the four immediate abutters... there&#39;s there are three opposed including myself and i will say as respectfully as i can that i think it was really a bit disingenuous to include the other block of alpine street which really resembles ours not at all it might as well be somewhere else because this street has an interesting historical history that bill simmers alluded to these houses were all built post-war somewhere i thought i heard gi housing i&#39;m not sure of that piece uh but they were all there there are only three models of house original models on the street and they all have small frontages and small side sideages if you will And I would really invite you all to come take a walk down Alpine Street because I think it may be unique in Cambridge with the way people have taken these three models of house and made them a little individual and planted. What I invite you to see is how lovely this street has become over the years. It was a development in 1948 and a brick yard, as Bill Simmer said.</td>

And what Lee Ferris said, especially about the value to our city of the Black Response Cambridge and the way it has spoken out. I could not be more appreciative of what they have done to bring a different voice to city decisions. With respect to sealing records, I could not say it better than others have before me. With respect to first floor retail, I&#39;m pleased to see that there&#39;s a proposal to change this, but I wish that all of you would realize that one size fits all, is a dumb way to run a city this size. In fact, there are differences. You just heard it about Alpine Street a bunch of times, and that&#39;s two blocks. How about when you spread that over a more than six square mile city? It&#39;s small, but it&#39;s not that small. So please, please, you are running into the results of your unthinking adoption of foolish zoning petitions. We&#39;re gonna see that tomorrow. But finally, with respect to the budget, I hope that you will think long and hard about what we really need to spend money on and what we could stand to not. And I&#39;d suggest screwing up linear parks would be a good thing to think about not doing.</td>

                <td> UH GOOD EVENING MADAM MAYOR AND REST OF THE COUNCIL GOOD TO BE WITH YOU JUST REALLY QUICKLY I I&#39;D AGREE WITH TABA RICHARD HODDEN REPRESENTING GREEN SOLE CANNABIS UM I THINK THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT ARE BEING MADE TONIGHT THAT UH FOR THE CHANGES IN REPACKAGING WILL UM FOR ONE BRING UP THE CITY WITH THE CANNABIS COMMISSION WHICH I THINK It&#39;s something we should always watch about while we&#39;re in the hearing sometimes and the councils are asking what could help operators be more profitably and more efficient. It&#39;s catching up with the regulations that the CCC recommends as it relates to cannabis as this is their full-time thing. So I just want to thank Christina DeLeoso and her group for advocating and paying attention to this important piece of the retail cannabis industry. I&#39;d also say that I think the council has made a will make a huge step by removing the obstacle of the HCA as it relates to new businesses opening. It&#39;s one of the hardest. It was at one time one of the biggest obstacles to negotiate an HCA with the city. Cambridge has been pretty good about it, but I think moving in this direction will allow more people to be able to take a calculated chance at getting into the business without having to go through the long, arduous process of negotiating the HCA. So I just want to thank the council and those who are working on this particular issue, and I hope that they would vote in favor of the changes proposed tonight. Thank you. Have a great evening.</td>

I think you and I are the only two still around then when we changed our rules to say that if you were on the losing side of a vote, you can&#39;t automatically file for reconsideration. You needed to move suspension first. And the reason we did that was because there were People were filing reconsiderations a lot when they were on the losing side of the vote to basically get a second bite at the apple. And it was not a productive use of time and so I never vote for reconsideration when that&#39;s the case. I think it&#39;s consistent, I support the rule that we have. and especially when I don&#39;t really think there&#39;s any new information to be had. So I will be voting no on suspension.</td>

                <td>Thank you. Through you, Mayor Simmons, I wanted to provide a brief overview of some of the federal funding impacts and also an update on how we are processing the potential for interactions between federal ICE operations and local police, as we saw in Worcester over the last week. On federal funding impacts, we are tracking the impact of federal funding cuts in our community, and some of the greatest impacts have continued to center on Harvard and MIT. Harvard University is now up to $3 billion of federal grants frozen or canceled. That&#39;s billion with a B. with over 100 termination notices sent to researchers last Thursday alone. Though it&#39;s uncertain how much of this total funding is tied up in various court challenges, this is nonetheless an enormous impact. And there have been real impacts on faculty, staff, and students as major ongoing research projects are left in an uncertain position. Harvard announced a hiring freeze on March 10th, and some initial layoffs have already occurred within areas most affected by federal grant freezes, particularly at the School of Public Health. In response, Harvard has also taken significant financial actions to support existing operations and research, including issuing a $750 million bond to raise cash and allocating $250 million from their central budget to support ongoing research. My sense is that we are still waiting to understand the scale of the short-term impact, but that the long-term impact on research, careers, and our local economy will be substantial if the worst case funding cuts are made permanent. MIT is in a similar position, though they have been not quite in the bullseye. MIT placed a hiring freeze on February 14th and has received at least 20 stop work orders for federally funded research grants. Over the past two weeks, as Councilor Nolan noted, there have been dozens of staff layoffs as the Institute is seeking to stabilize its overall funding and ensure that it has financial flexibility moving forward. The Institute has also issued a $750 million bond to raise cash, similar to Harvard, and is involved as well in litigation regarding attempts by the National Science Foundation to slash funding for facilities and administrative costs as part of federal grants. At the state level, the Healey administration has published dashboard over the weekend of the $360 million of federal grants that have been frozen or canceled to the state thus far. The largest cuts have been to the pandemic elementary and secondary school emergency relief fund, ESSER funding of about $100 million. Two thirds of that funding really impacted two school districts, Springfield and New Bedford. The other major grant that was frozen or terminated was $90 million for climate resilience infrastructure through the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities grants. But there are potentially a number of smaller grant cuts that we will seek to better understand in terms of the local impact, including grants on digital equity, community mental health services, food insecurity, and public health initiatives. Some of these grants are in active litigation, but the economic uncertainty driven by federal funding cuts, tariffs, and broader market upheaval has also led the state to implement a hiring freeze that will start next week on May 27th. I believe that our actions thus far remain consistent with these challenges. And while our financials are somewhat more insulated from these major impacts, we will continue to monitor and make recommendations to the city council if a more conservative approach will be required as we enter FY26. On local police interactions with ICE, I wanted to address some of the issues that we saw, particularly as the city manager of Worcester released body camera footage from the encounter that unfolded last week. That body camera footage really did feel important for the community in terms of providing greater transparency into how things unfolded, though it was very difficult to watch. A woman was detained in front of her daughters and a crowd of community members surrounded the operation in protest of the federal action. The Worcester Police Department was called through 911, responded, and ultimately sought to restore order by supporting the exit of federal agents through the crowd. During the incident, one of the daughters was arrested. The Worcester Police have since released the minor and recommended no charges be brought. i want to first clarify that similar to worcester cambridge has a welcoming cities community ordinance which states that the cambridge police department does not inquire or store information on immigration status and does not participate in enforcement for civil immigration actions However, our ordinance, similar to Worcester&#39;s, notes no officer or employee of the Cambridge Police Department may participate in an operation led by a federal agency to detain persons for deportation purposes except in response to a request to assist with support services deemed necessary to ensure officer safety or to prevent a breach of the peace during a federal operation, such as requests to establish traffic perimeters, control traffic, or provide police escort. I&#39;ve had a number of conversations with police commissioner Elo, the police leadership team and the city solicitor&#39;s office as we have wrestled with what this means in this unique and difficult time. I understand the frustration and anger in our community regarding federal actions on immigration. What we have seen over the last four months is more than simply immigration enforcement actions targeting undocumented individuals with outstanding criminal investigations or warrants. We have seen students detained for publishing op-eds critical of US foreign policy, then immediately moved out of state without informing family or lawyers. We have seen federal agencies detain people by mistake, deport them to foreign countries and then refuse to take any actions to correct the mistake even after being ordered to by the Supreme Court. We have seen social media being used selectively to identify individuals who were detained while other individuals detained were only located through the media checking the public log of detention facilities. At the highest levels, we are seeing senior federal officials speak of suspending habeas corpus, the foundational writ, the meaning show me the body that requires law enforcement to present a detained person before a judge to justify their detention. While there have been some successful court challenges, the system of checks and balances is under severe strain. It&#39;s these actions which have shattered trust in due process, the rule of law, and the legitimacy of immigration enforcement. Without trust in federal agencies, our community is living in a state of fear and uncertainty, which I know is turning into anger, activism, and a willingness to consider civil disobedience. That has put us as local government officials responsible for local law enforcement in a bind. We as a welcoming community do not support or defend this federal administration&#39;s policies on immigration enforcement. There are significant questions about whether many actions taken are legal or constitutional, and the federal government&#39;s record in court where they have lost a number of cases is reflective of the lack of trust and legitimacy in their actions. But we also have a responsibility to maintain public order and to abide by the rule of law. Some brief guidance that is important for us in our community to understand. There is significant latitude that federal agents have to detain individuals in public spaces. The threshold is probable cause in a judicial administrative warrant is only required to enter private spaces, but not to make an arrest in the public domain. Federal agents have significant latitude in how they plan and carry out operations, including whether they are wearing plain clothes or uniforms, wearing masks or not wearing masks. And a lot of that regulatory authority is out of our control as a municipality. Witnessing and documenting what is happening in public is allowed, but acts to mislead or stop a federal operation can be prosecuted, and obstructing a federal operation is a significant violation. The reality is that the path to challenging an arrest has to happen through the courts rather than on the street, and I recognize that this is where the breakdown of trust and legitimacy is what makes this moment so difficult. In the case of a significant confrontation between our local community and federal agents, I have confidence in the professionalism, the empathy and training of the Cambridge Police Department, and I know that the goal will be to communicate and to de-escalate. This is the same conversation that I know so many communities are now wrestling with, and we&#39;re also looking to coordinate across municipalities to ask for guidance from the state attorney&#39;s general&#39;s office and to ensure that we&#39;re able to communicate to our community what is happening, what the role is of local law enforcement, and how we might manage some of these really difficult interactions. Thank you all for just this space, the ability to have these kinds of difficult discussions together. And I know the police commissioner and our city solicitor are also available for this discussion.</td>

                <td> Through you, Madam Mayor. So the ICE agents do have to meet the standard of having probable cause. It&#39;s a little bit more nuanced. They also would have to have reason to believe that the person they&#39;re seeking to detain would flee if they didn&#39;t act then without a warrant. They do have to show their badges and identify themselves when asked. And I believe what the commissioner would say is, if they&#39;re communicating with federal agents, they know who is and isn&#39;t a federal agent. So if there were a situation where the police were called to respond and it was someone impersonating a federal agent, I think the police would be able to handle that.</td>

I&#39;m not sure how well known that is because on a public way, I understand we don&#39;t have as much control. However, I think that&#39;s, as the city manager alluded to and we&#39;ve all seen, that&#39;s where people have been taken and it leads to a situation that is quite troubling and scary and anyway so that&#39;s that was the main question I&#39;m I&#39;m glad to hear from it but it&#39;s the more we can let people know the equivalent of know your rights you know ask for ID and call the police who can then confirm if it&#39;s a maybe that&#39;s something to do thank you mayor Simmons council no one yields a floor vice mayor floors yours</td>

I didn&#39;t even go there. It&#39;s frightening. But I do want to make sure that we&#39;re really clear with the community about what we will and will not do. Again, I do think there&#39;s some confusion about what being a sanctuary slash welcoming city is and what we can prevent and what we can&#39;t prevent. Um, and sort of in line with that, and I, I haven&#39;t seen the body cam footage from Worcester yet, but, um, is it fair to say that we will not cooperate, our local police will not cooperate with ICE in detaining someone and, and apprehending someone. But if there is a large crowd or there&#39;s something we may be called to prevent a further disturbance, right? And I think, and again, I haven&#39;t seen the Worcester footage, so I&#39;m not defending them or not defending them. I don&#39;t, I saw a little bit on the news, but I don&#39;t, but I believe that they were called to control the crowd that was coming, right? So I just want to make sure that people, if we get called, you know, hopefully not, if we get called to do that, I don&#39;t want people interpreting that as we&#39;re helping ICE. And so can we just, can you make that distinction and can we be clear about that?</td>

And we want to be sure that we are doing everything in our power to keep members of our community safe. recognizing that I think the goal of ICE is just not obviously the Cambridge way of how we do things and we want to make sure that folks feel supported and do know their rights and do, especially if you are with your children or whatever the case may be, that that we help to kind of get the support that they need. And so I do worry about, like, can you just speak to if there are children involved, kind of what, if any, role or responsibility might the city have if there are children to be involved in a possibility of being detained?</td>

And then also, you&#39;ll note if you do watch the Worcester body camera footage, children have a greater privacy interest than adults. So for example, the body camera footage is public record, but faces of minors are blurred out to protect the minors who might be involved in any capacity.</td>

                <td>City manager? Through you, Mayor, nothing more than what I think has been publicly shared. So I think the hiring freeze is going to start on May 27th. There are ultimately some exemptions, for instance, on certain essential positions, public safety positions, I believe. But I think how it actually rolls out is probably going to be more internal and tied to specific needs. I would guess that they would have some sort of internal exemption process as well if agencies feel like they really need a certain position. But then there is a broad freeze in terms of adding new positions, backfilling positions. Just to back up on your question, I think just a clarification and Solicitor Beyer, you can probably either follow up or clarify. I think my understanding is cars are a distinct location and so they don&#39;t count in the same way as your home. So probably the highest privacy protection is if you&#39;re in your home. If you&#39;re in private property, I think there are significant protections where warrants are required for law enforcement to enter or federal agents to enter, but a car is not protected in the same way. And so there&#39;s slightly higher thresholds than if you&#39;re just standing on the sidewalk, but you aren&#39;t considered in private property when you&#39;re inside your vehicle.</td>

Yeah, I&#39;ve just been thinking a lot about the fact that we know of these cases because people happen to be around and they were in public situations, but I&#39;m sort of catching on footage, and if they hadn&#39;t been, if they&#39;d been detained in more isolated areas, this could have gotten worse. very differently or just been a lot more questions. So still thinking through all the implications of that if there isn&#39;t any notification and it sounds like we don&#39;t know if there has been. The other question I had, I was looking at our welcoming community ordinance and there&#39;s a section there on reporting that says every six months there has to be a report to the city council on the total number of ice detainers requests uh lodged with the cambridge police department i just wanted to confirm we i haven&#39;t seen those reports just wanted to confirm that&#39;s because there hasn&#39;t been any ice decrainers requests administrative warrants in the past past few years no police interactions with ice that we we&#39;re aware of solicitor bear</td>

And to me, the big takeaway was that in the same way as when you travel, you Xerox your passport, your license, your health card. and you have a copy at home and you have maybe a copy with you. If you are an immigrant that might be stopped by ICE, they encourage you to leave a copy of your papers with your family and at home so that they can help to track you down, otherwise you could get lost. And apparently they don&#39;t have to contact your family for like 10 days. So it&#39;s it would be it&#39;s really important for families again to have copies of their documentation at home Thank you.</td>

I know that our city has done a really great job of having the Know Your Rights trainings, but really thinking about having some immigration attorneys, having the police commissioner and know your rights also be at the table so we can really have a more thoughtful conversation. So that&#39;s something that we&#39;re thinking about and we&#39;ll probably try to consider to do before summer or right in the fall, I think will probably be more ideal, but just timing is pretty, It&#39;s urgent times, we understand that, and we also know that when we&#39;re trying to work with multiple stakeholders, that scheduling can be a little challenging, so it may have to be a fall conversation, but more to come on that one.

Council Wilson, just to follow up a little bit, if you decide, if you&#39;d like to have a round table, please let me know, but I&#39;d also say let&#39;s invite the school committee as well so that they can be a part of that conversation. I had a question, and it&#39;s actually from Ms. Seminoff. Apologies to catch you off guard. We&#39;re getting ready to embark on the Cambridge mayor&#39;s summer youth program, and I&#39;m just curious. We&#39;ve talked about what the schools know to do if they come into a school building. Some of our programs are run out of the school buildings, and I&#39;m just curious, will you be doing some training for the supervisors? Not so much for the students, because I don&#39;t want to scare the students, I want to make sure that they know their rights and responsibilities. But have you thought of, are we doing some training with the folks that are running those programs, those sites, particularly if they are sites? I don&#39;t know if you can do it with a business site, but are you doing it with our sites to kind of keep those adults that are taking care of those young people to know what their rights and responsibilities are?</td>

                <td> Thank you, Chief. To answer your questions, the Chief alluded to every park in the city of Cambridge. Basically, I took the the city map of all of our athletic fields. Because that was where the policy order two years ago was about athletic complexes. And every single athletic field, football field, baseball diamond, soccer field, the golf course, tennis court, big and small, will have at least one defibrillator on site. They will be there 365 days a year, 24 hours a day. They&#39;re going to be in a cabinet that is heated. climate controlled. Most of them will be in the vicinity of a police call box and they will be accessed by, you can&#39;t just open the cabinet and take the AED out, but you call 911 and I&#39;ve been able to make this happen with Christina Giacobbe at ECC. You call 911. They give you a code. It&#39;ll be a simple code. It won&#39;t be difficult. And it has a little push button combination on it. It opens up the cabinet. There&#39;ll be an AED inside. And there&#39;ll be a stop the bleed kit inside as well. The AEDs that we&#39;re looking to purchase are a new device from a company called Avive. They&#39;re unique because they have two-way communications. ECC and myself as the administrator of them can see constant data about where they are. Are they functioning properly? Is the battery charged? Are they moved? Do they have GPS? Are they being used? If they&#39;re being turned on, we will know it immediately. If they&#39;re being used, defibrillating somebody, we will know it immediately as well. There&#39;s another feature to it which we probably will not use because of our situation where there&#39;s reverse communication, meaning ECC receives a call for a cardiac arrest, let&#39;s say, at Donnelly Field. They can send an alert to the device saying there&#39;s an emergency in your area. please take this AED to the emergency, and there&#39;ll actually be a map on it which can guide you to where the emergency is, and you can use the AED. Because ours are gonna be in locked cabinets, we&#39;re probably not gonna use that feature, but it&#39;s just something else that it comes with. But basically, 46 AEDs in every city athletic field. They will not be in just playgrounds that don&#39;t have, some sort of basketball court or something, but they&#39;ll be in every athletic field in the city.</td>

It has a map of everything, has a Google Maps link where you can see all the locations, pictures of where they&#39;re going to go, et cetera. For example, Danny Park is getting three. Now, I just used my best judgment when I was planning this. A lot of the very smaller places are getting one. Places like Danahy, Hoyt Field, Hillwood Fade&#39;s getting two. Danahy&#39;s getting three. The golf course is getting four because of the large spread out location. But a lot of the places are getting multiple, the larger ones with multiple fields, et cetera.

You know and that&#39;s a you know so it&#39;s not written it. You know I It&#39;s not right next door. I don&#39;t think I could make that running back in an easy amount of time.

One of the things we&#39;re gonna do with this is educating our high school coaches, whoever uses those complexes frequently, like Ridgefield, stuff like that, letting them know that these are on site. But a sign would certainly be a good idea. I&#39;ve also had the idea of maybe, so they&#39;re gonna be too, like I said, they&#39;re gonna be heated, so they&#39;re hooked up to electricity. They&#39;re not air conditioned, they&#39;re just heated, so in the winter they&#39;re good. But two of them at the golf course will not be heated, so we&#39;re going to remove them in the winter. Technically, the course is not used in the winter anyway, so we kind of have no choice. In order to spread them out well, they can&#39;t be heated. So they&#39;re going to be on a pedestal that we&#39;re going to remove every year. And that&#39;s an option we could do for that baseball diamond or do a sign either way.

And presumably our ECC team will be so you call 911 and they can say, hey, you&#39;re really close to an AED while you&#39;re waiting, here&#39;s where you can go. So I see a nod of assent that I think that&#39;s also another important part of this communication and the training of if you&#39;re in an emergency, you&#39;re gonna be calling that 911 and if they can direct you to the nearest one, that would be a positive note of safety that will help these get used when necessary.</td>

And this funding from the state, we had assumed we would get it during the year, so we were counting on it. this money coming through. And I think the main things that the funding is going for, let me speak to the others and then to the workforce development piece, it is the funding for the food. There are all day long, the Salvation Army remains open during the day to any members of the community. You don&#39;t have to be a resident. of the Salvation Army, there&#39;s a short period in the late afternoon that they&#39;re closed, but they stay open over the course of the day. And we have staff who go in there to work with people from the Multi-Service Center to be able to work with people. We&#39;ve had folks from the Cambridge Employment Program go in there to talk. So there are a variety of services. There&#39;s a health clinic that&#39;s operated by Health Care for the Homeless. If you haven&#39;t visited the site, I would recommend that you go take a look. I was there not all that long ago, and It was actually a pretty nice atmosphere there during the day so I would encourage you to reach out to the shelter and if you want assistance you can reach out to me and our staff could go. As to workforce development, there was some additional money from the state to ensure that we could provide more training for the staff of the Salvation Army. Many of the staff are very Former guests and long time service providers when the city took it over because they were not being paid the living wage. We both needed to and wanted to increase the rates of pay, but this is also to be able to provide some more training for the staff who are there.</td>

I really want to say thank you to Kari Milner and Susan Richards of the Agenda for Children and everyone. As we look at the recommendations that are here, and of course, this is being referred to the Human Services and Veterans Committee. Myself and Vice Mayor will look forward to having this conversation when we can get it on the books, probably in the fall. But I&#39;m just curious about the recommendations that have been offered.

What would you like to highlight here if folks are not able to digest the whole packet?</td>

                <td> Through you, Madam Mayor, I think we tried to summarize, even in the city manager&#39;s letter to you, the five key recommendations, and there&#39;s obviously so much more that goes behind that. But first, as I think many of you know, adequate space for out-of-school time program. IN ORDER TO OPERATE EFFECTIVELY, OUR CURRENT SPACE IS INADEQUATE, NEVER MIND ACTUALLY EXPANDING. THAT REQUIRES DEEP WORK WITH THE SCHOOLS. Interim superintendent has expressed interest in doing that work with us and so I would say that one critical piece here is actually thinking about the spaces in the school more as our spaces rather because they are all of our children who are being served. The second is appropriate pay and benefits. One of the things that we struggle with is being able to recruit and hold onto staff, which has to do first with all the different opportunities that are out there these days, many of which allow people to be remote. If you are going to be in an out of school time program, you are going to be with young people pretty much all of the time that you are working. and the pay rates and I would say that we have over the last several years done some look at that and I would say as we do the compensation study, it is another opportunity for the city to look at those pay rates and the benefits for staff. I think we&#39;ve talked about this, Councilor Wilson, a number of times, that there are a number of children who should be able to be served in our programs, but because, and I think, Vice Mayor McGovern, you spoke about this recently, because of the nature of what the programs are like with lots more children in one space many children who can be served need more support to be in the program and so some of this is how do we make sure that we can actually get staff to be our extra staff a second thing is that it takes us and we spoke about this i think at the budget hearing We often have families who are waiting a very long time because we need to be able to see the child in the school classroom. We need to be able to meet with the parents. And there are some children where it looks like we probably could serve them. And so we are looking hire some outside staff who with expertise who could come in at the very beginning of the school year and then later when we&#39;re admitting more students later on so that we could take some children and explain to parents this is a trial run your child can come for two weeks and we will be able to work within the classroom to figure out what supports do we need? How do we support the staff who are there? And so our budget actually for this year includes some funding to allow for that. It also includes an additional inclusion support specialist because one of the complaints understandably is both the support that they provide to our classrooms as well as the interaction. So we will be hiring for that position. And so we&#39;re conscious that that will not, right now, solve the issue for every parent and their children. So there is more work to be done with the school department and with the city and our community programs to be able to figure out what can we do more. So I think that&#39;s a third recommendation. although I think we have done much better this year, the application process and the enrollment process are somewhat complicated. And we just do it now. We&#39;ve unified all of the city programs, but there are still five nonprofit programs, and you need to apply to us, you need to apply to them separately. So one of the possibilities here, again, not overnight, is could we look at, a unified application process that would allow families to be able to choose, I want this program, I want this program, I want that program, and to engage with us. We know from the Cambridge Preschool Program how complicated the system is that allows families to apply simultaneously for all these programs. So we know it&#39;s not impossible. So I think that is another thing we wanna look at. And finally, we know how busy our school teachers are and we know how busy our after school people often are, but we need to figure out ways for deeper partnerships between our school staff and our out of school time staff. We have it in some places and we need to figure out how to do better on that. So I would say that those are the big things and what leads me to be somewhat encouraged here is that the process of producing this study, at least as much as the data that you have, is that we work closely with lots of the different out of school time programs, all of the community programs, we&#39;re deeply part of this, a bunch of the principals, teachers, lots of parents, so we have a lot of people who have some engagement and I think we will need that kind of engagement to move forward.</td>

These five things are, again, as you mentioned, some stuff that we&#39;ve been talking about for a number of years. And so for them to also then elevate to be the top five here is not surprising at all. Some of which I feel might be some low-hanging fruit, and hopefully we can get some things implemented sooner versus later. I know that the space and the partnership with our Cambridge Public Schools has been often challenging and complex. And so really thinking about how do we continue to engage in that partnered conversation. And I appreciate that the signature also includes Interim Superintendent Murphy on here because it&#39;s... It just shows that there&#39;s that commitment to the partnership and trying to really remedy those needs and challenges. So I look forward again to having more deeper conversation here. And of course, as we talked about, even from my time on the school committee and having special education support committee roundtables around how do we support young people with special needs. this is like critically important like that i want us to have like as the number one thing is really how do we service and work and make sure that we have the adequate staffing so that all of our children who need access to after school programming are not kind of Restricted or just not able to kind of enroll because we don&#39;t have the staffing to get us there So again things that I know may take a little more Work and effort in terms of making sure that we have the staff like that&#39;s something you can&#39;t make up right you have to have the right number of staff to support our young people and But we really have to work on that because that is really a significant need that too many of our families are grappling with when it comes to after-school care and support for the students who may have special learning needs. So, again, I appreciate this report. Look forward to further conversations. And with that, I yield. Thank you.</td>

But it says that there are 369 kids that aren&#39;t provided for, so there&#39;s a gap of 2.1 million. So is our budget filling that gap or is that gap gonna remain?

                <td> Through you, Madam Mayor, no, we will not be filling that gap and I think one of the things that I think is really important is that we really need to shore up what we have before we do significant expansion and that&#39;s why what we were trying to do was focus specifically on making sure that more of the families with children with special needs were getting served before we were doing a broader expansion and I think I would say that in a budget year in which the message was Figure out how to not grow your budget too much. I would say that the city manager was exceedingly generous knowing what a high priority this is, in that the 91 scholarships, so that was one of the few ARPA funding that was continued because we wanted to make sure that all of those young people served in our community partners were able to continue, and the additional staffing around inclusion as well. What I would also say is, and maybe when we have the committee hearing we could go into more detail on this, When we looked at the overlap between people who were on a wait list in one of the community programs versus actually in a community program, they were on a wait list there, but they were in one of our programs, it did narrow the numbers. The last piece of that 369 were some folks who were identified by the schools over the course of the year and had not applied to any of the programs. And so it&#39;s a tiny bit of mixing apples and oranges, which I&#39;m happy to talk more about when we have the committee meeting, but I would say this year we&#39;re adding one more classroom at the Tobin because we will have the space to be able to, but other than that, we are mostly holding the line right now with the expectation that we need to do the work that&#39;s here before we start adding more students.</td>

Many of our nonprofit partners serve pretty much exclusively low income children. So when we look at their programs, that is not true across the board, but of the five serve a very high percentage of low income. So I would say that the percentage of low income children compares favorably to who&#39;s in our school system and then, but I would say there&#39;s room for us to serve more as we can.</td>

When I was a community member of the Family Policy Council, before I even ran for office, you and I were working on, because none of our after-school programs took kids with special needs at that point, and we reworked everything. So this is, time flies. I wanted to follow up on a question that Councilor Zusy asked. When you come back with some of the numbers, I think we often, It&#39;s important to know the percentage of lower income kids or any of the percent demographics. as compared to who&#39;s in our program, but it&#39;s also important to know what that percentage makes up of the kids who applied, right? So you might say 40% of our programs are low-income kids, but that might be 100% of the low-income kids who applied for the program. So I don&#39;t know what those, I would like that number too, or some of those numbers too, because I don&#39;t know how many of those kids, we know who we&#39;re serving compared to kids in another demographic, but I don&#39;t know the percentage of kids who have applied that we&#39;re serving. Does that make sense?</td>

By and large, we accept every low-income child who applies to our program provided there is a space So we run the lottery the same way we run the lottery for the Cambridge Preschool Program, and we give priority to all of the low-income children first. So if you are a low-income child who applied to our program and you selected enough programs so we can&#39;t if our program is already filled we can&#39;t add you but we put low-income children into each of those slots so for the most part Low income families who are on our wait list are on our wait list because they either applied for programs where there were no seats and they didn&#39;t have a choice that included a program that had seats. Or they applied significantly after the closing date of the program, so of the application process.</td>

And I think that at the time, and I&#39;m not sure who else was here at the time, I think some of the rationale for that was that we didn&#39;t know how much money there&#39;d be, and it seemed like using it on infrastructure would end up using up so much money for one or more projects and that the great desire given the work that had been done was to ensure that we could fund partnerships of nonprofits to actually deliver services differently than the way they were doing it. So that was a choice that was made at the time that the ordinance was adopted to exclude infrastructure as one of the permitted uses of funds. Vice Mayor?</td>

There are three city employees, three members of the nonprofit community who are, and then three residents who can be from anywhere with any set of expertise, and then business representative, a foundation representative, and there&#39;s a third one, oh, university representative. So the committee came together, and first there was a needs assessment that was done, and the needs assessment Instead of doing original research at that point, we had a lot of needs assessments. And so we looked at, we hired a consultant, looked at all the needs assessments that had been done, and then brought together representatives of university, community agencies, did In those days we called them world cafes. I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s still the name. And so we did that. We also got a number of the nonprofits to do focus groups with residents. And we took all that information and then the committee worked over the course of about a year and a half, met with all of the different community agencies. We hosted several. public gatherings to talk about what should be the focus of the funding. Because low income folks were supposed to be the focus of the funding. It didn&#39;t have to be families, but there was very strong support for it being low income families. And what should be the that we were looking for. And the committee ended up, after multiple community processes, recommending that the services be provided to low income families with a preference for single parent households, although any low income families with children under the age of 21 were eligible. And the services that needed to be provided were services directed towards housing instability, financial instability, and mental health related services. And the individual nonprofits needed to apply as collaboratives. So the idea was what could you do with partners different from what you could do on your own. We started with planning grants on the theory that if we wanted the nonprofits to be able to actually come up with a plan, it was important to provide them with funding. We started, I think, with six months, and they all came back and asked, could we have another three months? They had a nine-month planning process. Out of that, some of the partnerships expanded from where they started and came into apply. And you&#39;ll see on page. three of the summary will show you the partnerships that were funded and I would say that we learned a number of things to try to cut to the chase so that you&#39;re not here too long. One of which was because the date that we issued the grant agreements for three years of funding was March 17th or 16th of 2020, that might be meaningful to you from COVID. So we issued these grants just as so many things shut down because of COVID. And so the first year, the partnerships operated very differently. The city agreed to give them upfront funding, which we hadn&#39;t previously done because they needed that. And they were working to provide basic needs for families. So we allowed them to change what they were doing for that year. Gradually, over the course of the next year, they began to provide the services which they had committed to do. The partnerships were all a little bit different, which was the idea here, which is you tell us what it is that you think you can do to make a difference in families&#39; lives. And so, Families Moving Forward, which was headed up by Justice Start, was a program based on the empath model, which some of you may know about. But anyway, it was a small group of families who got intensive case management services over the course of three years. It turned out to be closer to four by the time we and they were able to set goals and get support towards working for their goals, and they also could earn savings money by reaching the goals that they had established. So that was one partnership, and it was quite a large partnership. You can see they had six or seven different partners. The Family Stability Project, which was De Novo, and CEOC and Transition House had a somewhat different model, trying to set up a no-wrong door. You need our services. You come anywhere. We will hook you up with whoever it is that can best meet your needs. So that was what their partnership looked like, and also training for other nonprofits. The Port Arise Institute, which was interesting community arts center, Margaret Fuller House, and Tutoring Plus, all three of those organizations had leadership changes during the course of this partnership. And one of the main things that they talked about they changed a lot of what they had planned but that what it was how critical it was to them to be part of a partnership as each new director came in they were part of something larger than just their organization and then finally the Strengthening Families Together, which was the Community Arts Center, the Baldwin Community Center, and East End House. And that was a partnership which was really focused on supporting parenting and mental health services for families whose children attended those after-school programs. And I would say the kind of critical learnings for the partnerships, first, how critical case management services are, that if you stay with families over the long haul, that the amount of trust you need to build before families begin to talk about what&#39;s actually going on, so you start with families believing that Sharing with you there&#39;s this problem and the longer the staff work with the same family Families share different things and are prepared to work on different things. I think a second piece was that Family&#39;s perception of their well-being was something that changed considerably or even if They were not actually in a physically better situation. Families&#39; self-reports of their mental health status and of their own well-being improved over the course of the program. For some families, their actual outcomes improved as well. But being part of these programs made a difference in the way families perceived their own situation and in their knowledge of other services. And I would say the other piece of this was how much the partnerships learned internally about how they could change the services that they had to meet the needs of families. And just one more comment on what we at the committee learned. I think we came in having done so much work pre-pandemic, not exactly prepared for what it would be like to try to support these partnerships during the pandemic. And I think it took a little while, and it&#39;s actually a wonderful group of people, you can see on the last page, It took us a little while to get our legs under us to figure out how flexible we needed to be in order to allow the partnerships to operate in the best possible manner. And I guess the last thing I would say is, Most families need more than the services that any one entity can provide for them. And one of the real values of this is when you allow the partnerships and you pay for the partnership work, which is something that people partner, but there&#39;s no support for the partnership, then you actually can get better outcomes for the people participating.</td>

I&#39;m wondering, at a future human services meeting, we talk about changes to the ordinance, if possible. You know, I think when you bring up families, when you bring up this money, I think There can be a lot of uses, and I think about cash to families directly, obviously through organizations, whatever kind of things we can think of, but I think there&#39;s great work to follow up on, but I think times have changed as well, and so thinking about at least having that conversation in human services I think would be great.

I guess I haven&#39;t seen the ordinance, but speaking to what former Councilor Carlone said, it sounds like historically community benefits have gone to infrastructure projects at 585 Third Street, $40 million was used to build a theater and fund Global Arts Live and relocate the gas transfer facility at Moderna and MXD. Monies were used to purchase the Grand Junction land, 135 Fulkerson and build a substation. So why did those not go through the community benefit fund if that&#39;s how it was structured?

But let me just say that the council, I believe, passed the Community Benefits Ordinance so that at least some of what was stated at the time was that rather than having individual projects, individual non-profits, all of whom were lobbying for funds when there were either zoning changes or development Instead of that, have there be a process by which the funds could be allocated. But I want to say there&#39;s two pieces that are quite separate. There is a lot of infrastructure work that happens, either city-related infrastructure, which is money that the city gets, for example, like for the Grand Junction or other projects. And so it is not, it is just that the community benefits process for this ordinance is not about infrastructure. So for example, when one of the members of our committee works for Alexandria, and she was able to talk to us about a number of these processes. So typically a developer will work on many different levels, so committing traffic money, committing other sewer and whatever the specifics. But in addition, when you talk about the benefits for the nonprofits, that&#39;s really what the Community Benefits Ordinance was designed to take care of.</td>

Because it sounds like they&#39;ll really be up the creek without that funding. And there aren&#39;t a lot of services in East Cambridge. So anyway, I hope that this discussion won&#39;t eclipse that discussion because I think the community is really, and East Cambridge is really hopeful. There&#39;s broad support for funding East End House, which provides support for 300 families. So we will have that conversation. I see the pros and cons to both, but in this case, I feel like East Cambridge doesn&#39;t have a social service organization. So I really, I hope we can support East and House.

I think, you know, as I&#39;m kind of getting caught up on the briefings and the works around the community benefits and how it was established and just it&#39;s. purpose and the intention of it initially, recognizing that we might be in some different times right now around dollars and what we should be using money for and how could we help and support and prioritize certain programs and organizations so that they&#39;re able to maintain and continue to do their great work. We recognize that this benefit right now, because we&#39;re having this conversation and we have an ordinance meeting tomorrow, and yes, we&#39;ll have a further up conversation on the community benefits as a whole at a later date through our committee. I think it&#39;s like it&#39;s really important that we figure out how to really ground the conversation because it feels like in the past it was really very much when dollars come in let&#39;s be very strategic and supportive of all programs and make sure that we&#39;re you know, trying to divvy it up in the best way possible. And, you know, I think right now we know that East End House, like, and again, I don&#39;t want to talk much about it because I know we&#39;re going to dive much deeper tomorrow, but there is some dire need and some emergency needs there. And I think we&#39;ll talk more about kind of like how do we prioritize our programs and make sure that We&#39;re able to support other organizations at the same time. And so, Assistant City Manager, can you just speak to how we prioritize organizations to make sure that they&#39;re able to continue to provide the quality of work that they&#39;ve been able to do for a century plus, many of these nonprofits?</td>

But when it comes to infrastructure needs, which I know you&#39;re talking about, I think the Redevelopment Authority has played a very large role in helping organizations both do not enormous but reasonable infrastructure improvements and they&#39;ve also helped different organizations take a look at what is possible. I know they&#39;re currently working with the Margaret Fuller House on what could a development look like there that would support the redevelopment of the Margaret Fuller House and the continuation of their services. And I would also say that in the end, The city council also plays a role as you often bring forward information that the city manager and the team look at about how can we be supportive of programs that are meeting a deep need in our community.</td>

                <td> Thank you so much. And also with all due respect to the city process and how we do things around here, it often could be a long time, right? Like it can take some time to actually implement procedures and processes and all that stuff. And we recognize that many of our community partners, our nonprofits, they don&#39;t have a lot of time to wait for decisions to get made from this body in order for the implementation to then roll out. So I think I grapple with the urgency of need with some of our community partners and kind of the rollout of like how long a body takes to make decisions, put things into implementation, and then keep things going. Because, you know, I think about like, for example, the foundry that took like almost a decade, right? Or things around like universal pre-K that, you know. These are great things. I&#39;m happy that we get to these points and it&#39;s not that that&#39;s the community benefits fund, but just really thinking about just the processes as a whole of how can we do things a little bit quicker so that again, we don&#39;t lose maybe a staple in a community that&#39;s providing such great need to many members, not only in the East Cambridge community, but across the city. uh to to continue to do its work so again i look forward to having more of a conversation tomorrow specifically to east end house and then at a later day have uh the community benefits um uh up you know to continue to work through how we&#39;re utilizing these funds and making sure that our non-profits especially those that are really holding down communities and neighborhoods families from babies to elders to make sure that they are equipped to having all their needs met to continue to do this great work. Because as we look at many of these organizations that are a century plus old, they&#39;re in buildings that are that are not okay. I don&#39;t know any other words to use right now. I have several other words I could actually use, but I&#39;m going to use the just not okay buildings for the programming that they&#39;re offering and recognize that some of them have expiration dates. and will crumble if they&#39;re not well-maintained and cared for. So I don&#39;t want to see that happen. I don&#39;t want to see that lost to any neighborhood or community. So as we can continue to work and push and make smart choices and think about how we can service all or many through dollars that are coming in would be ideal. With that, I&#39;ll yield.

So that was good. But outside of that, I&#39;ve seen no publicity about the fact that the easy ride is available for free. to anybody. So I think publicity of the service is really important. And I worry because in Cambridgeport, I never see a single person on that bus. So I wondered if, so it&#39;s a great idea, but it&#39;s a problem if people aren&#39;t using it. And I wondered if you had any information, any numbers about ridership. I know most of the ridership is in the morning and between North Station and Kendall, but do you have any numbers? Because, again, it&#39;s a great idea, but it costs something, and if people aren&#39;t using it, it&#39;s a problem.</td>

I don&#39;t use it every day, but I find that there was some issues... There were some issues with the locations moving and all that stuff, but near MIT, there are a ton of people. So I&#39;m curious about the ridership numbers, but I think it&#39;s great that they&#39;re expanding to the weekend. I think now, I think, sure, there can always be more awareness and there is going to be a ribbon cutting and the council did get invited to that and we should share that and We should all share it in our newsletters. We should help the city also advertise it in our own ways. And yeah, that&#39;s a great idea. Maybe I&#39;ll do a little montage of me on the easy ride. So anyway, I wanted to say I do use it. So thank you.</td>

It&#39;s very, very powerful Because you&#39;re hearing from actors representing black men that Stephanie Gerard interviewed share their lives and their thoughts and their concerns. And you feel like you&#39;re privy to reflections that... It seems it&#39;s a very special, concerning, and disturbing thing. So I recommend that all of you see the film, and I&#39;m glad that there will be a viewing not only at the library, but there&#39;ll be several other opportunities to see it in the next month. So I just wanted to give a plug for the film and the good work that Stephanie&#39;s doing. Thank you. I yield.</td>

But the individuals who have sponsored this work around where do black men live, you know, and just coupling it with mass incarceration. There&#39;s some great work that&#39;s happening through the Black Response, through the Bob Moses Project with Dr. Janet Moses and the work that she&#39;s doing on mass incarceration. I think about Senator Liz Miranda and her work, and then we also have here tonight the Clean Slate. So there&#39;s just a lot of work that folks need to be doing around supporting individuals, but specifically black men, and how, when you do have a record, how that just impacts your ability to do so much more, whether that&#39;s gain employment, gain housing, really to live a quality life in our city and in any community, to be honest. But, you know, when I think back as just being someone who grew up here to many of my black brothers who grew up many of my peers and the various struggles that they experience from police profiling to then catching their first case on anything. It could be just literally anything that then it just became a huge snowball of limitations and restrictions to just advancement in life. And so again, I want to appreciate the work that&#39;s going into this. I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;ll be able to catch the film because I do have a prior engagement on the 29th, but in recognizing that this also with our Juneteenth events that are happening, the other Juneteenth event that&#39;s on its third annual, that again, you&#39;ll learn more about soon. There&#39;s a lot going on in our city, right? And I just want to appreciate the many people who are volunteering their time to make sure that our city has robust programming and opportunities to learn more and raise awareness on a variety of issues and topics. So just thank you.</td>

                <td> Thanks, Mr. Vice Mayor. I just wanted to provide a little bit of context for this and answer some of the questions we heard in public comment. The goal of this policy order is not to eliminate the functions of the Peace Commission. It&#39;s to look at the structure of the commission and see if that structure can be improved and enhanced by bringing it together with another department. I think in some ways the city is already doing this because the interim director is also the director of the Human Rights Commission. I think it makes sense to review city departments and commissions from time to time. We&#39;ve been having this conversation about a number of boards and commissions um we have gotten some questions about this one in particular from the public uh with the not having a permanent director since october um so i think it makes sense especially at this time of transition to do this review um to be clear it&#39;s not asking the city manager to zero out the budget for the peace commission if we had wanted to do that we could have you know had that conversation in the uh the finance hearings this is about asking the city manager to explore possibilities to improve the the functions that the peace commission carries out and we&#39;ll see what the report back from the city manager says. With that, I yield back. Thank you. Councillor Noonan.</td>

                <td>Thank you. Yes, I am glad that Councillor Sabrini really clarified. This is an optimal time. As we also know, there may be other commissions eventually. There&#39;s a whole range of things we&#39;ve talked often in this chamber that it really would be prudent to... to think about all the boards, commissions, task forces we have and to think about ways that we might streamline them and make them efficient while understanding how they fit within the city and to maybe have a sunset and review of various ones. So we can&#39;t do that all at once. We&#39;ve really heard from the city manager that&#39;s a very large task that will take a long time. one that happens to be in a position to be looked at right now. I did want to, if it made sense for the body, since this is both the Peace Commission and also serves as a police review and advisory board, to make it clear in the order that they should probably also be looked at the same time of the functions of the Peace Commission and PRAB. If something changes, it might be that both of them would change. So I sent that suggested amendment to the clerk. It was just to add in the order after Peace Commission and PRAB.</td>

                <td>I would say hold off and let me explain why my colleagues will indulge me for a couple of things. I want to begin acknowledging the intent of the policy order before us regarding the Peace Commission. I really appreciate the ongoing commitment to ensuring the effectiveness and the alignment of the city&#39;s commissions, particularly those with critical public safety and community relations responsibilities. That said, I believe this particular order wants further consideration and refinement moving forward with the Executive Director of the Peace Commission currently on leave, The issues before us are as much about personnel matters as they are about departmental operations. And personnel matters do not fall under the purview of the city council. They fall under the purview of the city manager. And I want to ensure that we&#39;re asking the proper questions and involving the appropriate city staff on this. I&#39;m concerned that initiating structural changes or discussions about consolidating functions with the executive director while he remains on leave is unwise. We did hear from Pastor Kim that spoke to this and therefore I&#39;m going to be exercising my charter right in order to provide us with some time to tweak the language in order to make it comply with what our authority is and what the city manager&#39;s authority is, and to ensure that we&#39;re framing the question in the correct way. So I&#39;ll yield the floor, but I&#39;m exercising my charter right. We&#39;ll move on to then number three, and it was, I can&#39;t read your writing. What&#39;s? SS? SS? Oh, thank you. Sorry. It could have been anybody. This is pulled by Council Siddiqui and reads as follows. That the City Council go on record in support of HD 1811 backslash SD 1114 and HD 1693 backslash SD 1124 and the Clean State Slate Massachusetts Campaign. This was pulled by Councilor Siddiqui.

As we heard, clean state laws are a vital part a broader criminal justice reform. The bills we&#39;re discussing would automate the sealing of criminal records for people who&#39;ve completed their sentences, and they would also expand eligibility so more people have a real chance at a fresh start. And we know that even older minor records, even for cases that ended in dismissal, can create lasting barriers to employment, housing, education, and more. and sealing these records really does change lives it helps boost job prospects increases earnings and helps reduce poverty and this directly benefits individuals families and entire communities and it&#39;s really a matter of racial and economic justice so other movie other cities are moving forward springfield just recently passed a similar resolution in support of this initiative and also several members of our state delegation have already signed on to support this legislation. So I hope the remainder of my colleagues will join me and the other co-sponsors in supporting this policy order so that Cambridge can officially add its voice to this important statewide push for fairness, opportunity, and reform.

                <td> I&#39;ve really come around with this. I think we should. I think your amendments are great, and I think the city should invest in this study. I spoke with John DiGiovanni earlier today, and he shared that the MBTA has been engaged at the site, so they know about this project. It&#39;s not a surprise to them. And also the city must file the RFP if the city might want to pursue or engage in a public-private partnership at the site later. So that&#39;s the reason that the city should be doing this rather than the Harvard Square Business Association. And then also the Harvard Square Business Association has already invested 50 to $60,000 in this project. I mean, that&#39;s what it costs to do the models, the renderings that showed us all how groovy it could be down in the tunnel at Harvard Square. And then he convinced me also that the timing is actually perfect because it will take over a year to, this has to be bid out, the RFP needs to be written, responses need to come in. So then the city can act on this in a couple of years. And it&#39;s time, Harvard Square needs a boost. And this could be just the boost that it needs. And the other thing John Giovanni said was that an outside partner would be funding this. This wouldn&#39;t be a big city project. It would be funded by a private developer. So that made me feel better about it, too. I think it&#39;s an exciting opportunity, and I think it was a brilliant idea, Councilor Azeem and Councilor Toner, to link it to the $300,000 for the pedestrian study, which it sounds like Harvard Square has already done. So they may not need all that money since a lot of that work has already happened, and the money&#39;s been allocated. So great work, and thank you. I support this. I yield.</td>

The criteria for me are really clear that if more than half of the folks who live within a block of the property oppose it, then I could not support it since that&#39;s our role.</td>

Also on June 8th, the Cambridge Museum of History and Culture will be doing How Sweet It Is, which is the history of candy in Cambridge, and that will be at the Kendall Public Lobby on June 8th from 1 to 3, I believe. in the afternoon but I&#39;ll make sure everyone gets something in their mail box. Any other discussions other than entertaining a motion to adjourn? Council Wilson. On a motion by Council Wilson to adjourn any discussion? Hearing none, all those in favor say aye. Opposed? The ayes have it, the meeting is so adjourned.</td>
