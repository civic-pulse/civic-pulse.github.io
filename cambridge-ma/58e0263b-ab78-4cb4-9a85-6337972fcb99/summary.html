<h3 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h3>
<p>The Cambridge Planning Board, in a joint meeting with the Cambridge Redevelopment Authority (CRA) Board, addressed two primary items related to Boston Properties' Kendall Square urban redevelopment area. The Board approved a special permit amendment (PB 294 and PB 315) allowing the sharing of 150 long-term bicycle parking spaces between 88 Ames Street and 325 Main Street, determining it to be a minor amendment. Following this, the Board received a design update on the Center Plaza and East-West Connector, part of the Infill Development Concept Plan (PB 315), providing feedback on proposed play area options and overall landscape design. The Board also granted an extension of time for a major amendment application related to PB 315 until December 31, 2025.</p>

</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Proponent Presentation (Jeff Lohnberg, BXP):</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Project Team:</strong> Jeff Lohnberg, Catalina Pidea (BXP).</li>
<li><strong>Context:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>PB 294:</strong> 88 Ames Street (Proto Apartments, 280 units), approved 2015, occupied 2018.</li>
<li><strong>PB 315:</strong> Infill Development Concept Plan (IDCP), original approval for 145 Broadway, subsequent amendment for 325 Main Street (approved 2019, occupied 2022), and a second amendment for Eversource Substation, 250/290 Binney, and 121 Broadway.</li>
<li>Request for PB 315 only involves 325 Main Street.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Existing Bike Parking at 88 Ames Street:</strong><ul>
<li>Total 295 long-term spaces.</li>
<li>150 spaces in a three-level bike shed (54 ground, 48 second, 48 third).</li>
<li>113 spaces on the fifth level of the garage (connected to residential building).</li>
<li>32 spaces within the green garage.</li>
<li>42 short-term spaces (primarily on Ames Street).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Utilization Data (88 Ames Street):</strong><ul>
<li>Building occupancy: 90%+ since 2019.</li>
<li>Bike parking utilization: Max 48 bikes (18%) out of 295 available spaces.</li>
<li>Reasons for low utilization: Blue Bike memberships, proximity to MBTA, some residents storing bikes in units.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Proposal:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>88 Ames Street (PB 294):</strong><ul>
<li>Level 5 garage spaces (113) remain 100% for 88 Ames residents.</li>
<li>150 bike shed spaces to be shared between Proto and 325 Main.</li>
<li>Ground floor of bike shed to also serve as short-term parking for 325 Main (open to Proto residents, 325 Main employees, and public).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>325 Main Street (PB 315):</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Long-term:</strong> 108 spaces required by zoning. Requesting that shared spaces in the bike shed (levels 2 and 3) count as long-term parking for 325 Main.</li>
<li><strong>Short-term:</strong> 47 spaces to be located within the ground floor of the bike shed (within 50 feet of 325 Main entrance), replacing previously proposed on-street locations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Goal:</strong> Better utilize existing bike parking facilities and balance demand/supply.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Public Comment:</strong> No public comments were received. Adam Schulman (Department of Transportation) was present for questions.</li>
<li><strong>Board Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Dan Anderson:</strong> Inquired about access to the bike shed from Ames Street, noting it's a curb cut and shared with vehicular traffic. Proponent confirmed primary access is off Ames Street, with a loading dock and an exit-only garage exit. Proximity to 325 Main is helpful.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Planning Board Action on PB 294:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Appointment of Associate Members:</strong> Dan Anderson and Joy Jackson were appointed to act on this matter.</li>
<li><strong>Findings:</strong> The Board determined that the proposal is consistent with the purposes of Section 6.100 of the Zoning Ordinance and that the bicycle parking plan satisfactorily serves the needs of all expected users. The amendment also meets the general special permit criteria in Section 10.43.</li>
<li><strong>Motion:</strong> To grant the special permit for PB 294, subject to the conditions set forth in the CDD memo (general conditions of continuing review and review of further changes).<ul>

<h3 id="v-design-update-case-pb-315-infill-development-concept-plan-mxd-zoning-district">V. Design Update: Case PB 315 - Infill Development Concept Plan (MXD Zoning District)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>CDD Staff Summary (Jeff Roberts):</strong><ul>
<li>This is a design update for PB 315 (MXD district Infill Development Concept Plan).</li>
<li>The Planning Board previously requested to see evolving designs for the Center Plaza and East-West Connector.</li>
<li>The Board's role is to provide comments and feedback, not to approve or deny.</li>
<li>Urban Design staff (Eric Thorkelson) and CRA's Design Review Committee (including Planning Board representatives Mary Lydecker and Ashley Tan) have been engaged.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Proponent Presentation (Jeff Lohnberg, BXP):</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Project Team:</strong> Jeff Lohnberg, Catalina Pidea (BXP); Mo Gomez, Steve Engler, Kelly Perrell (Sasaki - Landscape Architects); Grasoldi (MBBJ - Architect for structure cladding); Nicole Chin (Stantec - Overall Coordination).</li>
<li><strong>Timeline:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>December 2024:</strong> Conceptual design for Center Plaza (public open space above substation) approved by Joint CRA/Planning Board.</li>
<li><strong>April 2, 2025:</strong> 50% Design Development (DD) review with Design Review Committee.</li>
<li><strong>June 4, 2025:</strong> 100% DD review with Design Review Committee.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Center Plaza Updates (Mo Gomez, Sasaki):</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Previous Comments Addressed:</strong> Nooks/seating areas, swing elements (added to west side trellis), more robust planting, pathway alignment tweaks.</li>
<li><strong>Overall Layout:</strong> Still similar, but with refinements to planters, lawn area, and play area.</li>
<li><strong>Key Changes:</strong> Increased planting robustness and variety, more variegated seating conditions, flexible movable furnishings, unique paving textures, canted walkway for more planting/play area.</li>
<li><strong>Play Area Options (seeking feedback):</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Option 1: Bird's Nest:</strong><ul>
<li>Theme: Birds, with bird-shaped elements, leaf climbing structures, taller structure for older children.</li>
<li>Features: Two bird elements at entrance, undulating ground plane, sensory play boards, educational panels about birds.</li>
<li>Age ranges: 2-5 years (bird features, leaf climber, stepping logs), 5-12 years (taller timber tower).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Option 2: Beehive:</strong><ul>
<li>Theme: Bees, with bee-shaped climbing elements and honeycomb (hex) forms.</li>
<li>Features: Bee climbing structure at entrance, hex forms in ground plane and as climbing features (smaller for toddlers, larger for 5-12 year olds with nets and slide).</li>
<li>Age ranges: 2-5 years (bee climbing structure, bee springer, beehive climber), 5-12 years (large net climbing structure).</li>
<li>Color scheme: Yellows and blacks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>East-West Connector Updates (Steve Engler, Sasaki):</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Context:</strong> Part of 121 Broadway design review and approval (2022 IDC Amendment). Children's play area originally planned here was moved to Center Plaza.</li>
<li><strong>Delivery:</strong> Tied to 121 Broadway occupancy (Q2 2027 initial, Q3 2027 final).</li>
<li><strong>Previous Design:</strong> Included a children's playground between 105 Broadway and 115 Broadway.</li>
<li><strong>Current Design (without play area):</strong><ul>
<li>Continues crosswalk connection from Center Plaza.</li>
<li>Follows existing path width (approx. 6 ft) to the north of existing trees.</li>
<li>New seating area on the south side of trees (former construction trailer site).</li>
<li>Uses different color pavers (precast concrete) to differentiate quiet seating from circulation, matching Center Plaza.</li>
<li>Bench seating areas.</li>
<li>New trees (replacing non-surviving ones) and existing mature trees (5) retained.</li>
<li>Pervious paving (orange) on south side for tree root aeration.</li>
<li>Maintains service access to 115 Broadway.</li>
<li><strong>Planting:</strong> Woody shrubs in planters, native ground cover, new trees (7) on north side.</li>
<li><strong>Lighting:</strong> Remove existing bollard lighting, replace with new pedestrian poles and taller poles with spot lighting (matching 145 Broadway connector).</li>
<li><strong>Renderings:</strong> Show seating, planting, and connection to Volpe project.</li>
<li><strong>Material Palette:</strong> Matches Fennel Plaza (yellow books), metal planters, trash receptacles.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>CDD Staff Comments (Eric Thorkelson):</strong><ul>
<li>Design continues to improve.</li>
<li>Play area is more interesting; no preference between options.</li>
<li>More vegetation, taller trees (feasible over substation).</li>
<li>Improved geometry of lawn, paths, and slight bend in main diagonal path.</li>
<li>Addressed handicapped access, less pavement.</li>
<li><strong>Suggestions:</strong> More vegetation/varied topography in play area, more complex interior side of perimeter, more play equipment (height, movement), combining structures (like Lincoln Park in Somerville), adult recreation/exercise equipment, more vegetation (containers, vines on trellises), more benches (diagonal path), make area between 290 and exhaust tower more inviting, more trees on west side of west drive, chamfer southeast corner of beacon.</li>
<li><strong>Connector Comments:</strong> Consider how it connects to Volpe and 6th Street walkway, smooth connection, additional trees (northwest corner, south side where no underground storage), consistency of furniture/benches/trash with other areas (VASA, Volpe).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>CRA Staff Comments (Cecilia Cobb, Alex Levering):</strong><ul>
<li>Appreciated BXP and design team's responsiveness to feedback.</li>
<li>Center Plaza design is more cohesive, attractive, welcoming, and provides a different open space experience.</li>
<li>Appreciated changes to nooks, primary walking paths, increased plantings, accessible walkways, and seating areas.</li>
<li>Play area still needs resolution, but options are closer to iconic character.</li>
<li>Appreciated increased play equipment variety, educational play panels, and potential to link themes to substation (birds/bees vs. underground infrastructure).</li>
<li><strong>Alex Levering:</strong> Suggested reviewing furnishing plans to ensure 290 retail can be a thriving space and activate the plaza.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Planning Board Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Mary Lydecker:</strong><ul>
<li>Appreciates the two play area options.</li>
<li>Prefers the "Bird's Nest" option for better scale against large infrastructure elements (intake/exhaust).</li>
<li>Concerned about themes being too literal or random; suggests pulling inspiration from the substation itself (e.g., educational panels about what's underground).</li>
<li>References Peabody School Playground for examples of taller, more tech-oriented structures.</li>
<li>Agrees with Eric's idea of undulating edges for play area to create nooks.</li>
<li>Suggests musical elements for non-fall zones.</li>
<li>Praises canted walk and increased green space.</li>
<li>Curious about the "deck" feel.</li>
<li><strong>East-West Connector:</strong> Questions need for so much pathway/seating, prefers more softscape. Hopes for coherence in site furnishings with Center Plaza.</li>
<li><strong>Planting:</strong> Notes heavy perennial, light woody shrubs, potential for winter barrenness. Questions native claims for some species. Suggests Sasaki ecologist review connector palette.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Ashley Tan:</strong><ul>
<li>Appreciates efforts to make the space interesting despite the substation.</li>
<li>Likes educational signage and murals.</li>
<li>Emphasizes scale of play area to not be lost.</li>
<li><strong>East-West Connector:</strong> Asks about anticipated bike traffic and safety for pedestrians, given connection to a bike path.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Dan Anderson:</strong><ul>
<li>Path and nooks are a great improvement.</li>
<li>Appreciates planting around the beacon, but still questions detail of corner engagement.</li>
<li>Lighting is critical; questions for plaza.</li>
<li>Agrees with Mary on scale for play area; suggests a large sculptural tree with height, volume, and motion.</li>
<li>Agrees with Eric on undulating edges for play area.</li>
<li>Notes previous East-West connector play area had vibrant blues/whites; current options feel muted. Suggests more vibrant color.</li>
<li><strong>East-West Connector:</strong> Suggests integrated lower-level lighting under benches, pushing benches back for comfort. Mentions a previous 50% set with two paths that might allow more planting.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Joy Jackson:</strong><ul>
<li>Agrees with integrating substation context.</li>
<li>Agrees with Dan on integrating color into play area.</li>
<li>Notes East-West connector original rendering had blues; suggests exploring alternatives.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Ted Cohen:</strong><ul>
<li>Appreciates work by proponent, CRA, and design team.</li>
<li>Echoes colleagues' comments.</li>
<li>Still feels there's too much hardscape in the plaza; suggests more grass.</li>
<li>Prefers "Bird's Nest" scheme for play area, as climbing structure echoes intake/exhaust, leading to questions about underground.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Conrad Crawford (CRA Chair):</strong><ul>
<li>Agrees with Planning Board comments.</li>
<li>Emphasizes interpretation of substation use (e.g., Museum of Science discovery room for electrical circuitry).</li>
<li>Mentions historical Broad Canal and telling the story of the landscape in the East-West Connector.</li>
<li>Endorses an exploratory strategy for the landscape.</li>
<li>Recalls suggestion of "habitat" theme.</li>
<li>Suggests differentiating paths in East-West Connector (e.g., stone dust for slowing down, paved for moving).</li>
<li>Feedback from 9-year-old: liked both bird's nest and beehive, found beehive climbing structure compelling and bird's nest theme compelling.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Proponent Response (Jeff Lohnberg):</strong> Confirmed that water features are not allowed on top of the substation due to Eversource constraints, but there is a water feature planned for 121 Broadway's public plaza.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Planning Board Action:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Appointment of Associate Members:</strong> Joy Jackson and Dan Anderson were appointed to vote on this matter.</li>
<li><strong>Motion:</strong> To conclude the design update.<ul>
