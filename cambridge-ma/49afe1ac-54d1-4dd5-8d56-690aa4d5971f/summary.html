<p><strong>Executive Summary:</strong>
The Cambridge City Council convened a public meeting to discuss the property tax rate classification for Fiscal Year 2026. Key discussions revolved around a proposed 22% increase in the commercial tax rate, its impact on local businesses, and the city's overall fiscal health. Public comments largely expressed concern over the significant tax increase and its potential negative effects on small businesses and non-profits. The City Manager and staff provided context on the budget process, the split tax rate, and the economic factors influencing the tax levy. The Council also addressed updates on ICE interactions within the city, appointments to the Cambridge Housing Authority Board, a grant for a resilience hub at the Cambridge Community Center, and the Zero Emissions Transportation Plan. A charter right was exercised to delay the vote on the tax rate classification for two weeks to allow for further community engagement.</p>

<li>
<p><strong>Speakers:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Denise Gilson (Executive Director, Harvard Square Business Association):</strong><ul>
<li>Expressed concern over the proposed 22% increase in the commercial tax rate for 2026, stating it was learned only today.</li>
<li>Highlighted that the increase would impact small family firms, local universities, and small businesses (retailers, restaurateurs, service providers) through higher rents and consumer prices.</li>
<li>Urged the Council to reject or postpone the proposal for proper analysis, transparency, and stakeholder input.</li>
<li><strong>Key Quote:</strong> "A 22% increase in commercial property taxes will not stop at the property owner's door. It will be passed down to tenants in the form of higher rents and ultimately to consumers through higher prices."</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Dan Marshall (President and Executive Artistic Director, Cambridge Community Center for the Arts):</strong><ul>
<li>Stated that a 22% increase is significant, especially for non-profits and small businesses paying triple net rent.</li>
<li>Emphasized that real estate taxes in Cambridge are already high and this increase could jeopardize business survival.</li>
<li>Called for a more open process with community feedback and discussion.</li>
<li>Noted that businesses have not recovered from the pandemic and empty storefronts are prevalent.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Ivy Moylan (Executive Director, Brattle Theater and Brattle Film Foundation):</strong><ul>
<li>Urged the City Council to delay the tax decision, citing the 22% increase as "out of bounds."</li>
<li>Explained that as a non-profit, the Brattle Theater pays 20% of its budget in real estate taxes, which would increase significantly.</li>
<li>Stated that landlords pass taxes to tenants, disproportionately hurting small businesses and non-profits.</li>
<li>Requested transparency and justification for the "out of bounds tax increase."</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Raj Danda (Property Owner, Harvard Square):</strong><ul>
<li>Expressed concern that the 22% increase would make the cost of doing business too high, leading tenants to leave.</li>
<li>Noted a significant decline in demand and quality of inquiries for commercial spaces in Harvard Square over the last year.</li>
<li>Stated that Harvard Square needs help to regain its vibrancy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Nicola Williams (A. Brewer Street; Facilitator, Cambridge Summit for Black Business Network; Board Member, Harvard Square Business Association):</strong><ul>
<li>Highlighted that small businesses are bearing the brunt of the economic downturn and pandemic recovery.</li>
<li>Called for more transparency and notice regarding such significant tax proposals.</li>
<li>Acknowledged the city's need for funds but urged shared sacrifice across the board, not just from small businesses.</li>
<li>Suggested tabling the proposal for a thorough conversation with the business community.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Suzanne Blier (Phi Fuller Place; President, Harvard Squared Neighborhood Association):</strong><ul>
<li>Attributed the situation to national impacts like empty offices.</li>
<li>Argued against targeting small businesses, which have been hard hit by tariffs.</li>
<li>Suggested the city reduce its expenses by 22% to match the proposed tax increase, emphasizing equity.</li>
<li>Noted that homeowners' taxes are also rising dramatically, impacting those on fixed incomes.</li>

</li>

<li>Commended the memo for its information and suggested a public hearing to explain tax apportionment.</li>
<li>Noted the city is "eating up more of our excess levy limit."</li>
<li>Questioned the actual impact of the commercial tax rate increase, given declining commercial values.</li>
<li>Requested clarification on the impact of upzoning on residential taxes and the contribution of new growth.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Robert Winters (366 Broadway):</strong><ul>
<li>Expressed surprise at claims of late notice, noting the City Manager's letter was available days prior.</li>
<li>Clarified that a 22% tax rate increase does not equate to a 22% tax bill increase due to an 11.5% decrease in commercial values.</li>
<li>Asked for clarification on how the decrease in commercial valuations is distributed across different commercial sectors (e.g., Kendall Square vs. neighborhood retail).</li>
<li>Highlighted significant residential tax bill increases (condominiums 13.3%, single-family 10.2%, two-family 9.2%, three-family 8.9%), which are triple the inflation rate.</li>

<h4 id="b-city-managers-communication-on-tax-rate-for-fiscal-year-2026">B. City Manager's Communication on Tax Rate for Fiscal Year 2026</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Agenda Item:</strong> Communication transmitted from Yi-An Huang, City Manager, relative to votes necessary to seek approval from the Massachusetts Department of Revenue of the tax rate for Fiscal Year 2026.</li>
<li><strong>City Manager's Remarks (Yi-An Huang):</strong><ul>
<li>The budget process began in November of the previous year, acknowledging an economic downturn after years of growth.</li>
<li>Budget growth for FY26 was set at 3.8%, significantly lower than prior years (7-9%).</li>
<li>Despite lower operating budget growth, the tax levy growth is higher (8%) due to declining other revenue sources, particularly building permit revenues.</li>
<li>The commercial tax rate is increasing significantly, but overall dollar amounts paid will be moderated by declining valuations, especially in large office and lab spaces.</li>
<li>Hotels, with stable values, will see a higher dollar increase.</li>
<li>The Council's vote is on the split rate, specifically the percentage shift between commercial and residential.</li>
<li>The proposal is to shift the commercial tax rate from 140% of the residential rate (last year) to 152% (this year) to protect residential taxpayers.</li>
<li>The decisions driving the tax rate were part of the budget process in June, and the current discussion is about how the rates play out across classes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Councillor Azeem:</strong><ul>
<li>Confirmed the FY26 budget is set, and the only decision is the balance between commercial and residential rates.</li>
<li>Clarified that the 22% rate increase does not mean a 22% tax bill increase for all commercial properties due to declining valuations; the average increase is closer to 8%.</li>
<li>Noted that Cambridge still has the lowest commercial tax rates compared to neighboring communities.</li>
<li>Inquired about the impact of reduced development on the tax rate, noting new growth was 40% less than the previous year.</li>
<li>Asked about the future outlook for tax rates and the status of the excess levy capacity.</li>
<li><strong>Gail Willett (Assessor):</strong> Confirmed that commercial values decreased by about 12.5% across the class, but the impact varies by property type (e.g., labs decreased significantly, hotels stable or slightly up). Retail/restaurant will feel more of the brunt (11% increase), while lab/office less (1-7% increase).</li>
<li><strong>Yi-An Huang:</strong> Stated that economic trends are expected to continue, with the city approaching the 175% maximum for commercial tax rates, beyond which the burden shifts entirely to residential. Emphasized moderating budget growth as the best way to manage tax burden during economic downturns.</li>
<li><strong>Kathy Watkins (Deputy City Manager):</strong> Explained that excess levy capacity for FY26 is estimated at $172 million, an 8.6% decrease from last year, indicating the city is drawing on reserves to balance the budget without reductions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Councillor Nolan:</strong><ul>
<li>Praised the provided examples of commercial tax rates by category, clarifying that actual payments will vary from the 22% rate increase.</li>
<li>Confirmed that state law prevents different tax rates for small businesses vs. large corporations or by commercial use type (retail vs. office vs. lab).</li>
<li>Expressed concern about the timing of the information release and the vote, suggesting earlier public notification for future years.</li>
<li>Highlighted significant residential tax bill increases (up to 11% for single-family, two-family, three-family homes).</li>
<li>Asked if mid-year budget corrections are possible if tax increases are calamitous (Ms. Spinner stated it would be extremely difficult).</li>
<li>Noted the impact of economic headwinds (declining commercial values, MIT endowment hit) on future fiscal planning.</li>
<li><strong>Gail Willett:</strong> Confirmed that new residential development helps stabilize taxes by providing new growth.</li>
<li><strong>Yi-An Huang:</strong> Reiterated that the current low commercial tax rate is a result of past growth in office/lab, and the downturn reverses this, impacting stable-value sectors like hotels more.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Councillor Zusy:</strong><ul>
<li>Expressed concern about the 22% increase given rising utility costs.</li>
<li>Asked if the 22% commercial tax levy increase was predictable in June during budget discussions (Ms. Spinner stated commercial pays the same percentage of the levy, but the rate calculation depends on final valuations in late summer).</li>
<li>Sought clarification on property classifications (commercial, industrial, residential) and the definition of "industrial" (primarily lab/R&amp;D space).</li>
<li>Noted the significant decrease in new growth from FY25 ($24 million) to FY26 ($13.7 million), demonstrating a slowdown in development.</li>
<li>Inquired about the distribution of new growth and value declines across the city (Ms. Willett noted continued new growth in Kendall Square and Alewife, but slower build-out due to tenant demand).</li>
<li>Urged evaluating and consolidating programs, and working more efficiently due to less resources, cautioning against overwhelming businesses with fees.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Action:</strong> Councillor Toner exercised a Charter Right to delay the vote on the tax rate classification for two weeks.</li>

<h4 id="e-city-manager-agenda-item-number-seven-incentive-zoning-nexus-study">E. City Manager Agenda Item Number Seven: Incentive Zoning Nexus Study</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Agenda Item:</strong> Communication transmitted from Yi-An Huang, City Manager, relative to awaiting report item 25-20 regarding incentive zoning nexus study.</li>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Councillor Toner:</strong> Questioned the nexus between high-end office/lab development and the need for affordable housing, given that many workers in these sectors may not qualify for affordable housing.</li>
<li><strong>Stuart Cotter (CDD):</strong> Explained that the study uses a methodology to project job types (including lower-middle skill jobs) in new development and determine the number of affordable housing units needed for those workers. Funds from incentive provisions (linkage fees) contribute to the Affordable Housing Trust, which can be used for various affordable housing initiatives.</li>
<li><strong>Councillor Toner:</strong> Clarified that the study uses existing employees to understand housing needs, not just those in new buildings. Inquired if the current economic situation and vacancy rates would factor into the study's recommendations for linkage fees.</li>
<li><strong>Stuart Cotter:</strong> Confirmed the study would consider current market conditions and regional competitiveness of exactions.</li>
<li><strong>Councillor Azeem:</strong> Advocated for a continuous function or marginal rate for linkage fees to avoid "dead zones" in development. Expressed that linkage fees are generally low and do not inhibit commercial development.</li>
<li><strong>Councillor Nolan:</strong> Questioned how a marginal rate structure aligns with a nexus study's purpose of assessing the impact of development on affordable housing needs.</li>
<li><strong>Stuart Cotter:</strong> Explained that the study establishes an upper limit, and policy trade-offs (like exemptions for smaller projects or variations by location/use) can be discussed within that limit, in coordination with the City Solicitor.</li>
<li><strong>Vice Mayor McGovern:</strong> Raised concerns about the cumulative impact of various fees on development, especially during economic downturns, and the potential for developers to choose other communities with lower fees. Highlighted that many jobs in lab/office buildings are not high-paying (e.g., lab technicians, security guards) and these workers need affordable housing.</li>
<li><strong>Councillor Zusy:</strong> Supported the study but expressed concern about Cambridge's high linkage fee ($36.36/sq ft) compared to neighboring cities (Somerville $22.46, Boston $30.78/$23.09, Watertown $11.50), fearing it could deter development. Advocated for a balanced approach that considers housing, sustainability (solar protection), and tree preservation.</li>

<li><strong>City Staff:</strong> Confirmed willingness to incorporate Councillor Nolan's suggestions into the plan.</li>
<li><strong>Councillor Zusy:</strong> Praised the plan's comprehensiveness and community engagement efforts. Suggested engaging residents impacted by congestion (e.g., Putnam Avenue, North Mass Ave).

Noted the high number of permitted vehicles (over 44,000) and the potential future impact of shared autonomous vehicles.</li>
<li><strong>Councillor Wilson:</strong> Appreciated the in-depth plan and its focus on mobility for all. Inquired about the financial implications and projected costs of implementing the plan over the next several years/decades, emphasizing the need for transparency and numbers.</li>
<li><strong>City Staff:</strong> Stated that page 49 of the report outlines short-term actions (1-2 years) that are already within the planning framework, and more detailed long-term cost projections could be provided for the adoption phase.</li>
<li><strong>Councillor Wilson:</strong> Reiterated the importance of financial transparency and the need to balance ambitious plans with other city needs. Asked about community engagement specifics for this plan.</li>
<li><strong>City Staff:</strong> Detailed extensive community engagement efforts, including 50 focus groups, community meetings, individual interviews, an advisory group, and collaboration with the Office of Language Justice for translations and interpretation.</li>

<h4 id="b-charter-right-number-two-zoning-language-for-solar-protection">B. Charter Right Number Two: Zoning Language for Solar Protection</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Policy Order:</strong> That the City Manager is requested to work with the Community Development Department to draft zoning language based on the proposed recommendations, review the feasibility of the proposed recommendations with developers, and consider the possibility of having AHO construction be exempt from the proposed zoning.</li>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Councillor Zusy:</strong> Withdrew her amendment by substitution. Advocated for proceeding with CDD's recommendations to protect solar installations, citing the city's encouragement of solar and its contribution to net-zero goals. Supported considering AHO construction exemption.</li>
<li><strong>Councillor Nolan:</strong> Provided context on the policy order, stemming from Health and Environment Committee discussions and CDD's extensive analysis. Emphasized the intent to apply changes only to parcels wholly in C1 and to incorporate council goals. Highlighted the analysis suggesting a 3-6% loss in gross floor area for housing production to protect solar access.</li>
<li><strong>Councillor Toner:</strong> Questioned if solar protection could be achieved without reducing housing units (Assistant Manager Peters confirmed an inherent trade-off of 3-6% GFA loss). Expressed concern about the reported loss being higher and the uncertainty created for developers. Suggested making a decision tonight rather than prolonging the process.</li>
<li><strong>Councillor Azeem:</strong> Suggested sending the matter to committee to discuss with other zoning considerations and options (e.g., buyback programs, compensation).</li>
<li><strong>Councillor Nolan:</strong> Expressed concern that sending it to committee (especially only Housing Committee) would slow it down. Asked if staff could still meet with developers and explore feasibility if sent to committee (Assistant Manager Peters confirmed they would). Suggested sending it to both Health and Environment and Housing Committees.</li>
<li><strong>Vice Mayor McGovern:</strong> Agreed with sending to committee, noting the need for more conversation with developers to understand financial impacts and avoid unintended consequences (e.g., effectively lowering inclusionary housing percentages).</li>
<li><strong>Councillor Zusy:</strong> Emphasized the need for a balanced view, protecting solar and trees while also building housing, and ensuring Cambridge remains special.</li>
