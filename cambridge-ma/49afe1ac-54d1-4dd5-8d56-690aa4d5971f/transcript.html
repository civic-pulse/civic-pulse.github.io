                <td> Good evening. My name is Denise Gilson. I&#39;m the executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association. I appreciate the opportunity to speak this evening. It was only today that we learned of the special hearing and of the proposal to raise the commercial tax rate by 22% for 2026. This abrupt and significant increase will have far reaching consequences for our community. While it may be tempting to view this measure as a way to address this. as a way to address fiscal shortfalls by targeting large, possibly faceless, corporate property owners. The reality is that in Cambridge, property ownership varies. And this will have deep, profound consequences. Our commercial property owners include small family firms, local universities already struggling, and countless small businesses, retailers, restaurateurs, and service providers who either rent or own their spaces. They are our employees, our neighbors, and the heart of our commercial business districts. A 22% increase in commercial property taxes will not stop at the property owner&#39;s door. It will be passed down to tenants in the form of higher rents and ultimately to consumers through higher prices. At a time when so many are already struggling to cope with rising costs, this measure risks doing real harm to our small business community into the economic vitality of our city. We urge the council to reject or postpone this proposal until there can be proper analysis, transparency and stakeholder input. Let&#39;s work together on solutions that are. sustainable, fair, and that keep Cambridge small businesses strong and keep our residents and visitors shopping and dining in our community. Thank you.</td>

                <td> Thank you very much. I&#39;m Dan Marshall, the President and Executive Artistic Director of the Cambridge Community Center for the Arts. We are a service organization. Most recently, last few years, we renovated the Multicultural Arts Center and I&#39;ve been operating out of there. However, we are in a process of identifying and negotiating a couple of new art center locations for the benefit of Cambridge. And one of them, we would have to pay commercial real estate taxes if we either purchase it or rent it. As the previous speaker said, there&#39;s a lot of small businesses as well as tenants who would be affected. If we&#39;re paying triple net rent, then it passes along to us. The real estate taxes in Cambridge are already really high. as they are in other small towns. And raising them 22% is a significant proposal. I also, you know, I&#39;m surprised that the notice was just today. Very lucky to see the email and wanted to say something. And as you may know, getting a tax abatement if a nonprofit owns a building is not a given. It takes time and a couple thousand dollars more a month of real estate taxes on a rent of let&#39;s say $10,000 a month is a significant chunk and sometimes can make or break the ability of a business to survive. I do want to repeat what the previous speaker said, that this should be a process beyond what has already been done, that&#39;s open, that you get a lot more feedback and discussion. from the community. I want to add to that, that also we have not recovered from the pandemic, not even close to recovered from the pandemic. A lot of businesses are still, especially in the arts, but also in bars and restaurants are still not seeing the same level of customers as before the pandemic, but the taxes have kept going up. And this is not the time to raise taxes when you have a bunch of empty storefronts as well. And instead, let&#39;s work together to revitalize the city and create real income. And once there&#39;s real income, there&#39;s more contribution, more commerce, and there&#39;s other ways to enrich the city. And eventually, when we all recover, then just having a nominal tax increase It&#39;s totally fair as the city has increased expenses, but 22% is not great at this moment, and I think will make or break some businesses. Thank you so much, and I hope, thank you for your consideration.</td>

                <td>All right, wonderful. Hi, Ivy Moylan. I reside at 54 Lee Street, and I&#39;m calling because I&#39;m the executive director of the Brattle Theater and the Brattle Film Foundation in Harvard Square, one of the businesses that Janice Gilson was directly referring to. And I just urge that the city council members exercise their charter right and delay this tax decision moving forward. 22% tax increase for real estate taxes on commercial real estate specifically is so out of bounds with the normal increase that happens. And although the Brattle is a nonprofit, we don&#39;t own our space. So we do pay real estate taxes. Currently it is 20% of our budget, the real estate taxes that we pay because we&#39;re a large space as many arts nonprofits are. And we pay triple net because our landlord doesn&#39;t pay real estate taxes. It&#39;s passed down to us as everyone has mentioned. And that is pretty standard for most organizations. So the the landlords are not going to be the people who are hurt. And it&#39;s going to disproportionately hurt small businesses and nonprofits. Where is a nonprofit going to find the money for something like this? It isn&#39;t even going to come from retail. It&#39;s going to have to come from fundraising. And is that going to be an option in a time like now? So it&#39;s just, it was sort of a really gobsmacking to get the email about this happening today. And so I really urge you to take serious consideration on this decision. And if it really has to go, I really need some transparency as a resident and a business owner in the city to understand the justification for this out of bounds tax increase to understand why this bill this makes sense to anyone because I don&#39;t, I can&#39;t understand why it makes sense right now. Thank you so much.</td>

                <td> Oh, thank you. Thank you. My name is Raj Danda. My involvement with Harvard Square began in 1998 when I purchased what is referred to or known as Crimson Galleria. And Harvard Square, from so many points of view, the place if you had any interest in real estate and all. Since then, I have fortunately been able to acquire a number of buildings in the square. And what that has given me as we speak today, as I speak today, is perspective of where we are and where we are going. about, I&#39;m going to say, five, maybe a little more than that, eight years ago. It was any national, international, top of the line retailer or business. Almost every time I&#39;d hear about it, many of them established their businesses here. Over time, some have succeeded, some have not so much. But in the last one year, maybe a little more, the demand has gone down significantly. We are not getting the number of inquiries. We&#39;re not getting the rents. And leaving that aside from my point of view, my comment is that it&#39;s so important to have the square be the vibrant place that it was, I&#39;m gonna say, 10 years ago. We are not getting the same inquiries. We&#39;re not getting the same quality at the end of the day. I think the square needs help and if you&#39;re going to Put in a 22% increase which most landlords like me pass on to the tenants but in the big picture the cost of doing business gets that much higher, and therefore, they&#39;re gonna call me and other folks like me and say, Raj, it was a good journey, we are done, thank you. That&#39;s the challenge you have. This would be very, very problematic. Thank you.</td>

I&#39;m a member of the Cambridge Local First. I&#39;m on the board of the Harvard Square Business Association. And I&#39;ve been a business owner for more than 30 years. And regarding the tax rate, not all businesses are affected the same way. I mean, it could be different from neighborhood or even blocks. Small businesses are taking the blunt of this economic downturn. Many are still struggling to recover from the pandemic. And not to mention the terrorist situation is making things worse and it&#39;s just really trickling down. So obviously the time is not great. But, you know, we need more transparency. We need more notice. We can&#39;t just find out day of what&#39;s going on and then mobilize. That&#39;s really unfair to the businesses. and quite honestly, disrespectful to the small business community. So if I miss something or notice, let me know, but I think I&#39;m not the only one. In terms of the, I understand the city needs funds. I mean, this is a situation that as counselors, you need to be fiscally responsible So our expenses are increasing and our revenue is shrinking. That&#39;s the reality. We all need to tighten our belts across the board and not just lean so heavily on the small business community because we&#39;re trying to recover too. So I get it. I acknowledge that. I understand that sacrifices need to be made across the board. um like i said the increase came to my attention just this morning it was announced you know like really late and you know i suggest we table this not just as a charter right because that&#39;s not enough one week we need to um really table it for a really thorough and healthy conversation with the business community We need to analyze the situation, its impact on our businesses, and we just need some grace in relation to this. So thank you for your consideration.</td>

A lot of areas, certainly, but national impacts are a key part of it. Empty offices in Kendall and elsewhere. And that is really important, but don&#39;t go after small businesses. Local businesses have been hit very hard by tariffs. I was just speaking with the owner of Bob Slate. Will these and other stores be able to survive with these additional tariffs? That is something that we really have to think about. I&#39;ll also speak as somebody who&#39;s at a local university and we had to, in our departments, come up with a plan to possibly decrease our expenditures by 20%. So when you have here potentially greater impact in terms of raising taxes, I think it&#39;s time for us to ask the hard question. Ask the city to reduce its expenses by the same 22%. That should be on the table. We can&#39;t simply go on as we are, and we&#39;re heading into much harder times. Let me add that for many homeowners, taxes are also going up dramatically, in part through the upzoning, but for other reasons, and neighbors will be charged even more for taxes, many on fixed incomes. So let&#39;s really put the onus on the city to come up with a plan to reduce its expenditures, the same amount that they&#39;re asking small businesses to provide. We&#39;ve gotta think of equity, we&#39;ve gotta think of the needs of the city as a whole. Thank you.</td>

                <td> Hello, Heather Hoffman, 213 Hurley Street. First, I want to commend the people who wrote this memo for how much information is in it. It&#39;s got so much that people need to understand all of the factors that go into figuring out how the taxes get apportioned. And I wish that the city would have a hearing to lay that out in front of people because it really matters. One of the things I noticed is that we&#39;re eating up more of our excess levy limit. That&#39;s something that should concern people. With respect to the commercial taxes, I may have misunderstood, but I believe that commercial values are coming down by a noticeable amount and the tax rate is going up. So it&#39;s not necessarily that the taxes are going to go up by the same amount as the increase in the rate. Again, you ought to make sure to explain this to people so they&#39;ll know what the real numbers are. With respect to residential taxes, I would love to know how much of this is the upzoning and how much of the much smaller increase in the taxes paid by condos is due to the fact that the split ownership of a condo means that it is less likely to be able to take advantage of that massive upzoning because all of the owners would have to agree. So again, there is a lot that could and should be explained so people really, really understand what goes into this. And finally, with respect to reducing the budget or at least reducing the increase, oh, I would also like an explanation of exactly what contributed to the new growth that&#39;s in the table of new growth. because that&#39;s a large number for residential. And we keep being told no residential being built, but there are things that the city could not do and save money. Think about it. Thank you.</td>

                <td>Oh, thank you for the three minutes. My name is Robert Winters. I live at 366 Broadway. Primarily just a few questions, but first off, I&#39;m a little surprised that people are saying they only learned about this today. The city manager&#39;s letter was available Thursday night. I think anybody could have read it then, so I really agree with that. I think Heather sort of touched upon something I think that really needs to be emphasized, which is that the letter does speak about a 22% increase in the tax rate, but there is, I believe, an 11.5% decrease in commercial values. So I don&#39;t know what that really comes out to. Maybe it&#39;s more like 10, 12% increase, probably. But here&#39;s the catch, is that if I was looking at the residential tax rate, and I&#39;ll speak to that in a minute, I could look at the map of the various tax districts and I could sort of see how, well, what does that really translate into if you&#39;re in, you know, into tax district number three, whatever, because it doesn&#39;t fall uniformly across the board, a particular tax rate increases or decreases. now in regards to the commercial tax rate I can look at that map excuse me for the residential I could look at that map but I can&#39;t tell from this here and I would hope that the folks from the city can speak to this how is the decrease I imagine I&#39;m just guessing now that the decrease in property values commercial values probably was most strongly felt in places like Kendall Square with very high vacancy rates So whereas maybe it&#39;s not true. Maybe the tax, maybe the valuations in just regular neighborhood retail, maybe those valuations were flat, which is they&#39;re going to get hit with the full 22% increase in their tax, not tax rate, but taxes, period. So it would be very helpful, I think, for all of us to hear a word or two about how the decrease in valuations were distributed from Kendall Square, from lab buildings versus neighborhood retail, mom and pop stores, whatever. Because I don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to be the same all across the board. And I really think who&#39;s going to bear the brunt of this is going to vary quite a bit. Those are the main things I wanted to just bring up here, but I do want to say one last thing on the tax rate. The tax bill, never mind the rate, the tax bill, condominiums going up 13.3 percent, single family 10.2 percent, two family 9.2 percent, three family 8.9 percent. Rate of inflation, my friends, is about 2.9 percent. We&#39;re talking about tax increases that are triple the rate of inflation. I would like you to think about it, especially in the context when people take votes like they did last week and many weeks, for new programs, new things that have costs associated with them, and what that&#39;s going to translate into in terms of tax impacts in future years. Are we going to be seeing 20% next? Thank you.</td>

                <td>Thank you so much, Vice Mayor, and thank you all. I think we&#39;ll probably have a more robust conversation about the tax rate this year than usual. Maybe just to set some context and I think provide a bit of the background. I would say first, a reminder in terms of when we actually start the budget process. We really started last year in November and had a conversation about the overall economic environment and how we were thinking about both the economic downturn that we&#39;re going through as a city. We just went through five or ten years of incredible growth that really supported a lot of the budget needs that we&#39;ve invested in, everything from our sewers, streets, bike lanes, schools. universal pre-K, human service programs, all of those were really funded by a lot of the growth that we saw in Kendall Square over those years, and we are really seeing that turning around, and that macroeconomic cycle is going to take a little bit of time for us to get through. We set a much lower operating budget target for FY26 than in prior years. And so we went from budget growth rates of 7, 8, 9%, and for the FY26 budget that we&#39;re voting on the tax rate on tonight, we landed a budget growth of only 3.8%. And that was a significant conversation that we were all having together, both to ensure that we&#39;re able to make this work fiscally, we&#39;re able to invest in a number of the programs that our community really needed, but also understanding that there are constraints that we&#39;re facing. One of the challenges as we were going through that budget process that we&#39;ve been discussing is that even though the operating budget growth was only 3.8%, the tax levy growth is actually much higher than that. And that&#39;s, again, a consequence of the economic cycles. When we were going through, as a community, these years of economic growth, a lot of the other sources of revenues, in particular building permit revenues, are going up really fast. And all of that money essentially means that we don&#39;t have to raise taxes by as much in order to increase health benefits, COLAs, all the program investments that we are making. We&#39;re now seeing a lot of that turnaround, where every year we are actually seeing, and this will continue in the next couple of years, but whatever our operating budget growth is going to be, we&#39;re gonna end up likely needing to raise a tax levy at a higher rate of growth. So for this budget in 26, we had an operating budget that grew at 3.8% and we had a tax levy that was an 8% growth. And that was the vote that the city council approved this past June for the FY26 budget. What we&#39;re now here tonight for is the values that ultimately drive how much we raise and where the tax rates are set come in in the fall. And then we set the tax rates. And so I think these things can both be true. The reality is the commercial tax rate is going up by a lot more than we&#39;re used to. The values are coming down. And so the overall dollar amount that many people will pay is going to be a little bit moderated by changes in the valuations. Now, the other challenge, and I think just to validate a lot of the public comment that came in, there is a real difference across classes. And so within that commercial class, a lot of the biggest value declines are in the larger corporation&#39;s office and lab space where we see persistent vacancies. And so those are the areas where you&#39;re likely going to see much more moderation. So the rate is going up, but their values are coming down, so the overall dollar change is gonna be pretty moderate. And it may be the case, and I think in particular, we&#39;re sharing a bit more data tonight, but in some segments, like hotels in particular, the values have actually been pretty stable, which means that they&#39;re going to see a much higher dollar increase in line with the increase in the rate. In terms of what we&#39;re actually discussing tonight, really the votes are to decide on first, we&#39;ve always used a split rate. So most communities that have a strong enough commercial sector use a split tax rate. And so we have one rate for commercial and one rate for residential. And I think that will continue. The part of that that&#39;s the vote is how much we&#39;re shifting. So what is the percent that we&#39;re going to charge commercial versus residential? And state law essentially allows us to charge a higher rate for commercial than residential, hence why you want a split rate. And we have always consistently as a community prioritized a lower residential tax rate. And so in the case of this conversation tonight, consistent with how we&#39;ve approached this every year, we are proposing a shift where last year commercial was taxed at 140% of the residential rate and this year commercial will be taxed at 152%. That is mostly to protect the residential rates and the residential taxpayers. If we were to keep that at 140%, we would see significantly higher residential tax rates and we&#39;re happy to sort of share more of those numbers. But that&#39;s been the policy that this council and the administration has pursued for a really, really long time. I think just the other note in terms of process is, um you know we can sort of answer a lot more questions tonight but the decisions that really drove this uh were part of the budget process and the overall amount that we need to raise ends up driving how the rates play out and there are a lot of structural constraints you know we don&#39;t get to say that we want to charge certain small businesses less and certain labs or corporations more it really is this commercial versus residential rate and then uh and then this is kind of how it plays out across the classes um i would probably say we&#39;ve got a lot of expertise at this table um i&#39;d love to get through all of your questions and be able to provide any more data that we can uh and and we can maybe go from there um before we go on on a motion by counselor toner to close public comment roll call</td>

We&#39;re at a place tonight where the only vote is just how do we balance the two, not can we scale programs back or anything like that. My next question is that we heard about this 22% rate, right? I just wanted to confirm something, which is that, and I think the city manager mentioned this a little bit, because the rate is based on the value of a property and the property values are going down, the rate can go up, but that&#39;s not how much more you&#39;re paying in taxes. I don&#39;t know, if you paid $100 in taxes last year, if the average is going up by 8%, you might be paying 108, even though it&#39;s a higher rate. So it might only go up 8% on average, is that right for commercial?</td>

                <td>I would say, I think as through you, Vice Mayor, the city managers point earlier that as we the values across commercial did decrease across the entire class by about twelve and a half percent i think the assessors can can go more deeply in this but it did not impact um... within the classification properties in the same way so values for labs decreased significantly for instance but hotels did not and so across the class we are going to raise 8% more taxes. But how it will be felt across the class will be different. And so some taxpayers may indeed feel a 22% increase if their value stayed exactly the same as last year and the rate increased by 22%. And yet if your value fell by 15%, you won&#39;t experience a 22% increase. Councillor Azeem.</td>

                <td> Through you, Vice Mayor. I think I would also add that it does depend on what type of property it is. So the office and lab classes have had the greatest decreases. Retail, slightly down, no more than 3%, but hotels have actually gone slightly up, somewhere between 1% and 3%. How that does play out is the hotels will take the full brunt of that plus the value increase. And you can see on where we did an example chart as a handout tonight, because there were so many questions, to give people some idea of how this plays out across the different classes. So I would say retail, restaurant, hotel will feel more of the brunt of the higher tax rate. It will be less felt by the lab and office, and that&#39;s just shifts within the commercial class.</td>

It&#39;s going to be different by sectors, but on average, like, it&#39;s 8%. So not, like, people are not going to see their taxes on average jump by 22%. Obviously, some might.

So unless there&#39;s something dramatically different that happens between now and the end of the year, I think that we&#39;re in a holding pattern. There is... Too much lab space. There is too much office space. People have changed the way that they have worked. And this isn&#39;t just a Cambridge problem. This really is a regional problem, that regionally there&#39;s just too much space in these particular areas of lab and commercial, lab and office.</td>

                <td>If I were to just extend that, I would say, I think, thank you, Gail. We are sort of expecting these economic trends to continue. What we&#39;re experiencing today is what Boston is not able to do anymore because they&#39;ve hit that limit. And so, I think these are the challenges that when we&#39;re, the vote tonight is really about the commercial residential shift. And our policy has been to prioritize lower residential tax rates. One of the things that we discussed last November and that I think we&#39;ll continue to be discussing is we&#39;re currently proposing as part of this shift, we&#39;ll be at 152%, 175% is the max. And once you hit that, you can&#39;t increase the commercial anymore and you&#39;re essentially at a single tax rate. where all the burden of the increase will be on residential. And even more if actually what happens is if commercial value continue to come down and residential rates are flatter increasing, you&#39;re gonna see an even greater burden on the residential side. And so if you think about the levers that we have, Some of the challenges on this front is you&#39;re really just shifting tax burden between commercial and residential. Part of the strategy that we&#39;re trying to find from a fiscal perspective is to moderate some of that growth so that the tax burden and the increase isn&#39;t so high. moderating our overall budget growth is really the best way to ensure that we don&#39;t end up with too big a jump during the economic downturn. And when there&#39;s economic growth again, it&#39;ll be easier to find those new revenues. It&#39;ll be easier to make investments. So I think that that&#39;s part of the broader story that I think we&#39;re continuing to work through, but we haven&#39;t seen significant economic changes since we last talked. In fact, I think as Gail was saying, mostly we&#39;re seeing a continued downturn and it&#39;ll be a little bit before we come out of that.</td>

First, I just wanted to comment and say, well, at least in the lab and office space, I think it may not be what we wanted, but it&#39;s just interesting to hear that we built so much that the property values have gone down, which we&#39;re always talking about with regards to housing. My final question was just about the excess levy capacity. I think we often hear we could be going higher, funding more services. I was just wondering, what is the status of our levy capacity? And where do we think that it&#39;s headed now?</td>

                <td> Yes, through you, Vice Mayor. Within the memo, I think we have a chart that shows our excess levy capacity over the last maybe four or five years, and it is on page seven. And this is an actual, we can see here that our excess levy capacity this year, FY26, the estimate with the setting of the tax rate, that our excess levy capacity will be at 172 million. which is actually a decrease of 8.6 percent from what our excess levy capacity was last year and you can see 25 we actually had a decrease and in 24 we had a decrease and so yes you know that has allowed us to actually set a tax rate uh or a levy increase at eight percent and we have sort of gone into our savings account called excess levy capacity in order to set a tax rate to balance our budget without having to do reductions. We can do scenarios out for five or six years, particularly if an economic downturn persists for a number of years. and that new growth, as you noted, the new growth was about 40% less than the new growth last year. When we&#39;re not adding new growth into our tax base, that means that we&#39;re not fully replenishing our excess levy capacity with what we spend in that year. It is there for these kinds of times, right, when there is an economic downturn. We are actually a very lucky community in that we have those and we are not forced to make precipitous reductions. But it is also one of those things that we talk about a lot, right, our necessity to maintain our financial flexibility by trying to maintain a certain amount of excess levy capacity. And I think to the city manager&#39;s point, our biggest lever is ultimately our budget growth. And in the times when the economics are not in our favor, we should be trying to moderate budget growth. And then when the economics turn around for us, we can again begin to think about additional expansion of programs. Councilor Azeem.</td>

                <td> Thank you. First, a couple confirming questions. Thanks for putting this together, and I do want to point out one of the things I think all of us were wondering about, and it&#39;s very helpful. It hasn&#39;t been talked about as much as the commercial rate examples of a commercial tax rate by category, because I think that&#39;s really critically important for all of us to understand that The impact overall might be X percent, 22% on the rate, but the impact overall on the actual payment is probably more on the order of 8 to 10%, as we had during those budget discussions. But by class, it can range from anywhere from your actual bill will go up from 1% to 25%, depending on your category, or it may be 30 or 40%. That&#39;s really important to understand, and I think it&#39;s why it&#39;s a message that I hope we take the time. I think we might, in order to ensure that even though this was kind of discussed in June, so many of our business community and our commercial folks throughout the city just got a shocking, oh my gosh, it&#39;s going up 22%. It&#39;s not. However, we do need to explain, and I think we should take the time to do that. I do want to ask one thing I heard. We&#39;re talking about the commercial versus the residential rates. My understanding is that we can&#39;t actually, we know we can&#39;t have different rates for small locally owned businesses versus big national change. Many of us, I would like to, we can&#39;t. Can we even have any distinction, which I don&#39;t think we can, but I want to confirm between retail versus office versus lab or is it just all one category? I just think it would be helpful to confirm to people because a lot of people have come to us and said, can&#39;t you do this for us? And my reply is I&#39;m pretty sure we can&#39;t.</td>

And I think this is meant to be the tax rate hearing. So I think there is a need certainly to have engagement with especially the businesses that are saying, oh, this is a really high rate. It&#39;s turning out based on the valuations that we&#39;re really seeing an impact. I think this is the moment when we&#39;ve got the full valuations. We&#39;re able to calculate the tax rates. We release them publicly and then we have the conversation with the council. And so I think I think this is the moment when people are supposed to hear and then give us feedback, which I think we&#39;re getting. And I think this is always helpful for us to both incorporate as we think about how we can make some of this data more clear and also how we incorporate this into the next budget process. But I&#39;m seeing nodding from Taha, so I think I got that right. We don&#39;t typically release information before this hearing because this is meant to be the hearing where we bring forward the tax rate information.</td>

                <td> no that&#39;s an excellent point um vice mayor chair mcgovern um i understand the timing it&#39;s challenging and yet i think next year any time we can do it to say yes we&#39;re having the hearing and 10 days before the hearing we&#39;re going to put the information out so people know i understand we don&#39;t have to have We can&#39;t do it until we&#39;ve had the rates and we understand the valuation, but it just ends up being something that people who have really busy lives and understandably it affects their lives. Now, I actually think in general that classification is good news for many of the folks who are concerned about it and that we see for office, if this is an example of general commercial tax rate, offices, actual percent change in dollars is, The valuation went down 17%, but the percent change in actual dollars they&#39;ll probably pay is only 1% more. And for labs, it&#39;s 7% more. And retail, restaurant, it is 11% more. So still, that&#39;s four times inflation. So it&#39;s still, for those folks, a big increase. And then for hotels, it&#39;s 25%. I think the more we can do to make sure that once we have it set, we have a communication, you know, we have business associations, we have the Kendall Square Association, the Chamber and all these others to say, hey, we&#39;re going to have the hearing and it&#39;s going to be in 10 days, you know, not on Monday before a weekend when people may not have gotten it. And I know it&#39;s hard to get this information. It just means it&#39;s all going to be in the spirit of kind of transparency for us. I will say at this meeting, as Councilor Azeem said, it really is a question of the residential versus commercial. We do want to honor that, and I do want to note, as we had those budget hearings in June, it&#39;s a really high increase for everybody, including many of our residential. For the average single family, two family, three family, it&#39;s as much as an 11% increase in the average tax bill. I mean, it is... It is high, and it&#39;s something for some people. It really will affect them for if they own a three-decker and they&#39;re going to have to increase the rent for people. So even though we&#39;ve heard mostly about the commercial tax rate, this is also something to consider for the residential tax rate. And is there a way that we can shift that? I will say, if we see more residential development, taxes won&#39;t necessarily go up. That&#39;s where the new growth will come from. And in fact, taxes could stay the same, correct? Yes, that&#39;s correct. Because that&#39;s something we also heard. Oh my gosh, this multifamily zoning, as all these houses are being built, your property tax are going to go up. Regardless of how you feel about it, if we had all that development, we&#39;ve already seen that new development actually holds taxes even and steady because it provides opportunity for us to fill in budget gaps. And I do have one other question, which is we would have the option if we so chose, and if this was a calamitous review that we found out taxes were going to have to go up 80%, we could mid-year correct on our budget if we so choose. I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s easier we would ever do that, but that is something that would be possible, correct?</td>

                <td> I understand. I&#39;m just being clear. And particularly for the future, it means setting up for next year. If we don&#39;t want to see this kind of thing, we need to be very conscious and cognizant of the levers we do have. And frankly, what we may be facing, given the headwinds that we&#39;re entering, we&#39;ve already seen this decline of commercial overall down 15%, labs down 10% in value. That may not change. Our largest employer is going through layoffs and are really incredibly difficult financial times. And we know what&#39;s going on at the other end of Mass Ave with a $300 million hit to an endowment from MIT that&#39;s going to really affect us. So I hope that we have a chance to communicate this more broadly. And again, I think it is good news if people actually look at it. It&#39;s at least better than the idea of everybody is gonna see a 22% increase. But for anyone with a triple net lease, it is going to hit them. And if I&#39;m looking at this as exempt for retail restaurant, it won&#39;t be 22%. But if it&#39;s an 11% increase in your taxes and you&#39;re already on the edge, it&#39;s certainly something that is causing some question. Just one final question. Are these actual examples or is this the overall view that we have? I&#39;m referring to the examples of commercial tax rate. I&#39;m really glad to see this because we get it on the single family, two family condos. We haven&#39;t had it typically for this breakdown. I think it should be included in any future developments as we move forward. But is this typical or is this just everything we&#39;ve seen that we know will happen with commercial?</td>

It also depends on what&#39;s the mix of the property.

                <td> Vice Mayor? Mr. Banjo. Just to provide a bit of additional color in terms of what we&#39;re sort of seeing in this downturn, and I think this does relate to we have the lowest commercial tax rate of all of our neighboring cities. I think the reason is because we&#39;ve seen so much growth in a lot of the office and especially the office and lab market. And so, you know, what we&#39;re seeing is the reverse of what we experienced over the last five to 10 years. over the last five to 10 years, office and lab were growing so quickly. Those values were going up so much that they really took on a lot of the burden. And so a lot of our small businesses did not see significant tax increases because they were buffered from that. And so that&#39;s why our rate is actually very low. And then as the economy is turned around, that&#39;s the challenge, that when those values come down, then it sort of flips. And then we&#39;re seeing, especially for the hotel class right now, if those values are stable, they&#39;re getting, as Gail noted, the full brunt of the rate increase. So I think it doesn&#39;t change, I think, the experience of a lot of the small businesses that are going to see a pretty significant increase. I don&#39;t think most of them will see 22%, but it won&#39;t be the same 1%, 2%, 3% increase or sort of the experience that we&#39;ve had over the last 10 years.</td>

                <td> Yeah, obviously, I understand that. And it also, just like for our housing, our rate is really low, the chart is in here, and yet if your value&#39;s high, the amount you&#39;re paying makes up for that. So we are still needing close to a billion dollars of an operating budget, 60%, right, or 58% comes from our property levy. 33% of that is from residents. The other comes from commercial. So that&#39;s a lot of money we have to raise. So even if the rate is relatively low, when the values continue to go up, then the taxes can go up. So those are my comments. Thank you. I yield.</td>

I think the shock to the system is because the increase is so high, 22%, and also because electricity bills are going up, gas bills are going up, and we know water sewer bills are going up. People are going to be spending a lot more as part of the cost of business. But what I&#39;m wondering, and again, I still am fairly new to this. So when we were talking about the residential tax levy in June, did you know that the commercial tax levyâ would be could you have modeled that it would be about 22 percent because i think it would have been so i&#39;d love to hear that but i i just i think it would have been useful in our budget discussions if we had understood the implications of the of the budget decisions that we were making Because maybe we wouldn&#39;t have committed to spending so much money if we realized that the commercial tax rate would have to go up so high. So my question is, could we have modeled that the commercial tax levy would have been about 22% in June?</td>

They&#39;re paying the same percentage. They&#39;re going up 8%. Residential&#39;s going up 8%. We did know earlier that commercial values were looking like they&#39;re gonna decline, but it wasn&#39;t really until the end of the summer where we knew how much we were gonna settle on, and then once we put those numbers in and are approved with the DOR that we really have what that rate is gonna be.</td>

So we&#39;re talking about fiscal year 25, so the taxes that we&#39;re going to pay, the property taxes going forward, will be based on property evaluations. of the last year, right? Yeah, so anyway, so I think if, so maybe there&#39;s some way this coming year that we can talk more candidly. I mean, if it seems clear that property values are gonna continue to remain low and growth will continue to be arrested or slow, it would just be good for the council to understand what the implications would be for taxation. And then I just, so then I just had some questions about, so I know one of the things you want us to vote on are that we keep the five classifications classes for property tax levy. So are industrial and commercial properties separate or are they together? I&#39;m really confused on page six. It sounds like industrial property, we have tremendous growth in industrial property, but what is that? And then we&#39;ve got quite a bit of growth in residential property. So what is that, and how is industrial separate from commercial?</td>

So we&#39;re not picking everything up in one year. It&#39;s continuing as they&#39;re finishing out the building. So each year as of January 1st, we&#39;re determining what&#39;s the status and we&#39;re saying how much further along are they, how much does that affect the growth, and then we&#39;re capturing that as new growth because the Prop 2 1â2 is you can raise your levy by 2 1â2% plus new growth.</td>

                <td> Through you, Vice Mayor. I think I would say because it&#39;s such a long construction time for a lot of the large buildings, we certainly are still seeing new growth in Kendall Square. We have headquarters that are being built there. That is a huge part of the new growth. We also have the Volpe site. That is that moves forward. That will be a large amount of new growth. We certainly have stuff happening in Alewife. There are certainly lots of permits that have been pulled. Whether people will move forward on those is uncertain, I think, at this point. And I think the other thing I would say is a lot of the buildings, these large office and lab buildings, if they do not have a tenant at this point, they will not move forward on fitting out the interior. So those buildings really are at 70% complete. We are not moving forward to 100%. We&#39;re not capturing that new growth. So if you think about the courthouse, which I don&#39;t know if you did the tour when they opened the building, you went inside and it&#39;s raw space. And it is because tenants are very particular about what they want. And so no landlord wants to fit it out and then pay to fit it out and then rip it all out to get exactly what the tenant wants. And so I think that that&#39;s another piece of the new growth that we are losing.</td>

                <td>Thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor. First of all, I want to thank the city manager and the staff because quite honestly, none of this is shocking to me. I understand people feel like they were surprised with the posting of this information, but the three prior years I&#39;ve been on the council, this is what we do every year. I think the challenge is always we build a budget, vote on a budget, and then we figure out how much the actual dollar amount is that people are getting in their tax bill, which is the surprise. I do want to point out that Councilor Nolan and I, while I was still co-chair of the Finance Committee and the Council, made it pretty clear to the city that we can&#39;t keep having 8%, 9% tax increases. And they, through their due diligence in this process, the actual operating budget is only going up by 3.8%. But in order to pay the bills for all the things we&#39;ve accumulated over the years, at least for the past last year and this year and maybe for a little while longer, the increases in the revenues we have to bring in are going to be higher than that. The balance is, and this is for everybody in the public, I mean, a number of people wrote to us saying, I love my small business, don&#39;t raise their taxes. We&#39;re not raising the small business taxes. We&#39;re having to make a decision about raising taxes on properties across the city, residential and commercial. and then how that gets divvied up between the different types of properties and who&#39;s paying, whether it&#39;s the tenants or the property owner wants to absorb it completely themselves, that&#39;s all outside of the city&#39;s purview. But to the residents, and believe me, I&#39;m empathetic to all the businesses as well, I wanna see them survive and thrive here, but every resident who writes to us and says, don&#39;t raise the property taxes on commercial, well, okay. because you&#39;re the very same people who say don&#39;t raise my residential property tax, which leaves us in the bind where I hear what Ms. Spinner says. Yes, I guess legally we could go back and try to undo some of our decisions in the budget, but that&#39;s gonna mean layoffs, cutting programs, real hurt to people within this budget cycle, which I don&#39;t think any of us wanna do. And I know some people think I&#39;m this Scrooge when we have the budget conversations. I&#39;m not. I&#39;ve been saying it all along. I don&#39;t think we should be taking on new programs. We have enough on our plate just to be able to tread water with the programs that we do. And we do a lot in Cambridge, things that nobody else does. I mean, most places do recycling pickup once every two weeks. They don&#39;t take large items with you. We don&#39;t have UPK and other cities and towns. There&#39;s a lot of things we do in the city of Cambridge, lots of social services we provide and lots of non-profits we support and fund. Those are all things that before you set a budget next year, I just want to remember the heat you&#39;re taking right now from people saying don&#39;t raise my commercial property tax, don&#39;t raise my residential property tax, because the only way that&#39;s not going to happen And it is going to happen, unless you come to a screeching halt and make some cuts at the same time. It is going to happen. But as the council, whoever the future council is next year, makes those decisions, I hope you remember this conversation tonight. I am going to, I&#39;m not going to say it yet, I just want to say one other thing is that I think because of the way it came out, and again, I&#39;m not blaming the staff, this is how it always happens, that some people are surprised. Some people got emails saying this is an emergency meeting or crisis meeting that we&#39;re doing this with no notice to anybody. That&#39;s not true. This, again, is the way things happen. And I personally believe the staff for a whole year has been forecasting that this is generally what&#39;s going to happen. But with that, I would like to have another two weeks for us to be able to Let people settle down, absorb the information. I don&#39;t know, maybe the staff has a Zoom call with the business associations to answer their questions, et cetera, so they can answer the questions of their membership. But I also know from Ms. Spinner that we can&#39;t wait more than two weeks because after that, the money runs out. SO WE&#39;RE GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION BY OCTOBER 20th, AND THERE&#39;S, YOU KNOW, I DOUBT WE&#39;RE GOING TO SIT HERE AND TALK ABOUT MAKING BUDGET CUTS OR INCREASING RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY TAXES, BUT I&#39;LL LET THE CITY MANAGER, LOOKS LIKE HE WANTS TO SAY SOMETHING OR ARE YOU JUST TWIDDLING YOUR FINGERS? I DON&#39;T KNOW. WITH THAT, I&#39;D LIKE TO EXERCISE MY CHARTER RIGHT TO GIVE US TWO WEEKS TO THINK ABOUT IT. THANK YOU.</td>

We are not seeing the same amount of direct activity in the city of Cambridge, but I do appreciate the policy order and the need for us to get more organized. And I hope this response appreciate the work that city staff have done just to go line by line and talk through how we&#39;re engaging and supporting folks in the community.

It was just brief, they didn&#39;t ask us for anything. We didn&#39;t do anything, but we did see them in our city. And then also there was an ICE interaction where they came in and used our bathroom on September 12th and then said hi to the clerk, do you have any information? They said we do not cooperate with ICE. So those are the only two additional interactions that we&#39;ve had since our last report. Councilor Wilson.</td>

Now, I know we don&#39;t have our superintendent available, but just curious about where are we at? Are we hearing anything about just the fears and worries on the ground? Anyone from our Department of Human Services or anything that are just seeing a decline in any of our numbers, schools, after school programs, anything of that sort? Is that for me?</td>

                <td> Yeah, happy to. Hi, Anne. Nice to see you. And through you, Vice Mayor McGovern, thank you for this opportunity to respond to this policy order. It&#39;s nice to see you all. I&#39;m just now returning back from maternity leave as of a week ago. So I really appreciate everyone that came together to help me keep this work moving along while I was away. And just to kind of... you know, I could piggyback on what Ian said that, you know, we&#39;re hearing a lot of concerns from our community members who are scared. Our goal with CERC is to remain a hub of information. So we do continuously update our website with resources. We are in the process of specifically creating resources for after hours assistance, including some of the organizations that have listed in this memo. We wanted to also Just to remind folks that we do have a 24-7 interpretation hotline for staff to use through our Language Justice Division, and that covers over 100 languages. And we found that this hotline has been very effective meeting community needs, and that&#39;s specifically for staff. Then we have a separate public-facing hotline for community members. And that right now, really, we&#39;re continuing with the Know Your Rights trainings, with meeting with our community partners, AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE CITY IS REALLY LOOKING FOR BOTH LEGAL SERVICES, SO WE&#39;RE ALWAYS IN CLOSE CONNECTION WITH DENOVO, WITH OUR LEGAL CLINIC, AS WELL AS OTHER ORGANIZATIONS THAT PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SUPPORTS. SO REALLY I WOULD ENCOURAGE, YOU KNOW, THE PUBLIC AND OTHERS TO CONTINUE REACHING OUT TO CERC FOR DIRECT HELP AND GUIDANCE AS WE CONTINUE THIS IMPORTANT WORK.</td>

I also wanted to share that we have been in contact with the Massachusetts Office for Refugees and Immigrants at the state level, and they will be providing bystander intervention trainings, both for city staff and residents and those trainings will take place in a few weeks. So those are the next set of trainings we will do and then our plan is to then kind of reassess and see what other training options we should offer.</td>

I don&#39;t need any specifics tonight, but maybe I can follow up with you directly and just see, because I&#39;d be curious if they need more than a part-time person in the future, but just wanted to get a sense of that. But I think it&#39;s important that we did that. And that&#39;s one thing we were able to enhance given what&#39;s happening and really what&#39;s to come. So just wanted to make that comment.

Just quickly, in the Cambridge Public Schools right now, we&#39;re not seeing a lot of attrition, but we&#39;re also not seeing a lot of newcomers either. So there&#39;s nothing. So I know there&#39;s the feeling that our students not coming to school anymore. That is not the case. but we did see a slowing of newcomers coming into our schools. In terms of trainings and things of that nature, and City Manager may have already spoken about this, given the circumstance we had just recently, and I want to just thank Carolina and her office and many, many others that kind of came together to help this one family, we learned a few things. One of the things is that there&#39;s certain things that we don&#39;t know and certain things that we have to do better. I know that there was some conversation about having a bystander training. I think that&#39;s still going forward. But in addition, there are things that we could do to assist our families in that we weren&#39;t necessarily doing. So we&#39;re beginning to talk about that, not only for the schools, but what I call frontline folks, people that sit at the front desk of any organization that get confronted with the presence of ICE, what they should do. So we are very vigilant, we&#39;re paying attention, and we&#39;re trying to do as much as we can as fast as we can. in the event that we do have a rush of ICE presence in our community. So I yield the floor.</td>

I want to express thanks for the fact that we are coordinating services with others that in order to do this more quickly, we&#39;re coordinating as the memo states that Luce already has this 24-hour and Bijan have a family hotline. I&#39;m really glad that we are coordinating collaborating with existing organizations because that allowed us to do it much more quickly and that if they can use our language justice hotline, it just seems like that&#39;s a really good model for us as we build on what others are already doing successfully and moving forward to protect our most vulnerable, these residents who are being ripped off the streets. I do have a question on the statistical breakdown, the ICE interactions. I understand that none of these detainer requests or administrative warrants, we would not get notice of someone just walking down the street or ICE performing on the street. We had some reports that they were going into H Mart or others. We would not get that right. So that would not be captured by this, or am I wrong on that?</td>

And so I just, I do wanna implore folks in the community that we can&#39;t, every time you see an SUV or you see something, you can&#39;t assume it&#39;s ICE and you don&#39;t wanna get in a situation where it&#39;s sort of, what&#39;s the kid&#39;s story? Calling Wolf and whatever. Because when you go online and you say ICE is at this location, people get rightfully really concerned and really scared. And if that&#39;s not true, it continues to give the impression. I mean, so far, right, there&#39;s been an uptick from last year. We see that in the numbers, not a huge one. But, you know, knock on wood, so far we have been â under the radar compared to a lot of our neighboring communities. And so, you know, that doesn&#39;t, I don&#39;t want to give people a false sense of security either because this could all change two minutes from now, right? Especially with this administration. And so, you know, I don&#39;t want to sort of pretend that, oh, don&#39;t worry about it. It&#39;s not going to happen here. It&#39;s probably going to happen here at some point in much bigger numbers. Flip side of that is I also don&#39;t want people being afraid of things that aren&#39;t actually happening. So if it&#39;s Luce that they call or it&#39;s the police that they call, confirm, have someone confirm it before you go out and say ICE is in a particular location. Last question for me, and if you said this in your opening, I&#39;m sorry. The person who was abducted by ICE for the shoplifting coming out of the police department. That&#39;s not, was that after August&#39;s or after what this report covers?</td>

So the example where the person was picked up, that was after they had left the police report. It wasn&#39;t the police report turning them over to ICE. So that&#39;s why they&#39;re not captured on this report.</td>

Through you, Vice Mayor, I believe that the process as stipulated by the ordinance is that we forward the recommendations to the Housing Committee and then it comes back. I do know that there was a request from Elaine DeRosa, the chair of the Housing Authority, who couldn&#39;t be here today, and also Mike Johnson, the executive director to, I believe we did this with the Cambridge Video Development Authority, but to suspend the rules to accept the appointments just because they are seeking to meet quorum requirements. As you can see, we&#39;ve got two vacancies that we&#39;re filling at this point. And then certainly if there&#39;s a housing committee that would like to discuss this, that could also be scheduled.</td>

And I was just sort of shocked at how much salt was in the water in comparison to the MWRA water supply. I wanted to ask whether MassDOT is part of the study group. I was looking at the map, and I hadn&#39;t realized that the Hobbs-Brooks reservoir is so close to 95 and Costco and Route 2. So it&#39;s really close to a lot of big roads. So is MassDOT part of it? And then I just wanted to hear more about brine. Is brine working as part of the goal to encourage all these communities to use brine instead of salt when there are icy roads?

So to answer your question, yes, we have letters of support from all of the surrounding towns on the watershed, also MassDOT, whom we&#39;ve been working with for months now. at least two decades on salt reduction in because of you know in the 20s and 30s they built a highway right literally cuts our stony brook reservoir right in half so You know, initially the DOT&#39;s response when we asked for salt reduction was, you know, when icy roads happen, you know, we have an acute problem where people crash and, you know, can be injured or even cause death. So they were reluctant at first, but we&#39;ve worked with them. New technologies have come out, as you had just mentioned, the brine. Our superintendent of streets here for the city of Cambridge, he and his staff have implemented a brine program, as most cities and towns have started to do. But yes, that&#39;s one of the areas we&#39;re gonna look at with this technical advisory group at encouraging using brine and things like that. uh you know so the dot is is doing the best they can we&#39;ve also you know on their highway construction have started to build drainage basins um that collect the salt uh you know and collect you know contaminants off the roadway and prevent them from getting into our reservoirs which helps uh but as you As you stated about Costco, like Cambridge, that area along 12895 in our watershed has seen tremendous growth over the past decade or so. And a lot of those, because it was open space, were large commercial properties with large impervious surfaces that had been put in. Typically, in the wintertime, because they want to make it safe for people to walk and drive into their property, they, of course, load it up with salt. Part of the goal of this grant is to develop that technical advisory group. MassDOT, Child&#39;s River Watershed Association, Boston Properties, DCR, and some other businesses out that way that have given us a lot of support and have at least initially agreed to be part of the process. So, that&#39;s part of what this grant is for, is for us to do that and then develop a mitigation plan. So, study where the concentrations of salts are coming from, if we can, and then to help uh... you know develop mitigation strategies and plans uh... that we can then present in a report to uh... the nasty p uh... with the hopes of eventually that you know this is for the study the six oh four b grants up for the study uh... and hopefully you know we can find places that we can take some action or at least do some work. And eventually we hope to apply for their Section 319 grant, which would actually give us funding to take some action on salt mitigation.</td>

No, because there is an important part of this, which is this body has often talked about the fact that MWA water, the chlorides in our system, it&#39;s not that it&#39;s not safe and meet the standards. but it is something we hear about consistently particularly from cafes and other folks with equipment that it is because of the high chloride content that there is often less useful life for many appliances and for coffee baristas it&#39;s been a real problem and folks have come here to talk about it so this sounds like it&#39;s going to be one of the steps in addressing that which is really important for us to move forward on. Is this something that we have any sense that other cities across the snow belt have actually managed to address and to decrease significantly the number of chlorides? Because as they come into our water supply, it&#39;s something that is going to be very challenging for us to address if we don&#39;t have other solutions.</td>

So it is definitely becoming more popular. most cities and towns are adopting that. Councilor Nolan.</td>

Also, is there any correlation with the fact that we are seeing increasing number of droughts? The concentration of the water means that the chloride will likely continue to go up. So is that factored into our discussions for the technical advisory group? If that makes sense, because we know. I&#39;m not sure where Habsburg is today, but we&#39;ve seen increasing number of droughts, even as we see increasing extreme weather events.</td>

One of the things we will absolutely be talking about is how future weather and the more frequent drought situations that we are seeing affect the salt industry. And yes, it definitely has an effect. A lot of the salt is actually coming through groundwater when we have groundwater intrusion as well. So it&#39;s coming from the surrounding areas, which obviously becomes more concentrated when we&#39;re in a drought. To use an old term that&#39;s not as popular anymore, the solution to pollution is dilution, right? So yes, when we have more water in our reservoirs, that salt concentration goes down.</td>

So I understand, so they got a million dollars through sort of Ayanna Pressley, I think, and 150,000 from the Cambridge Redevelopment Authority. With this money, will they have the money to completely implement their plans and create their resiliency hub? And that&#39;s through you, Chair McGovern, to the city manager or deputy city manager.

There is more that the center will need to do in terms of HVAC, electric kitchen, more weatherization, but we are continuing to work with them on fundraising and support from like the Cambridge River Development Authority. So it is a team effort. It&#39;s modular. So they now have the funds to complete this part of the project, but the overall project&#39;s more like four and a half million for a total overhaul of the building, which will make it resilient and energy efficient and net zero.</td>

Because generally, at least my assumption is, a lot of the people that came and worked in those buildings are the types that are making 100, 120, 150,000. might not actually qualify for affordable housing. And so what exactly is the nexus between building high-end office and lab space or commercial space and the need for more affordable housing? Who wants it?</td>

                <td>Mr. Cotter. through you, Vice Mayor McGovern. So the study, we assume that the study will follow the same methodology that we&#39;ve used the last two studies. And the 2019 study looked at projected new development in the city over the course of five to 10 years and looked at the types of jobs that we would expect to find in that development. And you&#39;re right, a lot of the development that was projected included labs and offices with jobs that were expected to be higher income jobs. But there are also a good number of jobs that are what we call lower middle skill jobs for which job training could be helpful for helping folks access the jobs and for income ranges where workers would qualify for affordable housing. So the report looked at that and projected out the number of jobs expected to be in that development, modeling it after development that we had seen, number of employees, the types of jobs, the income there, and then determine the number of housing units of different types at different income levels that would be needed to house folks that would be in need of affordable housing in those new buildings, and then quantify that up to work it back to a rate that would be the contribution rate that would be necessary to fund the local portion of the cost of building that affordable housing.</td>

How many folks accept a job in Cambridge then desire to move to Cambridge to get a sense as to what the proportion of workers that are working in Cambridge would be looking for housing and potentially could be in need of affordable housing to understand what that proportion would be. And the last, the 2019 study did not include that survey. The survey was last done in 2015, and we noted it because it&#39;s an important component to do now, given changes that we&#39;ve seen in employment and patterns over the last several years.</td>

And obviously, if things are different, it would change some of those assumptions. But I know that the discussion earlier about the commercial development and new growth in the study, and I&#39;d expect that we would look at this again. One of the considerations for the recommendations that come from the consultant team would be looking at competitiveness and looking at the regional context for these types of exactions. So we would expect that the consultant would model development based upon the current climate or the climate in place in 26 when we expect the study to be underway. And then that would come back with information that could be different than what we see. Thank you. I yield. Councilor Zizek.</td>

To your questions, Councilor Zusy, the report itself won&#39;t necessarily look at the full universe of job training programs, but certainly city staff would be able to provide that and it could be referenced in the discussion because it is relevant. The report would be looking to the, establish the basis for creating a jobs training linkage requirement and what the funds would be kind of in the same way that the housing contribution would be derived. So looking at more of the need for job training based upon employment targets in those new buildings with jobs that are in that low to middle skill range and then looking at the demand i think you&#39;re asking about the existing demand of housing compared to the demand from uh new development so that the study will be looking at the demand for affordable housing generated from new development because that&#39;s where we&#39;re looking to make the link to establish the nexus to be able to uh have that contribution required of new development. Looking at demand for housing more broadly gets a little bit more difficult to establish the clear basis and link between new development and the broader implications in the housing market.</td>

I think what we wanted to do is just note some of the things that we recall from the discussion the last time the council considered the incentive provisions. And note affirmatively that we would expect the study to look at some of those and give some examples of those just so that you&#39;re aware of the approach that we plan to take the study. The example you noted on page four is really just a kind of a simple example to show how a marginal fee might look. This is not intended to be suggestive of what we expect the outcome to be or how that approach would be, but more just to say if there were such a marginal fee that would change based upon the size of the project, this is one way that it could look, just to be clear about what we mean when we&#39;re describing a marginal fee approach.</td>

                <td> Thank you so much. Again, just a final comment. Anyway, I think it&#39;s great this study is going to happen. I am worried about our high linkage fee. I think like Councilor Toner may have suggested some concern, it is $36.36 per square foot now. When in Somerville, it&#39;s $22.46. In Boston, it&#39;s $30.78 for lab and $23.09 for other. And in Watertown, it&#39;s $11.50. So we really don&#39;t want to Price ourselves out of development. We we want the development to continue to happen here And I am all for more money for job training programs, but I am really eager for to us to better understand I know we had the program where we heard about job training programs, but I just I still would like to I would like for there to be a better evaluation of existing programs and how we can, what&#39;s working, what isn&#39;t working, and how we can work more effectively before we add more money to our current linkage fee.

But I just wanted to say I think that besides what the exact number is, what&#39;s most important to me is that we have like a continuous function or a marginal rate, right? I think that this is the same way that income taxes work, where if someone is building 100,000, you know, 99,999 square feet, at $20 a square feet, they&#39;re going to pay $2 million-ish. if they add like five extra square feet they&#39;re gonna pay two and a half million so no there&#39;s gonna be a dead zone in every situation where you have that jump unless that jump is just for the additional square feet and so just to say that like more than what the specific number is it would really be nice to not incentivize dead zones in development and like i think that that&#39;s something that&#39;s fairly simple to do if that&#39;s what the design of the study and i think that that&#39;s really important um besides that i don&#39;t have many other comments except to say that like um i struggle a little bit with nexus studies sometimes because uh they&#39;re based on like what we would like to get out but not on what we miss out i think that nexus like linkage fees are fairly low that they don&#39;t actually inhibit commercial development in my opinion um so i&#39;m not really worried about it but it does make me um it does leave us in a tough place where we always do is like, what do we want out of development, but not like, what do we miss if it doesn&#39;t happen in terms of taxes or other sorts of stuff. So I just wanted to say that, but I think that, you know, linkage for all, you know, is fairly low cost in terms of all the development, especially for commercials. It&#39;s not the biggest deal in the world, but didn&#39;t want to mention that.</td>

My building of 100,000 square feet versus 300,000 square feet, why would there be any difference in terms of the need for affordable housing if it&#39;s straight up based on the number of low to moderate income workers who need housing?</td>

                <td>Mr. Carter? Thank you, through you, Vice Mayor Govan. So the next study, I think the way to think of it is establishing the determined rate that would be needed for that looking at a range of developments. And so we&#39;ll do that to determine that. And then some of the discussion that we would expect with with the study or would likely be around some of the policy trade-offs that would come within uh setting policy setting rates within that that upper limit so you think of the the existing provisions which allow for exemptions for projects that are under 60 000 square feet it&#39;s not to say that they don&#39;t have an impact but there was council made a choice to exempt a certain amount of floor area for those developments. And so within the upper limit that is established by the NEXA study, there are some policy trade-offs or considerations that the council could discuss. And I think what we want to do in the study is just build them in so that they&#39;re clear, so that we&#39;re giving some ability for the council to have that discussion at that point in time to understand if there are policy trade-offs that the council would like to consider to as with the marginal rate, so to not have a dead zone where there&#39;s a difference in payment, or to not have certain types of development that are more difficult to expect to see, given what the approach is. The other ones that we included in here, again, just to look at, not to say that this is what we expect the recommendation to be but we want the study to think about again looking at variation of rates by location we did that in the 2019 study we talked about that the council did not want to make that that choice but we think it&#39;s important it came up on the discussion and then also to look at variations in rate but potentially by use that would be probably more difficult and that might be more of a policy choice the council would have to make because if we look at the impact on the need for affordable housing and the funding that would be needed to create that affordable housing. Some of the uses are lower value uses, retail or restaurant compared to say office or lab. So if we establish the rate, the idea would be then we could look at ways in which the council could then have the discussion in setting the rate or setting the policy based upon that information from the study.</td>

                <td> I have a couple of questions if nobody else, other councilors know. So just, you know, I just want to point out that, you know, we just had a budget hearing and we talked a lot about how Kendall Square is struggling and how that impacts what we can do and what we can&#39;t do and residential tax rates and everything else. And so, you know, we do have to be mindful. when we add more and more fees to construction, the impact that that has. And I don&#39;t know if this would be relevant to this particular report, but I have mentioned this before and I think maybe it was a year or so ago that we did get a report from CDD about all the different things that we require for development and the costs of those. we tend to look at these things in isolation and we say okay we want to raise the linkage fee and because we want as much money as possible going to the affordable housing trust and i&#39;m on board with all of that but then you look at okay how does that fit with these 12 other things all good things themselves adding more and more and more cost. And I think, you know, clearly these developers have, you know, these folks who build these buildings and own these buildings have a whole lot more money than all of us in this room combined times, you know, 100. But their margins on some of these projects aren&#39;t actually, you know, as large as people think. People think they&#39;re making, you know, an 80% profit margin. That&#39;s not. how it actually works out. So everything that we do and every additional expense that we put on just sort of chips away at that and whether or not they&#39;re going to move forward or they&#39;re going to go to watertown at 11 bucks right and watertown&#39;s seeing quite a bit of of lab development there so um you know it is just it is always something we have to balance and keep in mind uh especially during these financial times um and then i would just say on the the types of workers you know i think when we think of someone who works in a lab we&#39;re thinking of someone who&#39;s making $200,000 a year or someone who works at Google or whatever, there&#39;s a lot of other jobs in those buildings and in those companies that aren&#39;t making that money. A lab technician, they might earn $60,000 to $70,000 a year. That is someone who&#39;s going to qualify for inclusionary. A security guard, somebody working on the custodial staff. I think sometimes when we talk about when we try to make the connection between housing and Kendall Square and these jobs, people think, oh, look at all these people working in these buildings are all making a ton of money and they&#39;re ruining the city and they&#39;re doing this. It&#39;s a lot of people who work in those jobs that aren&#39;t making that money, right? And those, you know, we wanna make sure that those people can stay here, you know, as well. So then I think that&#39;s where that link comes together. So, all right, if there&#39;s nothing further on a motion by Councilor Toner, to place the matter on file, roll call.</td>

                <td>Just wanted to make sure, because this is a really exciting plan. I really want to thank, I think, many people in addition to the ones at the table here before us, both Ms. Rasmussen and... traffic planner right is that your title now stephanie assistant commissioner for transportation planning okay it did the plan before us at cambridge zero emissions transportation plan is a first ever for the city and it represents a tremendous amount of work over i think the course of a year and a half or so of a task force that was set up specifically it started out as the Net zero transportation plan with the idea that we had a net zero action plan and that was really focused on buildings and we needed one for transportation. Even though it only represents 8% of our citywide emission pollution, it&#39;s a really critical part of so many of our goals for health and safety. The reason I&#39;m excited to have this move forward is that we&#39;ve, again, talked about it for a number of years. In the memo that I had wrote, which I did in conjunction with the staff and know about this, the zero emission transportation plan is the culmination of work of a task force of a broad range of people. What we did when we had the hearing on this plan, the draft plan on the Health and Environment Committee earlier this year in February, we reviewed an early draft of the plan. And as part of the meeting, what we did was talk about ways that we might think that it should be updated since this will basically become the policy document for the city. We want one place where everything is there for people to look at instead of looking at three different or many different items. What we did since that February 24th meeting was the staff work to incorporate smart goals in a number of areas because we know that if you have specific, measurable, actionable, relevant, and time-based goals, it&#39;s going to mean that we&#39;re going to know when we get there and also give us a sense of how we&#39;re doing. So I really appreciate the staff work on that. a number of smart goals which we can go over if we want but i think they&#39;re they&#39;re pretty important they track travel mode improvements to access to public transportation blue bikes metrics for car travel ev adoption and the targets will really allow for better oversight what i wanted to point out and what i hope that the council will approve which is in the memo that we all have had on the agenda since september 15th is that in addition to the goals and initiatives already in the document, the city council itself has discussed some of this over the past year since the task force finished its work. So in order to have a complete and comprehensive plan, it makes sense, I think, to include a couple of the council goals which include the citywide shuttle and transit gap study and to include all of our work that we&#39;ve been doing as a council on expanding fare free programs or really have that be part of the plan and the hope for in this document. And then there&#39;s a second one on improving safety and access for micro mobility modes has also been an important transportation initiative of this council. The staff has worked with the state commission on this. The idea would be, and I would love to know, I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s the solicitor or the staff, I would love to pass the plan tonight except to say it&#39;s with the proviso of incorporating those elements that the council has in a future document. I&#39;m not sure if it has to come back to the council. I would trust the staff to incorporate those. And if there&#39;s any other initiatives that this council wants to include, now&#39;s the time. But I think those are two of the ones that are really important for this council for us to make sure that are in the final policy document.</td>

You&#39;ve engaged a very diverse group, but it seems like to me as though it would make sense to engage neighbors that are impacted by congestion as well, like I&#39;m thinking about on Putnam Avenue, Granite Street, North Mass Ave. It seems like they should be part of planning for the transportation plan as well because We hear from them all the time and I&#39;m sure you do too. So it seems like engaging residents from around the community that are impacted by congestion and curb congestion would be a good idea. Anyway, I thought you had so many good ideas. I&#39;m hoping that the city&#39;s Safe Routes to School program is in all of our schools. I don&#39;t know if it is or not, but I thought you had great ideas for reducing car ownership, and I wish we could encourage universities to discourage students from bringing cars. I know we can&#39;t tell them not to bring cars, but it seems like we could encourage them and say that this is a pretty much car-free city, or we&#39;re trying to become a car-free city. I wish we could reduce parking permits to one per person or two per household. And I wish we could encourage more car shares and rentals and neighborhoods for weekend getaways, because that would really reduce the need for cars. And as I&#39;ve been meeting with neighbors, I was meeting with neighbors at... They were really concerned with a lot of people are buying micro mobility devices, which is great, but other neighbors are really freaked out by having the devices with lithium batteries in their buildings because they feel like they&#39;re a fire issue. So maybe there would be some way that we can extend the plan also or augment the plan to consider creating or incentivizing apartment buildings to create safe storage facilities outside for those micro mobility devices. Anyway, I think it&#39;s great all that you&#39;re doing to make Cambridge greater for cycling. And I was just looking at, again, numbers in Montreal, a place I hope to get this summer, but I never got there. But in Montreal, apparently 50% of the population cycles at some point, and over 13% are regularly using the bike for transport needs. And it&#39;s a lot colder in Montreal than it is here. So I realize that that&#39;s where you&#39;re hoping that we&#39;re going to go, that over time as we make cycling even safer, and easier to do that more and more people will be cycling. Someone had mentioned to me that we need to make our buses cleaner and to feel more safe, because they were saying when they&#39;d ridden the bus recently, there were people on the bus that were a little crazy, and they felt very unsafe on the bus, so... Anyway, maybe that would help us with encouraging people to use the bus. And then finally, I just wanted to say that I&#39;m really looking forward to your Cambridge Access and Mobility Plan, that coming soon. Anyway, I just want you to remember cars. One of the things I learned from your report on page 46 was that there actually, I thought there were 42,000 cars. registered or permitted vehicles in the city. But actually, it sounds like since 21, 23, we have over 44,000, almost 400 permitted vehicles. So we really need to figure out how to accommodate them, at least until I was at the mobility lecture at MIT on Friday. They&#39;re saying autonomous vehicles, shared autonomous vehicles are the future. When they come to inhabit Cambridge, there&#39;ll be much less congestion on our roads and on our curbs. So I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s the real future or not, but I hope so, if it&#39;ll help ease congestion both places. Anyway, I thank you so much for your work, and I think this is a great plan for the future. I thank you.</td>

Because oftentimes, we talk about, well, in that Envision Zero plan, We want to do X, Y, and Z, but never thought about what the cost was to actually implement the plan. So I just feel like it&#39;s a little bit backwards to adopt a plan without being mindful of what the cost is going to be. So I just really want to name that and think about that as we move forward because again, These costs for everything that we do, especially as we just had earlier in this conversation, a big talk about what we cannot do and how we need to be mindful financially. And again, these are great ideas, but these ideas will come to dollars. And so... I&#39;m happy to pause that, but I just want us to be really mindful of it.</td>

These are things that are already in sort of the planning framework and things that the Department of Transportation in particular is working on. So we can try to pull those out in terms of their costs, but these are things that are sort of in the planning framework. within the planning field anyway, but we&#39;re certainly happy to bring back for the adoption phase some more thoughts about what it might look like over the longer term.</td>

Through you, Vice Mayor. think that it&#39;s just important right we have to be able to have that transparency like everybody talks about how we have transparency at the table and to adopt a plan without actual numbers is not being transparent in my opinion and I think it gives me a little bit of reservation because again I think there are a lot of things that we are able to do really great but then What does that mean when we can&#39;t, I don&#39;t know, keep a shelter open or give families $500 a month, but yet we want to identify what zero emissions transportation plan looks like and making sure that we fund that, but not knowing what the dollar is to fund it. So I just want us to be very... intentional with how we move forward in our planning. And I think as we come up with SMART goals and all the steps and levels of SMART goals, when we&#39;re trying to be specific, specifically, it&#39;s also thinking about dollar-wise. What does it mean to get to that place? So I appreciate what has been shared here. I also appreciate the folks who are on the board, the advisory board, a lot of these names I know and a lot of people who I trust in the community to really be a representative of even me, my voice, my thoughts, and members of the community who we all represent but who I think I really personally represent. So I appreciate seeing their voices here. And I really do look forward to how we continue to have these conversations across the board. And I just, yeah, so I feel like I had to name that and I appreciate the opportunity to do so. One additional thing that I have in terms of a conversation is, and I think this goes back to the community engagement piece, is Specifically, how are you all using the voices of the people who are at the table, but in the greater sense of the community? So what does that look like on the ground for your community engagement?</td>

So before we even got to the goals of the plan, we came to them with the initial idea that we need to eliminate transportation emissions and through conversations with them and relationship building we added three other goals to the plan to make sure that it really represented what people need in their lives excuse me and we We had large community meetings at the senior center and online. We made sure that we worked with the community engagement team from the very start to make sure that we were engaging communities that are often underheard and underrepresented. and historically excluded. We worked with the Office of Language Justice to make sure that we had good available interpretation at our meetings when it was needed, and we translated all of our materials to make sure that we could reach different language justice communities in Cambridge.</td>

A walkable city, recognizing that there are people who do drive cars and need to drive cars, as well as there are 2,000 plus employees that are coming into our city or just moving around our city and just being mindful of how they need to move around and what they need and how can they do that in the most efficient way possible while we are still trying to work towards the goals that we have set forth. So thank you, I yield.</td>

And so this is just... the council saying to the city manager this is an important issue to families please look at it come back with a plan of action but also let parents know families know what we&#39;re doing so i don&#39;t want to make this a long discussion it&#39;s very simple the the policy order is self-explanatory We&#39;re asking the city to do their due diligence in making sure that our park is safe and our parks are safe. I did talk to the city manager and the deputy city manager, and they said they have already done some work on this. So we&#39;ll probably hear about Gold Star Mothers Park first, and then they will follow up with looking at other parks in the city. I yield.</td>

So we want to ensure that our spaces are safe. and that we are doing the necessary testing and cleaning and just making sure that these are definitely spaces where, you know, if there are any notifications around contaminations, that we act really fast and urgently in order to, you know, shut down a park and remedy any of those spaces that we need to. You know, again, as a mother of a young child, I frequent a lot of parks throughout our city, and, you know, it&#39;s... A lot of this stuff often gives me a lot of pause and reservation about where I go and what does that look like and mean, because I want to make sure that we&#39;re in safe spaces. But I don&#39;t think you don&#39;t know what you don&#39;t know until you learn, and that could possibly be too late. So I just want to make sure that we&#39;re acting where urgency, and I do believe that this speaks to that. So not only for Gold Star Mother&#39;s Park, but just other parks across our city.</td>

The next step will be to meet with institutional partners and neighborhood leaders to craft new protections for our residential neighborhoods. We do want universities to be able to build housing for their students while not encroaching on neighborhoods and in displacing residents. But fences make good neighbors. So anyway, it&#39;s great to proceed with the first thing, which is to align ourselves with state law and then to proceed with conversations with our institutional partners. and neighborhoods to figure out how we can best protect, regulate institutional use to protect neighborhoods while encouraging universities to produce housing going forward.

And, you know, the same regulations that we put MIT and Harvard to are the same regulations we hold our daycares accountable for.

And to clarify that the city manager would have to work with a range of property owners because we don&#39;t own much of the land in there and yet this is a coordinated effort. I know the staff has seen this and is willing to do what they can. and the report back while it will be to the city council and hear someone from the community ask wait aren&#39;t they going to talk to the community it&#39;s just that that&#39;s the way the city manager reports back just to clarify to the community that obviously that report will also be in conjunction with all the folks in the community so i want to to clarify that to um so people can know thanks that&#39;s all Thank you.</td>

I was just very impressed in taking a walk back there with folks from the LA study group and them commenting on how many things IQHQ has tried to do as well as the city and dealing with some of the issues. So they&#39;ve really been a great partner. And if, I mean, I grew up there, up on the fence behind WR Grace and going through the parking lot. And I just have to say, when I walk down there now and it&#39;s all wide open with, even though it&#39;s still a parking lot, it&#39;s got solar and there&#39;s actually a lot of new trees and greenery planted. And it just looks like a whole different neighborhood now back at the end of linear park. So I think it&#39;s, I know the park&#39;s gonna be under construction for a year and a half, but I just think that one aspect of it really has brought a change to the neighborhood. So I want to thank them, thank the neighbors, and hopefully we as a city can help provide supports and do what we can to address the needs of the unhoused in that area and try to end the, just tossing the needles and things back there, and really just address the safety concerns people have. Thank you, I yield.</td>

I was kind of jealous. I was like, How come I didn&#39;t get an invitation? But next time, right? Okay, thank you. So, you know, I think there&#39;s a lot of work to do, and especially when we&#39;re talking about a space that is like a shared space in terms of who owns what part of the space, we really need to be working diligently with all the partners and all the stakeholders to, you know, especially during the closure of Linnian Park, to make sure that we... add more lighting to the walkway that is really considered like the scary walkway right now to make it less scary and to make sure that folks can feel safe and be okay. Also to identify more social services that we can be offering to individuals who are unhoused, who need additional supports and obviously services that are just not nine to five or seven to seven. um and and also carry on to the weekend there&#39;s just such a great need and and I feel like that&#39;s probably where the city can be doing a little bit more work so maybe that&#39;s an additional policy order to come through but there you know I appreciate kind of where we are in the work and recognize that We&#39;re not alone in trying to accomplish the various things but just really wanted to lift up that IQ HQ is is really a strong partner and you know anything that the city can do to help with You know navigating like I said the lighting to additional social services and supports and to whatever else we could actually do would be great to the neighbors, to visitors in that neighborhood, to the young people who go to the parks, the fields. It&#39;s football season, it&#39;s play season, it&#39;s baseball season. We have a number of different people that are coming in and throughout Russell Field and in the various parks around there, as well as a bunch of visitors that, you know, come in and out of our city. So whatever we can do and whatever we can do proactively, I would love to see that. Thank you.</td>

So I hope that will be considered to us part of this, and I would like to be added to this policy order. Thank you.</td>

I know there&#39;s a lot of concern that DPW is not paying attention there, but they are. But it&#39;s an ongoing battle. But I don&#39;t want people to think that that DPW is ignoring that.

And there&#39;s been a lot of discussion in the community about, given the geographic location also, that there&#39;s a number of people who live in the area who, while they could come to West Cambridge, to the Senior Center here and others, in the spirit of geographic equity, to see if there&#39;s a way that we could work with the city to provide some way for that space. It&#39;s an incredibly beautiful space that we paid for and that is empty most of the day except for in the summer. It&#39;s just used full time in the summer by youth programs and in the afternoons and evenings, but during the day it&#39;s very little used. And we recognize there are some challenges. I know the city staff is aware of this and we&#39;ve talked to it and now is the time to say, okay, the full council is behind this, hopefully.</td>

And when I was there during that time, whether it&#39;s with our teen program or really thinking a little more outside the box of what more can we be adding to the space, from cooking classes to other youth serving things, but definitely senior programs and recognizing there&#39;s a senior center here. There&#39;s also one in North Cambridge, but I think those who are living in West Cambridge do have a disadvantage, not only for public transportation, but even if you&#39;re driving across the city, could be really challenging. I also want to name that our Cambridge program that houses our special, that provides services and opportunities for our, excuse me, adults who have special learning needs do offer a lot of services and programs. and meet there every single Saturday. So while there are a lot of things that are happening out of the center, I recognize that there&#39;s a little bit of an inequity, and if we can fill it and find other ways to be more productive in service of others in our community, that we should. So with that, I again want to be at it, and I yield. Thank you.</td>

Mitchell Jr. felt very cared for by the entire city council. Last Wednesday, we laid him to rest with a very beautiful Masonic funeral, which took about a little over an hour. And then, of course, a Christian burial. His family came here to participate in his being laid to rest. As many of you know, or maybe not know, that Mr. Mitchell was a pretty incredible man. He spoke German and Polish, served in World War II as a medic, went to Duquesne, came to Harvard not to go to school, but to play against Harvard because he went to Duquesne. And that&#39;s just a little bit of what he did. He worked for one of the largest insurance companies. companies that was totally black owned and operated as the vice president. There&#39;s so many things that this man had accomplished. And then he decided to settle in Cambridge and his remaining years love the city like it was owned. And I remember him saying to me, you know, Cambridge is my home. I want to be buried here. And we made his wishes come true and respectfully laid him to rest last Wednesday. He thought very highly of the entire city council. And I have to especially thank two individuals. One is Sean Hope, who brought him home when he was out there talking about Prince Hall. And if he didn&#39;t tell you about Prince Hall, then I don&#39;t know. He was not special enough, I guess. And to you, Vice Mayor, who interrupted him trying to buy something from some guy in the corner of the street. But you said, hey, Mr. Mitchell&#39;s out here and he&#39;s getting ready to take this purchase. And you put him in your car and you brought him over to where I was. I don&#39;t think... a man could be any more known and supported than he was. But I can also not know of a man who has done as much as he has. One of the things that he was most proud of is the Prince Hall Memorial that sits on the common. And so I just want to say thank you to my colleagues who participated in taking care of him and making him part of our city council family. His family is very grateful. I would hope that, I&#39;m not going to hope, I know that you&#39;ll support this policy resolution that&#39;s going to go to his family and to the Prince Hall Lodge, marking not his death, but his living. And so thank you so, so very much as we lift up a prominent and important man. I yield the floor.</td>

And then, I don&#39;t know, maybe he wasn&#39;t that special enough to enjoy and be indulged with his knowledge and just his care and sensitivity to the topic, but also his urgency around wanting to make sure that folks were educated around Prince Hall and just always sharing a small packet and saying, next time I see you, I&#39;m going to quiz you. And that was just always a thing, and that was something that we had which I truly appreciate. And just, again, he will be so, so missed because of just his warmth and just his, I don&#39;t know, he just always had a coolness to him, just a very chill, cool type of guy and would just always remember a face. So that&#39;s something that I&#39;ll miss, just going to church on Sunday and having him be there. It&#39;s just always been a treat, and even for my son to see him and meet him and all that. So thank you, thank you, Madam Mayor, for even sharing him with us in the community as well. And again, my deepest condolences to him, his family, to you, and to our community. Thank you.</td>

                <td>I would like to withdraw my amendment, or my amendment by substitution, though I do think it is, I always think it&#39;s good to have data to inform zoning policy and any city policy. So what I had hoped with my amendment was to ask for more specifics because I was concerned that the ex, that the consultant was basing his or her recommendations around relating to the height of the average solar installation. I was concerned that it was the wrong x, but I think I&#39;ve been convinced by colleagues that maybe it would be best to advance the recommendations of CDD as proposed, and if we want to explore what a better X might be later that we can, but I think it&#39;s very important that our policy is always based on data. And I think it is important that we protect our solar installations, especially because the city was encouraging the solar installations. Remember there was sunny Cambridge, And we were all encouraged to add solar installations, which was in part what inspired us to add solar panels to our house. So I feel as though the city has some responsibility to help to to protect these installations. And also they do provide, I was told they may provide as much as 10 gigawatt hours of electricity, which would be enough electricity to power Beth Israel Hospital or a small university. So it&#39;s not like they&#39;re not contributing nothing to our net zero action plan. They&#39;re actually contributing to our goals to reduce carbon emissions for the city. So for that reason, I think it&#39;s really important that we proceed with CDD&#39;s recommendations. to um to look into drafting language um i know cdd will also be talking with more developers who we we heard from some of them tonight but i think we need to have a broader view and then chair mcgovern i know you were concerned um you wanted aho construction to be exempt from the proposed zoning so i think that should be considered too but i i i think we&#39;ve got to protect our OUR SOLAR INSTALLATIONS, ESPECIALLY SINCE WE, THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE, ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO INVEST IN THEM.

                <td>I YIELD. Yeah, I&#39;m always in favor of data, but I did feel like that might slow this down, and the staff did a really good job of extensive analysis with 45 and 40 and 30, and I felt like we could probably extrapolate fairly quickly to 25. JUST TO REMIND US ALL OF THE CONTEXT OF THIS, SINCE I DIDN&#39;T GET TO SAY IT LAST WEEK, THE POLICY ORDER CAME OUT OF THE HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENT COMMITTEE MEETING AND IT WAS BASED ON A REPORT BY CDD ON SOMETHING THAT THIS COUNCIL HAD DISCUSSED I THINK STARTING LAST NOVEMBER WHEN IT FIRST CAME UP AND THERE WAS A CITY SOLICITOR MEMO ABOUT If you do want to protect solar, you have to file a new petition. So we decided not to incorporate a thanks. We didn&#39;t want to slow the multifamily zoning down. And then again, in February and March, the council as a whole said, yes, we do want to follow this up. First, we want to pass the zoning. But to remind us all that the reason the staff spent months and months on an extensive analysis is because we asked them to because we thought these twin goals are really important. We don&#39;t want to slow down housing production, but we do want to see if there&#39;s a way to protect solar. And I want to say first, an important point, and I&#39;ve checked with, and ACM Peters can confirm this, the intent was to have any change apply only to parcels wholly in C1. I know someone called me and said, well, what about a big development of 12 stories on a quarter? If it&#39;s not on a C1 fully enclosed parcel, then I think the intent of this, and it can be confirmed, was that this would not apply then if there was a change. So at that meeting in September, this motion was voted unanimously by all five members and supported by two counselors, Vice Member McGovern and Counselor Zusy, who weren&#39;t on the committee. The reason only Counselor Azeem and my name is on it is because we can&#39;t have all five members on a policy order. So it&#39;s specifically also to address some questions, ask the staff, work with developers before finalizing any zoning language. The intent would be that before drafting formal language, any findings would be incorporated into recommendations. It may be we need to specify that or make that clear in this policy order if it&#39;s a will of the body to do that. And it may also be that working with developers, there could be other options that are possible. There may be some urban design principles that the staff or the analysis didn&#39;t think of. And those recommendations that were outlined by CDD were some stepbacks above a certain height, only on the north side of residential buildings. Again, this would also only apply to one-third of the parcels in the city, because they have to be over 5,000 square feet. And I would expect CDD to meet with developers to confirm the feasibility and any impact findings, and as well to include an exemption for any 100% affordable housing projects. The analysis did suggest that square footage be reduced only by 3 to 6% in a project to protect a large share, not all of solar projection. If it turns out on further analysis, it&#39;s far above that threshold, it would compromise 15 to 20% of the total project. I understand that might not be a tradeoff we&#39;d be willing to make, but it seems that making that sweet spot of a balance of a small reduction in the net square footage in exchange for protecting a large percentage of solar access strikes me as a good compromise. And to remind us, the recommendations were developed through an analysis of solar radiation of taller buildings on lower heights on other buildings. This approach is one the staff has been working on for a month, so I hope we can at least move it forward to the next step to say, meet with developers, see if it&#39;s actually feasible, and if so, let&#39;s move forward with zoning. So that&#39;s what I hope we do tonight. I&#39;m not sure if ACM Peters wants to add anything to that or correct anything I said.</td>

So I would rather we make a decision tonight whether we want to pursue this or not. because we&#39;re creating a lot of uncertainty out there in the community, both for the people who have solar, but also people who are trying to move forward with projects. And I basically get the sense, I may be wrong, but a month from now, after people do a lot of work and a lot of research, people are going to end up voting not to make changes to begin with.

But through you, if I can ask to ACM Peters, if by sending it to that, functionally be able to do what the intent of the policy order was to begin with, which is to say meet with developers, talk about feasibility, find other ideas for if the step back is feasible, and if not, if there&#39;s some other ideas.

You know, I&#39;ve said all along that I support solar. My votes prove that. My record proves that. But I am concerned about You know, there&#39;s a difference between protecting folks who have solar already, right, and you invest all this money and then, you know, maybe something gets built next to you and it causes a problem versus sort of indefinitely where someone could put solar on their house and then, you know, get a six-story building there, right? And that could be a potential problem. And I do worry about the inclusion area. Pretty much the majority of us have all said publicly, you know, that we have reservations about lowering inclusionary to 10%, but we could take a step tonight that might lower it to 0% if people don&#39;t build six-story buildings because the stepbacks, and we have to say stepbacks, not setbacks. We use those interchangeably, which is so, you know, the stepbacks make it financially, you know... It&#39;s not possible to do so there definitely needs to be more conversation I and I know some people I mentioned one of the last meetings about sitting down with developers and I got a few emails from folks saying why would you want to talk to developer developers build stuff. Right and so CDD they run the numbers they look at you know when the sun is coming this way on this part you get this kind of shadow but. CDD is not building things. They&#39;re not going through the performance. They&#39;re not looking at the cost. They&#39;re not the ones who can actually sit there and say, geez, this is what the cost of construction products are now, and if you do this. So we have to sit down and talk to builders, because they&#39;re the ones doing that work. It makes sense. So if there&#39;s no further... Oh, Councilor Zusy.</td>

                <td> Thank you, Chair McGovern. I just wanted to say I think we have to have a balanced view. So we do want to build housing. I think actually we&#39;re all in agreement there. I think some of us want most of the housing or a lot of the housing to be in the areas envisioned Cambridge recommended. So along the corridors, in the squares, and in transition districts. But we also want to, we have sustainability goals for the city. So the protection of solar is part of that. And then, you know, we&#39;ve got an active tree ordinance and we want to protect our trees. And I know just in the last weeks, I&#39;ve been receiving emails. I think we all have about like there is this big, they&#39;re big, mature. There&#39;s a big oak tree at 48 Garden Street that is about to be decimated. And then there are all these other mature trees. And again, we love our trees, right? That&#39;s why we have this tree ordinance ordinance. at 9 Wyman Street, where we&#39;re about to lose a bunch of trees. So I think we really want to have, it&#39;s really important to consider balance. And we don&#39;t want to give up sort of what makes Cambridge so special. I mean, there are many, many things that make Cambridge so special. But again, there are ways that we can be adding housing. without cutting down all our big beautiful mature trees or shading solar installations that are producing green energy and reducing our fossil emissions. So I think all of these things are important and I think we can figure out how we can move forward housing, protect our trees, and protect our existing solar. Thank you. I yield.</td>

But if you have to make a choice... between the number of units versus solar, or the number of units versus trees, then it becomes more complicated, and that&#39;s the hard part. And then you see what are the priorities that different people have, and how they put those priorities in front of other things. That&#39;s the hard part. But I&#39;m not getting off on that tangent. an amendment in front of us to send this to Housing and Environment. Health and Environment. If there&#39;s no further conversation on that, on the amendment.</td>

I&#39;m really clear that we should be protecting as much solar as we can. It is a part of our official city policy. It is in our net zero action plan that we are creating solar, and it is something that mitigates the peak effect of any kind of electrical power a need in Summers with addressing the need for us to address the peak. It&#39;s, I know, but it&#39;s really important to make that, this is about whether I would vote for this final now.</td>

I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything else on the table. We took care of number six. Communications, we took care of. Resolutions, we took care of. We have a committee report. An ordinance has been received from the interim city clerk, Paula Crane, relative to the dangerous dog ordinance. We just need to place on file, yeah? Committee report number one. Accept the report and place on file. I don&#39;t think we need to discuss it. Roll call. Councilor Azeem.</td>
