I am here once again to support strengthening the welcoming community ordinance, specifically the most recent language in the agenda packet. As I&#39;ve said previously, it&#39;s crucial that our local law enforcement neither help nor be perceived as helping ICE, whether through crowd control, police escort, or anything else. I also reiterate my thanks to CPD leadership, the city solicitor, and members of the council for your collaboration and support. Since addressing you all at the ordinance committee meeting last week, I took a cursory look at a 2023 report from Northeastern Law School analyzing welcoming city ordinances in Massachusetts and concluded that, were this language to pass, Cambridge would have the strongest ordinance of its kind in the entire Commonwealth. I&#39;m so proud to live in a city that it&#39;s a leader on so many issues, and I urge the council to adopt this language. Thank you.</td>

I am here to support the most recent language amending the Welcoming City Ordinance. I will be brief since most of you heard me at the Ordinance Committee. I agree with everything Julia just said. I am very happy with the language proposed most recently by the City Solicitor and Superintendent Wells and others in the administration for listening to our concerns and responding with language that successfully addresses these difficult issues. Also want to thank counselors, Sobrinho-Wheeler, Nolan, and Siddiqui and others for bringing this important issue forward. This language draws a bright line against cooperation or assistance by city employees by removing existing ordinance language that allowed police to assist ICE with crowd control and police escort. And it directs police command staff to take reasonable steps to ensure that ICE agents are who they say they are. So I strongly support this language and I want to be recorded as opposing any other amendments that might require our police to engage with ICE in ways that will inevitably be counterproductive. So we will ordain this language this evening. Thank you.</td>

First, I want to gently correct an important point. The garden mentioned in the order is not solely owned by the neighboring condos. It&#39;s a limited common element of the condo association, which is 50% St. James, and under the church&#39;s exclusive use and care. This sounds technical, but it&#39;s important, especially as we approach mediation and good faith with our neighbors. For many years, our church has welcomed unhoused individuals to sleep on our porches. This practice is grounded in our faith and our call to extend hospitality and care. We recognize that this arrangement can cause concern for others. That&#39;s why members of our community regularly come in the mornings to clean up, build relationships, and reduce any impacts on the surrounding areas. We have worked with city partners like First Step, the CARES team, and sometimes the Cambridge Police to respond thoughtfully. We&#39;ve also been in dialogue with our neighbors, and we are preparing for mediation this September with a sincere desire to find a shared path forward. Given all that, we were disappointed that the policy order was introduced without input from the church. It was shared with our rector just a day before it was finalized, and despite his suggested edits, the order proceeded as written. That felt discouraging, not because we opposed collaboration, but because we&#39;ve been trying hard to be a part of the solution and weren&#39;t given an opportunity to contribute. We believe any lasting approach to this issue needs to be developed in partnership with respect for the complex needs involved and with care for both housed and unhoused neighbors. We remain hopeful for a collaborative way forward that reflects the values we all share as members of this city. Thank you.</td>

I&#39;ve already written an email in about PO3, which I hope you have read, detailing the issues around the description of the ownership of the garden and the introduction before mediation is started. Tonight, though, I want to give voice to the people who were also left out of the conversations when this PO was drafted, the people who sleep rough on our porches. They regularly say thank you and talk about how our porches are a safe and sacred space. People share how different they feel on our porches and when parishioners stop by to check in and wake them up in the morning. Elsewhere, they either feel unseen or chased away. But in our space, they feel safe and supported. They tell me they know that the people who can afford expensive homes in Cambridge often look down on them and want them to go away. When one woman was angry with me over a boundary I set, she said, I know you think I am trash. I knew she didn&#39;t truly think I felt that way, but rather that was the message she hears day in and day out from others. They know their lives are seen as less valuable than others. People like Tommy, who faithfully took care of other unhoused folks on our porches and always cleaned up his stuff and things others left behind. I used to call him and his buddy Kevin the captains of our crew. Our perches were their safe space and they made sure to take care of them and everyone who found their way to us. I saw Tommy yesterday and he shared that he had a bed in a small shelter and is so happy. I&#39;m so glad our portraits provided him a safe space to be until he was able to enter the shelter. Or Chelsea who told me one morning she was heading to a rehab bed but didn&#39;t go. Two days later I saw her again and I checked in and she said she didn&#39;t make it but she really wanted to go. As we were eating breakfast, waiting for it to be late enough to head for her clinic, she said, you aren&#39;t going to leave my side until I checked in, huh? And I smiled. I haven&#39;t seen her since I left her at the clinic after she told them she was ready for rehab. So I hope she is still in rehab or done and home with her family. These are just two people who slept on our porches and for whom I know the space made a real difference.</td>

I&#39;m the managing director of the Multicultural Arts Center, a nonprofit located in East Cambridge on 2nd Street for over 45 years, and I&#39;m also a Cambridge resident, and I&#39;m speaking today on behalf of the Nonprofit Coalition Sector Strategy Committee to advocate for an improved process for funding nonprofits through zoning mitigation, and in particular through the Community Benefits Fund. This Community Benefits Fund that was held for this petition, the process, excuse me, that was held for this petition did not reach the necessary residents nor the nonprofit leaders of East Cambridge, let alone the wider Cambridge network, many of whom are directly impacted by the development in East Cambridge and Kendall Square. The Community Benefits Fund is the one vehicle designed to support nonprofits in Cambridge, and I believe it was set up to fail by not having a clear expectation of when and how funds would be allocated, and by not making it a clear option or even a requirement in all discussions with developers regarding upzoning. The city puts so much responsibility on the nonprofit sector to deliver on the goals the city has articulated. And if not through this vehicle, then how is the city going to make sure that the nonprofits it depends on will survive the changing funding landscape and the changing landscape of real estate and the cost of living? I&#39;m glad that a compromise has been reached, and I want to thank the counselors who advocated on behalf of a portion going to the Community Benefits Fund, Counselors Wilson, McGovern, Siddiqui, and Simmons. And I want to stress the importance of having an improved process squarely in place before the next development petition comes up for debate.</td>

                <td>Please go ahead. Yes. Hi. My name is Dan Totten. I live at 54 Bishop Allen Drive. I want to quickly mention my support for the further amendments to the Welcoming Community Ordinance. that are apparently going to be introduced tonight, and also the community benefits compromise. I stand in solidarity with the Community Arts Center, the Cambridge Community Center, and the other nonprofits that are asking for a bigger share of the pie. But I do want to focus on the policy order number three, which seems to target a specific group of outside sleepers, and it asks for additional enforcement tools that could target outside sleepers across the city. I have really deep concerns about this. particularly because it&#39;s coming just one week after President Trump issued an executive order that criminalizes homelessness to a degree that we have never seen in this country before it&#39;s really scary when you read that order and you think about what he&#39;s saying and then to see this order this policy order on our local agenda one week later which mirrors that executive order, it&#39;s really concerning. It&#39;s also concerning that this comes just one month after the closure of a 58-bed homeless shelter. It&#39;s so hypocritical to take away shelter options and then criminalize outside sleepers. Where do we expect them to go? So, Mayor Simmons, I assume that you had really good intent in submitting this. I know that there are people on both sides of the issue, but I think given the executive order last week, this really needs some more thought. I would also contend that maybe if there&#39;s an ongoing mediation process that the city council putting their thumb on the scale in this moment could actually undermine that mediation process and make it more difficult for the church and the condo owners to reach an agreement. So for those reasons, I would respectfully ask you to either vote it down or exercise a charter right so that we have a month to work on it. And please add heart to consideration of alternatives to the police that should be contacted in a situation like this. Thank you.</td>

I am the president of the board of Central Square Theatre. CST explores social justice, science, and gender politics through theater. Combining artistic excellence, cross-disciplinary collaboration, and community engagement, we create theater where diverse points of view are heard, perspectives shift, and change can happen. Through our programs and partnerships, we serve communities across Cambridge, including East Cambridge. We find the Cambridge Nonprofit Coalition to be a valuable partner and advocate for the sector. The allocation of $3.2 million to the Community Benefits Fund from the BioMed settlement is welcome and essential to the ongoing sustainability of the city&#39;s nonprofit sector. CST and other organizations benefited enormously from COVID relief funding from the CBF. Rather than distributing funds through one-off signed deals, the Community Benefit Fund has engaged in a transparent and equitable practice. With the fund down down to $1.6 million, It&#39;s essential to bolster its funding. The city&#39;s nonprofits are facing a new set of fiscal challenges, just as we&#39;ve begun to recover from the pandemic. Thank you, Vice Mayor McGovern, Councilor Wilson, Councilor Siddiqui, and Mayor Simmons for your efforts to arrive at the compromise that&#39;s before the council this evening. I understand that the Cambridge Nonprofit Coalition has approached the council about creating a more clear and open process for allocating similar zoning mitigation agreements in the future, and we at Central Square Theatre welcome that. A transparent process that includes the leadership of all of the city&#39;s nonprofits will benefit all of us. As a nonprofit leader, I know how vital it is to have access to clear, inclusive funding opportunities like the Community Benefits Fund. which not only offers critical financial support, but sets a standard for equitable, transparent, and collaborative decision making. Thank you.</td>

We represent almost 100 Cambridge-serving nonprofits that provide services and programs ranging from affordable housing to youth development to early childhood to environmental preservation, legal services, arts and culture, and much, much more. I&#39;m here on behalf of the coalition to share our support for the compromise in the Biomed Realty East Cambridge Community Enhancement Petition that will allocate $3.2 million to the Community Benefits Fund. Even though it&#39;s clear that both Cambridge nonprofits and residents are facing rapidly increasing challenges that require further resources, this allocation to the Community Benefits Fund is a critical and appreciated investment. It is a contribution to a centralized, transparent, and equitable fund that will positively impact many nonprofits across the city and the people they serve. It is especially vital to make an investment in the Community Benefits Fund now. During the pandemic, the Community Benefits Fund provided $2 million in COVID relief grants that help nonprofits navigate severe financial challenges. Today, many organizations are again facing the same instability and increased demand for services. The fund currently has only $1.6 million available now, so every additional dollar that can be put toward the Community Benefits Fund is needed to help ensure that nonprofits throughout Cambridge remain strong, resilient, and able to serve our communities effectively. We are deeply grateful for the advocacy of Vice Mayor Mark McGovern, Councilor Ayesha Wilson, Councilor Sambal Siddiqui, and Mayor Denise Simmons, who invested countless, countless hours on behalf to negotiate this compromise. CNC looks forward to working together to change the processes surrounding zoning mitigation agreements in the near future in ways that make them more clear, more open, more equitable, and prevent similar situations from happening again.

                <td> Thank you. Suzanne Blier, by Fuller Place, and I&#39;m wishing you all well for this summer meeting. Thank you. The clearly transparency and well-constructed process and well-known process is on the table in the previous comments and some of the issues here, and I would just endorse that more generally. But I&#39;m here to speak specifically to three other things. First, a celebration of of all of the affordable housing that is now being built and is in the packet that was presented for this particular meeting. I think it&#39;s important to celebrate that news and also including one of the new ones, a preserved parish structure in East Cambridge. And that speaks in part to how preservation and community input is really doing very positive things. And that currently, I guess, we&#39;re purchasing land for more housing when other funding becomes available for this. So I&#39;m on the real celebration side on that. On the question, there&#39;s an upzoning petition about allowing larger, taller buildings for religious use, a zoning case. As you probably know, historically today, there&#39;s so many religions in Cambridge from around the world and not just here, that I hope you will not approve this. I worry that providing special compensation to build bigger structures would potentially hurt both our commercial base, taking away potentially critical commercial sites, and our goals for housing structures and green space. And finally, I&#39;m a signatory to the zoning petition bearing Martin Bacall&#39;s name. I think it&#39;s a really, really terrific one. And it would provide a means to get more green spaces as we&#39;re building higher and bigger by putting certain restrictions on pavements. And I really urge you to support it. I think that&#39;s a win-win too. Thank you.</td>

                <td> Thank you. My name is Steven Bardage. I&#39;ve lived in Cambridge for 53 years. I&#39;ve lived in 7 Beach Street for two and a half years. I&#39;d like to thank the mayor&#39;s office for initiating this policy order and we really appreciate it. the efforts that they&#39;ve put into that. You, the members of the council, have received numerous personal, very articulate emails from the residents of St. James Place, from the businesses that surround it, from former residents of St. James Place that repeat the issues that were faced day in and day out. I won&#39;t repeat those at this time. But I would like to address Councilor Nolan&#39;s response, and I really appreciate the fact that she sent us a response detailing her thinking. And I agree with much of what she said, but we urge you in the strongest terms not to delay. We really need immediate intervention, particularly in the garden area. As to mediation, I think there&#39;s some confusion. Mediation is scheduled for September 5th, 2025. It exclusively involves the porches. It does not address the garden area and the activities that take place there. The residents and the churches agree that no one should be in the garden area after dusk, period. The church is responsible for enforcing these rules that were established prior to the construction of the condominiums, in agreement with the city, the developer, and the church. But there is no enforcement. By my best estimates, the police and the EMTs have been to the garden area about a dozen times in the last month. There have been at least two arrests. The residents in the church have talked about the use of its porches for two years. Pursuant to the condo documents, the church and the residents agreed, because we had an impasse, to submit the dispute to mediation. The mediation does not address the broader issues of homelessness, drug and mental health problems. It does not address the garden area.</td>

First, I want to thank Mayor Simmons, Vice Mayor McGovern, Councilors Siddiqui and Wilson for working towards having some of the funds from this project go to the Community Benefits Fund. As I stated last month when I&#39;m at the meeting, I&#39;ve been impressed over my career at De Novo on the way the City of Cambridge has been how they&#39;ve implemented programs that have been innovative and really helped improve the quality of life for its residents. One example of these programs would be the Community Benefits Fund in the Community Benefits Advisory Committee. This mechanism generates and distributes funds to nonprofits, and it&#39;s something that really sets Cambridge apart from other cities in the area. What I don&#39;t understand is why the city that has something that works so well wouldn&#39;t use it. and while i&#39;m concerned about the process that has gone through i&#39;m happy about the resolution i&#39;m just asking the city as you move forward to really use this process it&#39;s something that has shown to work it really helped out the city helped out the residents and helped distribute funds that otherwise wouldn&#39;t be there for for people in the community so again thank you for coming to the compromise but real am i my I would ask that as you move forward into the future that you use that process. Have a good evening and thank you for letting me talk tonight.</td>

We&#39;re located at 5 Calendar Street in Cambridge, and I&#39;m here to speak about unfinished business number six. I want to begin by thanking Mayor Simmons, Vice Mayor McGovern, and Councilors Wilson. and Siddiqui for their leadership in pushing for a more equitable outcome in this process. We know this was a difficult situation, and while the result isn&#39;t exactly what we originally hoped for, we recognize that it represents the best possible outcome under the circumstances. We&#39;re encouraged that over $3 million will now be allocated to the Community Benefits Fund. That change was not inevitable. It came about because of collective advocacy from residents, nonprofits, and counselors who stood up for a more transparent and community-centered process. We&#39;re also deeply grateful to Biomed for their significant investment in the Cambridge community. Their support has the potential to strengthen our city&#39;s nonprofit ecosystem and improve outcomes for families across Cambridge when paired with an equitable and inclusive funding process. I also want to express deep appreciation for our many nonprofit partners who engage in this process, many of whom are here today. Over the past two months, we&#39;ve seen a great deal of unity across the nonprofit sector in Cambridge. Organizations from every part of the city came together to speak with one voice in support of equity, transparency, and shared opportunity. At CCC, we&#39;ve been serving families for over 90 years. We know firsthand that no one organization or neighborhood can meet the needs of our city alone. This was never about stopping investment specifically in East Cambridge. It was about making sure that when major public impact funding is on the table, the process includes everyone and the outcomes benefit more people throughout the city. We remain committed to working with city council and our nonprofit partners to strengthen how these decisions are made in the future so that all voices in our city are heard and reflected in both process and outcome. Thank you for your time. I appreciate it.</td>

She included a link to a report by the Housing and Neighborhood and Long-Term Planning Committees that addressed, among other things, zoning recommendations for Mass Ave north of Harvard Square. The report contains at least five references to St. James and photos. Some of these are, they listed the church as a key community asset and showed a photo of the courtyard. They indicated that the St. James lawn is an opportunity for improved public space and included another picture and identified the courtyard as a publicly accessible open space. Last, St. James is included as a partner in action in an item called Creating More Space for the Community to Gather, Partner with Property Owners and Institutions to Activate Underutilized Spaces. It&#39;s obvious from the report that the joint committee values St. James&#39; and the courtyard in particular. The care team is still in the rollout phase and cannot yet provide 24-7 responses. I urge the council and community safety department to consider additional funding for 24-7 service. Last week, during a recent torrential rainstorm, when I was going home, I was soaked. I saw many people standing inside the St. James&#39;s Porches. Perhaps some of them were our usual unhoused neighbors. I&#39;m glad St. James&#39;s Porches were available to them.</td>

I&#39;ve been a member of St. James&#39;s Church for 34 years and I&#39;m currently on the vestry. I&#39;m here to speak about policy order number three. St. James&#39;s answers a calling based on our faith to welcome unhoused people and to provide a relatively safe space for them during the night. This can be easy when everybody follows the rules, stay on the porches, stay out of the garden at night, no drugs or alcohol, no litter or loud noise, but everybody doesn&#39;t always follow the rules. Often someone is drunk or high and forgets or doesn&#39;t care. Pleasantly, it&#39;s sometimes another unhoused person who keeps the noisy behavior in check. We understand that it is difficult to live next door to a noisy situation, and some of the Beach Street condominium unit&#39;s windows open to the side where one of our porches In the city, we sometimes get loud neighbors and have to close windows. The problem some residents complain about take place outside their windows, not outside their door. Residents cannot use the garden doors after dusk. The garden doors give access to church space, not residences. The residents enter the building way around the corner on Beach Street. It is our wish to work with the residents through mediation to develop a way for us to welcome unhoused people, which is mutually satisfactory. Mutual to the residents, to the church, and to our unhoused porch guests. Following that, we wish to work with the city to tease out this problem, which must be common with respect to city parks, parking lot, and to other public places. What does the city do in response to similar complaints? We look forward to learning from discussion with you. Thank you.</td>

The 2025 AHU annual report shows a strong affordable housing development. Similarly, the April 18th, 2024 housing data and facts announced a robust overall housing development. On the other hand, during the multi-journey petition debates, and it&#39;s still continuing, we were told we were falling short of the Envision 2030 housing goals. These two positions can both be true. How could we have robust housing development now, but we can&#39;t reach housing goals in five to six years? If AHO project had been properly factored in, We might have seen we were already on track, possibly avoiding the need to change zoning in the first place. I urge you to press the city manager to explain the contradiction and to post any new zoning amendment until we get a clear picture answer. On CMA 21, the electronic records archiving policy proposal misses a critical component. Archiving policy based on modern, unified digital system that allows the public to search records directly and improves coordination across departments. For a city that values transparency and lacks no brain power, this is long overdue. Please hire MIT students on a summer internship or work-study program to implement this right once and for all.

I want to just first of all thank Mayor Simmons, Councilor Toner, and Vice Mayor McGovern for bringing this public order forward. It&#39;s very, very important and I strongly urge you to approve it. There are two ideas that actually stand out to me in looking at this whole situation. One is control and the other is safety. There have been rules in place regarding the time when the unhoused can be in the porches. And there&#39;s policy against drugs, a policy against littering, and loud noise. I walk my dog every morning early. I have never ever in the four years I&#39;ve been here seen the unhoused out of the porches by dusk. I mean, sorry, by dawn. Not once. So that isn&#39;t enforced. Some of the people in the church come by and they begin to look after things and they&#39;re doing their best, I understand. But there are some things that they cannot govern, drug use. They&#39;re not going to go around and examine everyone and make sure that no one has drugs. Drug use has been a real problem. It has resulted in shouting matches and in violence and in arrests. It has also been involved in terms of safety that we have found on the grounds of the garden needles. We have found small bottles with not completely digested liquor. And that is something that I think really takes precedent over everything else. It has to be safe, because this is a public square.</td>

I also had the chance to speak to the person who runs the outdoor church. which is a significant organization that addresses issues related to homelessness. Also, just a remarkably thoughtful and attentive and careful person. Since I agree with most of what&#39;s been said about the issues here, I thought it was more important just to affirm that the people we have are remarkably kind and thoughtful and effective, and just a note of general appreciation.

Thank you for the chance to speak to you today. Councillors Nolan and Sobrinho-Wheeler have proposed language that helps prevent Cambridge PD from facilitating ICE raids, this language is appropriate and good. Standing aside from ICE raids is better than facilitating them. But this language won&#39;t incentivize ICE agents to unmask or to behave less abusive. In fact, this proposed language is nowhere near all that Cambridge can do under the law. Federal and state law does not forbid Cambridge PD from protecting residents by asking purported ICE agents for their name and badge number. And if the purported agent refuses, beating them as regular members of the public. We understand that Cambridge PD doesn&#39;t want to do that. They won&#39;t do anything that might pose any risk to officer safety. even if it would promote community safety, the safety of poor, vulnerable and marginalized people in the city who are under renewed attack from the federal government. We understand that the police union&#39;s priority is to protect its own members, not the community at large. But the administration and the city council don&#39;t have to give the police union a veto over what gets done. Cambridge PD should be shouldering some of the risk here. We have proposed language that complies with all federal and state laws. We urge the city to work with us and with other community groups who believe there is more that the city can do to revisit this topic and to do better. Thank you.</td>

And you all already heard me at the committee meeting on the need to strengthen our welcoming communities ordinance. So today I am here to speak in opposition to policy order three. Just a few months ago, there were residents of the Transition Wellness Center who were pleading with you to keep their shelter open. We heard from all of you about how great the shelter was, but when push came to shove, you and our city manager said that we couldn&#39;t afford it and it got shut down. Now, some of you are trying to pay police to harass our unhoused neighbors overnight, presumably contributing to their already obscene overtime costs. How can we possibly be this callous? I expect this. I expect this from our anti-democratic Supreme Court who supports criminalizing unsheltered existence. I expect this from Trump with his executive order to lock people up who are experiencing mental illness or homelessness. I expect this from our governor, frankly, who gutted the right to shelter. But I hope for better from Cambridge. I hope that you all could look at CPD over the past week using chemical weapons on anti-genocide protesters and even on tenants sleeping in their apartments. And I hope you could understand that more policing won&#39;t make any of us safer. The fact that some of you even proposed this makes me worry that that hope was misplaced. I hope the majority of you At least, we&#39;ll reject this crackdown on our most vulnerable neighbors. If you want to call this a welcoming community, you need to act like it. Thank you.</td>

                <td> Thank you and good afternoon. My name is Laura Rotillo and I am here on behalf of the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts and our many members who live in Cambridge in strong support of the proposed amendments to the welcoming community ordinance. These amendments were created to really meet the moment in which we are living. It&#39;s a moment when communities and families are under attack, when immigration arrests have more than tripled in Massachusetts, and when we&#39;re seeing masked agents take our neighbors and friends from our city streets. And while no city or state can fully stop the federal government from carrying out its agenda, or from detaining people, or can even ask them or compel them to stop wearing masks, there is much that we can do at the state and local levels. And Cambridge has always been a leader in this respect. This amendment is just the latest in the city&#39;s long history as a welcoming community for all, and it seeks to update language that could be abused by federal agencies and could lead the Cambridge Police Department in being implicated in basically ICE&#39;s cruel, cruel work. It directs police to make reasonable efforts to verify that those operating in the city are federal agents, and it clarifies police roles in responding to the scene of an immigration action. Time and again, Cambridge has said it will not use its city resources to aid federal immigration enforcement, and that commitment could not be more important today. So for that, I just want to thank the city council members, the ordinance committee, the police department, and the Cambridge advocates who engaged so thoughtfully in this process. And I ask this body to approve the amended language. Thank you so much.</td>

We&#39;ve had many thoughts and many words have transpired over the last few weeks in multiple discussions considering the questions brought up by some of us regarding the gift of Biomed Realty of $20 million. The Dance Complex prides itself as an international center for dance. With all we serve, we&#39;re intergenerational. We&#39;re from all socioeconomic backgrounds. realms, predominantly BIPOC and queer and disabilities communities. We are multiple cultures dancing dances from the world over, living among each other. While the dance complex contributes to the preservation and ongoing creation of world culture, we also provide the necessary preventative care for the public&#39;s mental health and physical health as well. There are times when we have challenging conversations amidst our walls, and it&#39;s natural when multiple points of view are present. But we bring the gifts of the conciliatory acts of dance and good dialogue and good dancing. We are grateful for the unique dance and the conciliatory acts we have been involved with with all of you. and conversations among Cambridge nonprofits and members of the council and others. All of us at the DC are grateful, especially for the counselors who went deeply into their life skills, and yes, your dancing skills, I was watching. Leading, following, taking turns, listening, observing these simple things, holding hands with ideas we brought forth in the past few weeks regarding equitable and transparent processes thank you mayor simmons vice mayor mcgovern counselor sadiki and wilson especially for your engagement in this process i believe our conversation illuminated many aspects of the process that were flawed i think we can come back to that at a future point uh we want to uh uh We hope that the future processes, including support through community benefits funds, find their way to more transparent, equitable, and timely open dialogues. We are grateful for your support. We&#39;re grateful for the gift to us, and we will support our next beginnings of our capital campaign with those funds. Thank you.</td>

                <td> Yeah, hi, Stan Rifkin, 17 Channing Street. First, I want to support the compromise for the Biomed Community Benefits Fund. I think we also need to establish guidelines, as several folks have said, for more transparent and equitable distribution of the CBF funds going forward. We also need to provide far more support for our amazing nonprofit community, ensuring that we&#39;re not pitting various nonprofits against one another for survival. And then within the confines of the anti-aid amendment, I would like the city to explore a matching program for community benefit funds, expanding the resources available to nonprofits, especially for a portfolio of projects that is meant to address capital expenses as is needed by the East End House presently. I&#39;m also strongly opposing policy order three. We just closed, as several folks have mentioned, a 58-bed homeless shelter for no good reason. And now the sponsors are surprised that more people are sleeping outside in spaces they didn&#39;t used to. I can&#39;t imagine how that&#39;s a surprise. But where are these people going to go? by giving the city manager the instruction to take quote all appropriate action without elaboration the city council is once again following the trump administration&#39;s recent recommendation to incarcerate our unhoused community this is cruel excessive and premature mediation has not started we don&#39;t know if they have anywhere else to go we haven&#39;t heard about physical barriers being implemented or other nonviolent resolutions being considered short of this policy order. None of this is discussed in the order, and this is a clear invitation to once again take advantage of the cover provided by the Trump administration to neglect our lowest income neighbors. MAGA relies on people believing that nobody really cares about low-income people, that everyone&#39;s goal is merely to enrich themselves, and that progressives who profess altruism and empathy are merely engaging in a collective performance. This provides moral cover for their apathy and indifference. Here in supposedly progressive Cambridge, we can either affirm this philosophy or roundly reject it by supporting our lowest-income neighbors. Thank you.</td>

I&#39;m speaking against policy order three and the policing of people sleeping outside. We need less policing in the city overall. Just this weekend, Cambridge police tear gassed an apartment building full of people and then pepper sprayed a crowd of protestors engaging in their First Amendment rights just yesterday, including my own partner. This police force is brutal and unruly and I have only seen them be aggressive towards my community members. I don&#39;t trust them to safely police our most vulnerable populations in any capacity. In addition to that, you yourself shut down a 58 bed shelter just this season. You shut down the shelter and now you have an issue with people sleeping outside. This is a problem that you caused and then didn&#39;t find a solution to. Why don&#39;t you invest the money that would go towards the salaries of over-policing the unhoused and put towards services that will actually benefit our communities? You keep claiming that we&#39;re a sanctuary city, but you don&#39;t act like it. Aside from this, I also support the amendments to the welcoming committee to stop collaboration between CPD and ICE. In this day and age, over-policing and cooperation with fascists will only go poorly for everyone involved. Thank you.</td>

                <td>Good evening. My name is Erin, and I&#39;m the Executive Director of Community Art Center. We&#39;ve been serving Cambridge families since the Great Depression. We&#39;re largely a black and brown organization. 93% of our families come from low income situations. The port neighborhood where we operate has been transformed by gentrification. But public investments tied to that development haven&#39;t reached us. We don&#39;t even own our own space. That means that time and energy meant for our youth is instead spent fundraising to fix a building we don&#39;t even control. On top of that, we&#39;ve been over capacity for years. When a neighborhood organization closed their childcare program, we absorbed all of their children without new funding. Because it was the right thing to do, and that&#39;s what community organizations do. We step up. But the constant hustle to fill systemic gaps is not sustainable. And frankly, I&#39;m tired of hearing about what a broken and insular process yields. We&#39;ve heard from organizations and leaders across the city, some even in East Cambridge. None but one seem to have been invited to the table over and over again. And there is nothing disingenuous about shining a light on exclusionary process, one that took place in an echo chamber. More to the point, aren&#39;t we all a bit tired of this winner-takes-all mentality that has permeated our national politics? Cambridge can do better. And through the Community Benefits Fund, we&#39;ve already built a more collaborative, equitable model. This isn&#39;t about dismantling an agreement. It&#39;s about carving out a modicum of support for colleagues across Cambridge who are also serving East Cambridge residents. I want to thank the councilors who recognized that and fought for fairness. They exhibited political courage and moral courage. Thank you to Mayor Simmons, Vice Mayor McGovern, Councilor Wilson, and Councilor Siddique, who saw something flawed and advocated to make it more right. We greatly appreciate your leadership. Thank you.</td>

I&#39;m a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, and I would like to speak today in opposition to policy order number three, This council and this government voted just a few months ago to close 58 bed homeless shelter at the Transition Wellness Center. And now today we&#39;re looking for solutions to a problem with outside sleepers. And what we&#39;re putting forward in this policy order, what has been put forward is criminalization as a solution. I urge people to vote no on this and also to consider exercising the charter right on this policy until mediation can take place. Criminalization will not be the solution. And as the federal government moves to criminalize homelessness on an unprecedented scale, we must not accept that as a solution in Cambridge. Housing is the solution to being unhoused. I will also speak in favor of the amendments to the Welcoming Communities Ordinance. It&#39;s a necessary improvement to the policy that our city is not going to collaborate with ICE. Thank you.</td>

                <td>Hi, dear city council. This is regards to 108. My name is Cheryl Hamlin, and I live at 7 Beach Street, directly overlooking the St. James Church and the garden. And I&#39;ve been watching over the past two years the situation in the church garden and how it&#39;s evolved. We were given rules created by the church to allow unhoused to sleep safely on the church porches, only the porches, from 10 p.m. to 7 a.m., and no drug use. Over time, it became clear that these policies could not be enforced. And last summer, I witnessed as more and more people were sleeping on the porch and spreading into the garden. There was obvious drug use, drug dealing. There was a full-on drug ring under my kitchen window. And all the things that go with that, needles, human feces around the garden, including near a school bus stop. We worked with the church, and we did not involve the police. But by September, there was a full-on encampment, people coming and going all day long. And typically, the activity will decrease over the winter, but it never goes away. So this spring, when I started to see increased activity, and by June, nightly intoxication, witness self-injections, and loudness during the night, and people coming and staying later, it finally prompted me to call the police. Look, I don&#39;t want to be the person who tells people to move along. I don&#39;t want to criminalize homelessness. But it breaks my heart to see people sleeping on church porches and on the street and young people destroying their bodies with nightly drug use. But I don&#39;t want to look out my window every morning and worry if someone has overdosed when it&#39;s serious enough that I should call the police. I want to feel safe walking to and from my home, whether it&#39;s early in the morning or later at night. And so I ask you to move forward to finding a solution. Thank you.</td>

As you may remember, we were previously here a few months ago to share stories, thoughts, and worries as the council began to decide who will be their new cleaning contractor. Hiring a responsible contractor is crucial to workers as they can make a difference in how they&#39;re treated and compensated for a while on the job. We sent letters, shared thoughts and concerns, and made clear that this decision must not be made lightly. But thankfully, you heard our concerns and did the right thing. By awarding the contract to a union senator, you demonstrated the importance of standing with workers and preserving labor peace. All workers deserve the right to a fair, livable wage that allows them to support their families. Thank you for hearing our concerns and seeing us beyond our uniforms that we have loved ones who depend on us to provide for them. And thank you for awarding the contract to an employer that has historically supported workers and unions and will allow us to continue in our roles safely and effectively.</td>

I wanna try to cover a few things, but first I strongly urge you to vote against policy order number three or at least try to write it for now because it&#39;s not dignified as it stands and does not approach our residents with care. And this way you prolong homelessness instead of addressing it with actual systemic advances like housing and services. But I mean, how can we even do that when we close the homeless shelter or haven&#39;t even expanded services? We need to be more intentional about this, especially when we&#39;ve heard mediation hasn&#39;t happened. If you pass this order, you&#39;re going to make people experiencing homelessness feel less safe. Within the past month, I witnessed the police arrest a homeless person based on what they claimed was trespassing when it was explicitly not trespassing and proceeded to scramble to find a reason for their arrest when I pointed out that it was an unlawful arrest. So I am worried if the police will treat these residents experiencing homelessness with dignity and care. Please take more time to thoroughly address this instead of moving forward with how it stands currently. I know we can be mindful of every party involved without treating people experiencing homelessness like criminals. I just also want to say thank you to all the members of the St. James Episcopal Church for supporting these residents, and I hope we can find a productive way to resolve this situation. I also want to encourage you guys to support the further language changes for the welcoming city ordinance to ensure CBD does not work with ICE in any way and to support implementing non-police flaggers for construction projects and more. as well as please support policy order number five concerning increased needle boxes and as well as supporting equitable allocation and investment of community benefits. The situation that happened there has highlighted the dire need of support to our nonprofits across the board. I&#39;m looking forward to reading the interim report on the demolition requests and thank you for your time.</td>

I am a resident and since 2017, I&#39;ve been a member of the Community Benefits Advisory Committee. I&#39;m speaking in support of the compromise to allocate $3.2 million from the Biomed Realty Petition to the Community Benefits Fund. I&#39;m grateful to the counselors who have worked on this compromise to help a broader number of nonprofits, many of which are facing increased financial challenges and need other channels of resources. Allocation of funds to the Community Benefits Fund is the most equitable and transparent means for distribution of funds. The Community Benefits Advisory Committee worked diligently since 2017 to create a process to distribute the first round of Community Benefit funds fairly and with accountability across a spectrum of nonprofits, so has the expertise to manage this new allocation. The $3.2 million allocation will be added to the existing 1.6 million remaining from the original pool of 7 million in mitigation funds and will leverage needed dollars for Cambridge nonprofits. In closing, I implore the city council to review CBAC&#39;s report presented to you in June, which details the distribution of funds in phase one, as well as the $2 million in emergency COVID relief funding. It is imperative that the council evaluate and revise, if necessary, the mitigation process so we don&#39;t repeat the missteps and false starts made with this original petition. Thank you.</td>

My name is Pedro Spivakovsky-Gonzalez, and I am the executive director of the Community Dispute Settlement Center, a community mediation center located at 60 Gore Street. We&#39;ve been serving Cambridge and the greater Boston community since the 1970s. Our mission is to empower individuals and communities to solve problems collaboratively. through conflict resolution services and training. We have trained and provided conflict resolution services to thousands of people over the years, including over 2,000 last year, more than doubling our services compared to the previous year. So we do a lot with very little, like a lot of other nonprofits here, as many of you know. But as representatives from the Cambridge Nonprofit Coalition have mentioned, it has become a challenging time for local nonprofits, with big changes happening at the federal, state, and local levels. At the federal level, for example, there have been cuts to AmeriCorps, and our organization will no longer be able to host an AmeriCorps member this year as we did last year. Meanwhile, at the state level, there have been funding cuts as well to community mediation, as the Commonwealth considers different funding priorities in response to federal challenges. So at the local level, many nonprofits are applying to private foundations in an environment that&#39;s really challenging, and there are many worthy causes. The clients we serve every day are facing an onslaught of challenges from housing insecurity to crushing debt loads and more. So it&#39;s a particularly important time to support local nonprofits and the rich tapestry of organizations that make up the Cambridge nonprofit sector. So I support the allocation of funding to the Community Benefits Fund as part of a compromise on the Biomed Realty East Cambridge Community Enhancement Petition. I want to especially thank Councilor Siddiqui, Wilson, Vice Mayor McGovern, and Mayor Simmons for reaching a compromise that will help to fund the work of local nonprofits serving East Cambridge. As a community mediation center, and though I&#39;m not speaking in a neutral capacity here, it&#39;s no surprise that we appreciate a good compromise. And of course, we also appreciate value creation and win-win agreements, as we hope this will be. Thank you very much for your time.</td>

I help my East Cambridge neighbors on a daily basis with things like SNAP, health insurance. financial education, and the food pantry. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair that one neighborhood agency got millions of dollars while others, nonprofits who serve East Cambridge, were left out. I wish I had been aware of the process to decide how this money was spent. I support compromise, amend that, but I wish other Cambridge nonprofits could have a fair share. Thank you.</td>

                <td>Good evening. Good evening. Name is Lawrence Atkins, 45 Hay Street. I&#39;m here because of the biotech meal to compromise. First, I want to say I did not find out about this compromise until 10 a.m. this morning, so I don&#39;t know what transparency one is talking about, seeing that they reached out to us instantly, and I just found out about this this morning. Unfortunately, I&#39;m going to be in the number of the dissenting group. It&#39;s healthy to have dissenting amongst folk who are supposed to have conversations. But let me specify this. The Community Benefit Fund had a great opportunity, which was to start this thing off correctly. Because all of you know the encompassing time to do this right makes it severely difficult from this point on. You have a winner of two thirds of the $20 million. There&#39;s been no statement made about their further participation as being a non-profit Cambridge member. And I&#39;m certain if you didn&#39;t, I want my hand in any prize you got and you could tell me I couldn&#39;t be a participant. Again, we should have a community benefits process that&#39;s for the city as a whole. That entire selection of money should go into that bucket and there needs to be that singularity of everybody competing and a clear transparency for even an outsider like myself to be in the audience of this conversation because all that I&#39;ve heard today There&#39;s only been selected members of nonprofit, executive directors, associate directors, whatever. But we, who stood here on that evening, took our time to be involved and let it known to be what was wrong, did not receive a single invitation. Thank you.</td>

It is taking unfair advantage of the mistaken changes in educational and religious institutional zoning that your residential zoning changes have created. For decades, the city of Cambridge has held a compelling government interest to keep educational and religious institutional development to a minimum in residential neighborhoods through a selected exclusion from the Dover Amendment. This was based upon the city leaders understanding of the effect of intensity of use on residential neighborhoods. Specifically, as it pertains to protecting both the quantity of housing units as well as the quality of their environments from excessive traffic, parking, trash, noise, et cetera, from high non-residential development. Please consider this contrast. When you build a 40,000 square foot residential structure, code allows 200 residents. When you build a 40,000 square foot institutional religious assembly building, as is being done in Bank Street, code allows 2,000 patrons. That is 10 times intensity of use. Current zoning recognizes the difference in use characteristics and seeks to provide reasonable protection. Please do not allow these to be lost. Note that HubBot has over 10 properties in Cambridge ready to take advantage of the benefit that their proposed zoning amendment would allow. Also remember the dictates of the Dover Amendment, religious and educational institutions must be treated equally within zoning. Thus, should the council provide zoning exemptions to religious institutions, the Dover Amendment can be used by educational institutions to require the same rights as religious structures. The effect would be catastrophic. Please reject the Mariseo zoning petition. Direct the CDD to develop a more comprehensive institutional development plan. AND WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH LONG-TERM VALUES OF THE CITY AND DEFENDABLE IN THE CONTEXT OF RELUPA LAW. THANK YOU.</td>

                <td>GOOD EVENING. My name is Donnie Harding, I live at 181 Windsor Street. I&#39;m here to speak about the sharing of the bio-med mitigation funds received by the East End House. First, let me begin by congratulating them on their success in securing these funds. Their advocacy is commendable. Had we in the port had similar representation during the development of Kendall Square, I might not be standing here now, and the city might be far wealthier for it. But we didn&#39;t. To be honest, if the East End House were not part of the Red Feather Agency, a coalition that served all the settlement houses in Cambridge equally for the last 75 years, starting in the 1920s, I wouldn&#39;t be here speaking. The mission of the Red Feather Agency was rooted in sharing and collective support. But when did that stop? Or have we now allowed ourselves to be influenced by the divisiveness of this 21st century? But this isn&#39;t about one agency. This is about the youth of Cambridge. The sharing of these funds means investing directly in the future, the children and the young people of today that you, the city council, are sworn to serve. You are their caretakers today. Let them benefit from the victories and the resources that were earned today. I urge you, please vote to share the BioMed funds. with federal funds cuts affecting nonprofits, it&#39;s harder for fund raising to become harder for nonprofits. This may be the only opportunity we have to ensure that all of our community resources Survive the next five years. Do what your conscience tells you to do. Do what&#39;s right for today&#39;s kids. In fact, you shouldn&#39;t be voting for 5 million, you should be voting to share $10 million. Thank you.</td>

I&#39;m the Director of Finance and Operations at the Community Arts Center, and I&#39;m not here tonight to advocate for the Community Arts Center. I&#39;m here advocating for the 80-plus other nonprofits throughout the city of Cambridge. I&#39;m here to support a compromise that&#39;s been put forth to the grossly one-sided allocation of public funds to the East End HUS through a process that was demonstrably one-sided. I read in Cambridge Day a quote from Bob Zimka where he admits that at least one-third of his hand-picked committee included individuals associated directly with East End House. Not one organization or person was identified in that article that represented the Cambridge Nonprofit Coalition or any of the other nonprofits around the city. This arrangement lies in the face of historic precedent and the intentions of this City Council when the Community Benefits Fund was originally created. This one project is providing to one organization three times the money that the Community Benefits Fund has paid out in the past 10 years in total. and we need to acknowledge that not taking a more holistic view of this development and the fees being generated by it is in direct contravention of the goals of the fund and the CNC. In addition, to directly address the statement the East End House needs the full 20 million, I would suggest that they may have to pare back their needs or their wants, just like the rest of us are doing in these tough times. The compromise being offered tonight is still inadequate, However, I am supporting the resolution at the compromise figures that are being offered in the interest of supporting East Cambridge and the exciting project by Biomed Realty. I want to thank the members of the council who have tried to negotiate a more reasonable sharing of the Biomed fees for their time and courage. I strongly urge a unanimous vote in favor of the modified fee arrangement.</td>

Special thanks first to Mayor Simmons, Vice Mayor McGovern, and Counselors Siddiqui and Wilson for their leadership, their time, and energy in working on this issue in negotiating this compromise over the last month. The issues of development in zoning are ones that our city has been grappling with for decades, and it will remain so for the future. Equity and fairness are goals in our city for all that goes on here as well. While the compromise is not what CEOC and the other nonprofits recommended originally, It deserves approval along with a commitment of all of us to strengthen the development process for major businesses, bringing more transparency to bear, and strengthening the existing mitigation fund, as was mentioned earlier.

I&#39;m here to thank Councillor Nolan, Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler, Vice Mayor McGovern, and Councillor Siddiqui for their work in drafting Policy Order 2025-111 that supports the attempt of the members of US Congress to diminish the peril of nuclear war. It does this by urging that we take weapons off alert, that we eliminate presidential first use of nuclear weapons, that we stop the trillion-dollar budget for new nuclear weapons and that we work with other countries. This is done with HR 317, HRES 317 in the House, and SRES 323 in the Senate, the first introduced by Representative Jim McGovern from Massachusetts, of whom we can all be proud, and the second by Senator Markey from Massachusetts. This bill is urgent for three reasons. First, in the midst of very grave city matters that we&#39;ve been hearing about tonight, and they are grave. My heart goes out to all people trying to figure out the answer to them. There is a great peril from nuclear weapons. The former diplomat Thomas Countryman points out that nuclear weapons Global warming may destroy our civilization over the next 70 years, and nuclear weapons may destroy our civilization over the next 70 minutes. These two resolutions in Congress need your support. Presently, there are 28 co-sponsors in the House, but only one co-sponsor from Massachusetts other than Jim McGovern. and only four co-sponsors in the Senate. The resolution which you&#39;ve drafted addresses the need for more Massachusetts support. Thank you. Thank you.</td>

I&#39;m speaking tonight in support of the compromise East Cambridge community enhancement petition, unfinished business number six. We appreciate the $3.2 million that will be allocated to the community benefits fund. We wish that a larger sum of money could have been distributed to the greater nonprofit community through this fund, but we wholeheartedly appreciate Mayor Simmons, Vice Mayor McGovern, Councilor Siddiqui, and Councilor Wilson for advocating so tirelessly on behalf of the nonprofit community to reach this compromise agreement. At the last City Council meeting in June, the nonprofits were tasked with compromising and working together. The way that the Cambridge nonprofits came together to work out a solution was incredible to see, and many nonprofit leaders spent countless hours working through this issue. The Community Benefits Fund is critical for nonprofits, especially amidst uncertain and volatile funding environments. As demand for our services continues to increase, the Community Benefits Fund will provide a crucial, stabilizing resource for nonprofits like ours, and the more funding we can put into it, the better. We look forward to being part of the process to make future zoning mitigation agreements more equitable and transparent, such that all nonprofits have access to the funding. Thank you.</td>

It was really interesting to come here tonight and hear all the different perspectives on this issue. I came here to speak on my values and my beliefs and hearing all the different groups that have organized to come to this session tonight really sheds light on how complicated this matter is. I think it&#39;s really important to hear the human stories behind this issue, hearing the people who live there, the people who have nowhere else to stay, the people who are trying to help. I think we should not let ourselves fall into the mindset that this is just a nuisance thing. Right now, the Trump administration is actively attacking the weakest people in our city and research has shown over and over again that homelessness isn&#39;t a personal failing. It&#39;s not a character defect. It&#39;s not even caused by addiction. It&#39;s caused by housing policies first and foremost. people want to be housed and I think that&#39;s pretty clear from everyone&#39;s perspectives tonight that people need housing they want housing and we as a city have the ability to give that to people I think it&#39;s reprehensible that we&#39;re still closing housing shelters in our city as recently as last season and then turning around and complaining that we have people living unhoused I think it&#39;s pretty obvious that we are making the decisions that are putting people on the street. And we are the ones that have to fix it through the same mechanisms that put them on the street in the first place. Thank you.</td>

                <td> Hello, my name is Richard Solomon. I&#39;m a resident of 9 Kinnaird Street. I&#39;m speaking against policy order number three, which requests additional enforcement tools to target groups of outside sleepers. This policy order will harm the people who are surviving poverty on our streets. It will put them in grave danger. of police violence and worsening living conditions. Just yesterday, I was tear gassed in the face by Cambridge cops at a protest in Harvard Square. And two days before that, I saw them pump tear gas into a six-story apartment building where they had told the residents to shelter during a standoff. And they were in bad shape when they came out. And so if that&#39;s what they&#39;re doing to people like me or to residents of that building, what are they doing to the homeless? It&#39;s clear that they&#39;re using chemicals as a crowd control. They&#39;re violating city ordinance. And if they&#39;re not defunded or prosecuted, there&#39;s not gonna be any accountability and they won&#39;t change their behavior. Policy order three, voting no on it is a concrete measure to punish the cops and redirect public resources to life affirming and publicly useful activities. Instead of fighting to keep the transitional wellness center open or expanding shelter access, to keep our neighbors housed, the mayor and councilor Toner would rather side with Trump&#39;s goal to criminalize homelessness. And that&#39;s really appalling to see this policy order just less than a week after Trump&#39;s own executive order calling on cities to criminalize homelessness. In addition, I&#39;d like to speak in favor of the amendments to the welcoming community ordinance to remove police presence at construction sites. It&#39;s not effective or cost-conscious for taxpayers to have cops standing around outside construction sites. I worry about the massive waste of public resources. I think it serves as a sink for police overtime. We should be putting our public resources to life-affirming public services, not the cops.</td>

                <td> DEBORAH EPSTEIN, 36 BANK STREET, FOR THE LAST 37 YEARS. I&#39;M SPEAKING AGAINST THE MARASAL ZONING AMENDMENT. FOR THE CARRIE CORNER NEIGHBORHOOD ASSOCIATION&#39;S COUNCIL WITH LEGAL SPECIALISTS IN RELUPA LAW WHO SPECIFICALLY REPRESENT UNICIPALITIES IN RELUPA CASES, PETITIONER&#39;S ASSERTION THAT IT IS ENTITLED TO FULL APPROVAL FOR THEIR ZONING AMENDMENT UNDER RELUPA IS NOT CORRECT AND IS A MISREPRESENTATION OF FEDERAL LAW. We question the conclusions of the city solicitor. The petitioner&#39;s fear tactics seem to be working, unfortunately. However, there are other points of view backed by case law. Here are some highlights. RELUPA does not provide religious institutions with immunity from land use regulation. The onus is on the petitioner to show that a zoning board&#39;s denial or conditional approval of a particular sized project would substantially burden its sincerely held religious beliefs for a particular project with a particular dimension in a particular location. Many cases explain that a religious institution is not entitled to build a project without size or other reasonable limitations. The Zoning Board has the authority to request a smaller proposal without running afoul of RELUPA. RELUPA does not give religious institutions the right to circumvent the application process and or omit essential elements of a typical land use application. The Zoning Board need not consider the petitioner&#39;s religious needs at some indefinite point in the future or give credit to a speculative assertion that it requires almost unlimited capacity. By using the rules already in place, the boards and commissions of the city of Cambridge can oversee proposals and make sure that religious institutions get what they need, not necessarily what they want. The proposed zoning amendment would discriminate against many of the citizens of Cambridge. Thank you.</td>

First, I want to thank Mayor Simmons, Vice Mayor McGovern, and Councilors Siddiqui and Wilson for their tireless work over the past weeks. to seek a compromise that would have allowed more equitable funding to go to the entire nonprofit community rather than to only one agency. The compromise before you tonight doesn&#39;t achieve the $5 million that the nonprofit community had hoped for. but we have come to terms with the realization that there are not enough votes to reach a more equitable outcome and therefore ask you to support it. We are pleased that in this deal some funds will be put into the Community Benefits Fund and CEOC is certainly pleased that we are receiving funding which will go right back out into the community in the form of rent and utility payments along with cash grants to low-income families and seniors, many of them living in East Cambridge. I&#39;m also pleased that the past weeks have not led to what has been characterized by some as infighting between the nonprofit community. In fact, the opposite is true. It has brought many of us together in a unified force with a commitment to ensure that future mitigation dollars are put into the community benefits fund that all nonprofits have access to, to continue the important work that we all do. We are committed to ensure that we are present at all meetings where these decisions are made so that 14 handpicked people in one neighborhood will not be able to make further decisions that impact the entire city. We will not be told again that a strong inclusive community process has taken place when only one nonprofit was ever made aware of any of these meetings. This new process will help us to actually have good governance. Thank you.</td>

As a former director of CEOC, we were one of the nonprofits that worked to establish the community benefits process that created an open and equitable and transparent procedure for all nonprofits to apply for community benefits. Clearly, this zoning ordinance proposal did not follow the established community benefits process and allowed this ordinance to move forward with little oversight and understanding of the community benefits process. I realize that tonight there is a proposal to try to address the inequitable process to date. but the damage is done. Nonprofits have been wrongly and negatively portrayed. They were demonized for their advocacy for an equitable distribution of these funds to be able to serve their participants. This was the goal of community benefits, that these funds serve all community individuals and families, regardless of their address. Individual and family need in Cambridge is not determined by geographic location. Going forward, I hope that the negative lessons learned from this flawed process will result in the city returning to the successful community benefits process. Thank you.</td>

I am fourth generation East Cambridge, and I speak to you this evening as the member of the board of directors of the Dante Alighieri Cultural Society. I would just like to remind everyone present that the Dante has been with us for 40 years. It has served the neighborhoods Of Cambridge and beyond, it has provided scholarships for Cambridge high school students for the language programs, which are played us. And also scholarships for students who are studying Italian culture in Italy to actually finance trips. Also, most of the functions are open to the public. We have core Dante. which is a choral group open to the public for participation, invited to the State House every year for the Italian Heritage Month. I say this as a reminder that it&#39;s an active nonprofit. We were never at the table. As a fourth generation East Cambridge person, I signed a petition which was totally ignored. There were over 100 people opposed to the BioMed upzoning. We need housing. We don&#39;t need more labs. That is a huge lab undertaking, incredibly dense and high, right in the neighborhood.

                <td> Hello, my name is Kosar Muhammad. I have had the privilege of serving as a caseworker at the Community Art Center since 2021. When I first stepped into this role, my position was funded directly through the Community Benefits Fund. That&#39;s just a detail. It&#39;s a clear example of how this fund has already been put to meaningful, tangible use. It&#39;s a living proof of the vision behind it. I&#39;m here tonight to express my full support for continued public funding, funding that truly serves all of Cambridge. I firmly believe that some portion of every zoning and development dollar that comes through the city should be set aside for community benefits fund. That is not just a good policy. It is honoring the intention behind the 15 years of community organizing that made this fund a reality. It&#39;s a longstanding commitment to equity, inclusion, and shared investment. This fund matters because we in Cambridge take care of each other. Whether it is in housing, education, food security, arts, or beyond, the Community Benefit Fund helps local groups and nonprofits meet people where they are. I can tell you personally, I work with clients from all corners of the city, I collaborate with organizations across the neighborhood, and I witness every day how people are grappling with enormous challenges. Job loss, food insecurity, unstable housing, lack of access to childcare and medical care. The need is real and it&#39;s growing. Unfortunately, as funding dries up, so do the safety nets that people rely on. That&#39;s why this moment calls for renewed commitment. The Community Benefit Fund is not just a pot of money, it is a tool for ensuring our shared prosperity now and into the future. I want to sincerely thank the city councilors who have stood up for that vision, those who pushed to ensure the Community Benefit Fund received necessary investment and who advocated for the fair distribution of the Biomed investment across the city. Thanks to Mary.</td>

                <td> Good evening. My name is Michelle Song, and I live on 401 Washington Street near Central Square in the Port. I&#39;m here to urge the City Council to approve the amendment that allocates $5 million of Biomed&#39;s mitigation funds to the Community Benefits Fund. The Community Benefits Fund was created after years of advocacy to ensure that developer contributions are distributed fairly and transparently across Cambridge&#39;s nonprofit sector. It&#39;s a model that works. During COVID-19, this fund provided over $2 million in emergency relief to nonprofits serving residents in every community. from housing and food security to education and the arts. Yet today, we&#39;re watching an inequitable process unfold. A $20 million direct allocation to a single organization on top of a prior $9 million deal undermines the very principles of equity and collective benefit that this fund was designed to uphold. This is not about diminishing the value of East End House. They&#39;re a very important partner. But this is about making sure that all of Cambridge&#39;s nonprofits, especially smaller organizations without political leverage, have a fair chance to access critical resources. To be clear, I believe the Community Benefits Fund deserves more than $5 million. But this amendment is a necessary step to restore fairness, transparency, and a citywide vision to this process. It&#39;s a reasonable compromise that acknowledges the East End House&#39;s role while reaffirming our commitment to equitable resource sharing. Cambridge is strongest when we invest in all of our communities, not just one. I strongly urge you to vote yes on this amendment. Thank you.</td>

                <td>Hi, my name&#39;s Kit Haines. I live at 101 Reed Street in North Cambridge. First, I support stopping police collaboration with ICE, but I think we can do better. We consistently refer to our police officers as brave, as police work, as high risk, and offer our police officers respect and a salary commensurate with that job. ICE is attacking our community, and police are uniquely qualified to protect our community by asking for names and badge numbers of ICE officials and treating them as members of the public if they refuse. But primarily, I want to speak in opposition to policy order number three. Living on the streets is terrifying, it&#39;s humiliating, it&#39;s shameful, and it brings out the worst in everyone. It&#39;s hard to find legal places to sleep, places to use the toilet, even places to panhandle. It&#39;s especially hard to face that shame when escapism is a needle away. Every single unhoused person I&#39;ve spoken to, even those sober, have some negative interaction with the police. It&#39;s hard to feel safe around someone who, at best, tells you off for trying to live. And it&#39;s hard to rest without feeling safe. I especially hope after this past week you can empathize with the people who don&#39;t feel safe around the police. Asking for police to get involved here is not helpful to our struggling unhoused neighbors. My heart does go out to the James Street neighbors because it&#39;s not comfortable to see unhoused neighbors struggle. It can feel more safe to send the issue away to some other park and some other sidewalk, but that doesn&#39;t help and it doesn&#39;t make anyone safe. If we are a welcoming city, we need to curb that impulse. Scaring people off with police won&#39;t stop anyone from using drugs. It will likely contribute to the shame and isolation that drives people to continue drug use in the first place. Unhoused members are not a threat to our community. ICE is a threat to our community. The solution to not having people unhoused is to provide housing, to open shelters, to find more affordable housing. It&#39;s not ask police officers to scare away people who aren&#39;t a threat and allow them to be cowards to people who are a threat. Thank you for your time.</td>

I&#39;ve been a resident of Cambridge for 41 years, and I&#39;m very committed to the city. i&#39;m glad to be able to speak late in the program today because i hope i can clear up some of the confusion i&#39;m speaking on behalf of policy order number 108 which seems also to be called order number three it is an order about the green space near the church it is not about the porches it is not about harassing the unhoused it is about managing drug transactions and drug abuse it is about the use of a green space that everyone including the condominium and the church have complete agreement that it will not be occupied during the dark hours of the day this is not in dispute It is not about police abuse. The peace officers of Cambridge are not doing anything with pepper spray. They are extremely sensitive to dealing with persons who have addiction issues and may also have homeless issues. We have all been impressed by the very fine services of the peace officers. The church does not provide any services that I&#39;m aware of to the unhoused. There is no water, there is no food, there are no sanitary facilities. The unhoused defecate and urinate. It&#39;s not unhoused, it&#39;s the drug addicts who are defecating and urinating in the green space. The order has nothing to do whatsoever with the mediation There&#39;s no reason for delay.</td>

First, I would like to reiterate that we had a petition that I submitted to the city council twice and had no feedback or no consideration on, and which was signed by, as Marie-HÃ©lÃ¨ne Tocascio pointed out, by almost 100 people that are direct about her to the project and have been completely left out of any of the conversation. The only thing I&#39;ve heard tonight and through the discussion was talks about money. How much money can we get from biomed? How that money is going to be distributed? The same process that has existed for the last 15 years and has been used by the city councilors to... to satisfy their constituency. It is astounding to me that none of the nonprofit was aware of contract zoning and of the benefits that each development provides to the city and the huge amounts of money that come into the coffer of the city through contract zoning and the negotiations of benefits. It is not thanks to the city council that there is a compromise. It is thanks to them that we are talking about money, but we are not talking about the neighborhood and the people who live there. We, the neighbors, who are going to be affected by this upzoning, which is going to bring an extra thousand people from the actual zoning that would be, if they, as of right, they would allow 750 people in the building that they can build. Now they&#39;re going to have 1,500 people in that building. Did the neighbor take a consideration? Did the city council approach the neighborhoods to understand what the problems of that extra density and that commercial development was going to be? No, they did nothing. They take the money. The only thing that they consider is the money. They are no different than Trump. And to get that illusion that our city council is better than Trump is just a fallacy. Thank you.</td>

I want to begin by thanking Mayor Denise Simmons, Counselors Ayesha Wilson, Ensemble Siddiqui, and Vice Mayor Mark McGovern and others for your leadership on unfinished business item number six, the Biomed Realty Project. We are at the Loop Lab in full support of this project and the compromise that moves funds into the Community Benefits Fund. That&#39;s a step in the right direction. I&#39;m also here to say the fund itself has to be equitable. We believe that the process by which it&#39;s distributed ultimately must also reflect the full diversity of the city of Cambridge, not just in name, but in presence, power, and partnership. For those who are uninitiated, I am Reverend Christopher Hope, a proud resident of the city of Cambridge, also the executive director of the Loop Lab. We are a nonprofit organization located in East Cambridge, and we train BIPOC young adults to get into the audio-video industry, many of whom are Cambridge-range Latin students and graduates, and we prepare them for careers in the audio-video industry and media technology. With that being said, us along with many other organizations that are located in East Cambridge were not included at any time or point in the process and our students at The Hive were not included. Organizations like the Multicultural Arts Center, De Novo and others that have spoken here and we want to advocate on our behalf as organizations that are located in East Cambridge in Kendall Square. I also, as a faith leader, have to say I was surprised that Cambridge Black Pastors Association, some other faith-based entities were also not a part of this conversation. Ultimately, we want to lift up the Cambridge Neighborhood Coalition for their fierce advocacy. We want to outline that this inclusion isn&#39;t symbolic, but it&#39;s structural. We&#39;re not here to ask for crumbs, but we&#39;re here to help set up the table. Thank you for your time, and we want to make sure that the feast ahead is for everyone to enjoy. Thank you.</td>

And it says between July, 2024 and July, 2025, the central square business improvement district collected 85,000 discarded needles in central square alone, including an average of 6,000 needles per month. Now, It seems like the city&#39;s administration and the council are kind of pushing policies that are in direct opposition to each other. On the one hand, basically encouraging and enabling injection drug use, and then worrying about the impact of the behavior of people who cannot or will not do what All these nonprofits are providing help, but it doesn&#39;t seem to be doing much good for a lot of people. I think we have to have some rules for people. It&#39;s not just the people who are doing drugs and stealing and whatnot who are vulnerable. It&#39;s all the rest of us who are also vulnerable as the city administration have abandoned the public realm to the behavior of people who, as someone had said earlier, cannot or will not follow even basic norms or rules.</td>

                <td> Hello. Thank you to the City Council and to the public for coming to tonight&#39;s meeting. My name is LaQueen Battle. I stay in East Cambridge on the border between Somerville, Everett, Boston, and Cambridge. I&#39;ll make this really quick because this has a lot to do about a lot of different topics. So here we go. I want to thank this Cambridge City Council, Mayor Denise Simmons, Vice Mayor Mark McGovern, Councilor Sumbul Siddiqui, Paul Turner, Alicia Wilson, and the rest of the council for recognizing the importance of the homeless shelter system. While the closure of any shelter takes away many critical resources from the community, the value of these services brings the people&#39;s lives cannot be overstated. With many shelters for the homeless and migrant families closing after the COVID-19 pandemic, I&#39;m grateful that the Cambridge continues to support this population through organizations such as Cambridge Women&#39;s Center, On the Rise, The Salvation Army, YWCA, Catholic Charities USA, and even Boston Healthcare for the Homeless, Cambridge Health Alliance, which alongside it, I celebrate my 40th birthday and its anniversary this year. It is truly a blessing that these organizations not only serve Cambridge and Boston, but also operate worldwide, providing essential resources to those in need. I was born in Fort Worth, Texas, and after going through the shelter system and receiving housing here in Cambridge, I consider it a miracle to now call this city home. Here, I had the opportunity to meet with Reverend Dr. Jeremy Battle of Harvard Divinity School and First Lady Jessica Battle of Western Avenue Baptist Church, whose family also comes from the South in Texas and Alabama. I&#39;ll make this really, really quick. I know there&#39;s a lot to do. I&#39;m on social media also. But anyways, I want to also highlight the importance of the nonprofit Heal Palestine, which recently brought three young girls from Gaza to the United States just yesterday, this morning, for medical treatment. Their efforts promote community engagement and understanding of the Gaza conflict, which many Americans are still learning about.</td>

                <td> Hi, my name is Danielle. I&#39;m a resident of Cambridge. I live on Tremont Street. I&#39;m calling in regard to policy order number three, as well as the unfinished business number seven with the welcoming ordinance update. In the wake of ongoing attacks from Trump administration, we have the choice as a city to decide whether we want to talk about protecting our residents or actually implement the policies that keep our residents safe. In regard to the unfinished business number seven, it&#39;s urgent that our city councilors use every single tool in their toolbox to minimize the extreme harm that ICE is inflicting on our communities and make sure that Cambridge Police Department is not putting any resources towards collaboration with ICE and that they do everything they can to protect our residents from these masked kidnappers. In regard to policy orders number three, I&#39;d like to speak out against it as the council is again faced with an option about whether we support our residents with humanity or whether we resort to an unjust carceral system to keep our unhoused neighbors out of sight. So we don&#39;t have to face the unjust systems. that have led them to sleeping outside. This is especially hypocritical following the city&#39;s decision to close the shelter and in light of the continued federal tax on our unhoused neighbors. There is no research that indicates criminalizing homelessness does anything to end homelessness. In fact, the most effective tools we have to end homelessness are to end our housing affordability and our unavailability crisis. This is where we should be spending our time and money, rather than putting it into the police force to criminalize homelessness, which just over the weekend has used chemical weapons against residents of Cambridge in affordable housing and those speaking out against the genocide in Gaza. I would like to lastly urge the council to implement the non-police traffic flaggers for construction so that we can redirect our city funds away from the police unnecessarily while keeping our streets and our community safe for all of our residents. Thank you.</td>

                <td> Hi, my name is Jacob Brown. I live on Magazine Street here in Cambridge. First off, I&#39;d love to support the updates to the welcoming community ordinance. I just think, yeah, it&#39;s incredibly important to maintain the separation between Cambridge Police and ICE and make sure that Cambridge Police is not assisting in their operations in any way. And that sort of leads into my main point, which is to speak against policy order number three, And again, I feel like these next few years are going to be defined by essentially just an existential battle against the ideology of the Trump administration. It&#39;s really a battle for cities that believe in our shared humanity against an administration that has made time and time again obvious that they seek to target cities that display that. And one of the things that we&#39;ve seen them target is this recent executive order essentially advocating for the criminalization of unhoused individuals. I think that&#39;s unconscionable and I really think that it is a huge mistake and a way to not only play into the hands of the Trump administration, but tear apart many of the bonds of our community to essentially give a greater toolbox for the criminalization and penalization of our unhoused community members. These are our neighbors, and they live through really an unimaginably difficult circumstance, and Cambridge is quite honestly the most well-resourced place I&#39;ve ever lived in. We&#39;ve got plenty of resources to be able to try and support these people, like these members of our community. Among other things, we recently voted down funding for the Transitional Wellness Center, and instead this is something that we want to give for basically just, yeah, enabling more policing of our neighbors we&#39;ve got we&#39;ve got things like heart we&#39;ve got community safety development and we should be working with these people instead of just the police department because our our solution should be extending a hand and trying to give resources to help people out and not just finding more ways to arrest them thank you so much thank you our next speaker is nino leet followed by lee ferris then heather hoffman nino</td>

                <td>Hello, Heather Hoffman, 213 Hurley Street. I&#39;d like to start with the Bacall petition. We need to protect the greenness of our open spaces and stop aiding them excessively. With respect to the Biomed petition, I&#39;m just pretty much disgusted by the way all of the other stuff in East Cambridge didn&#39;t get a peak of opposition, and somehow this one is. With respect to the separation of church and state, I hope that you will do that where the Marisol petition is concerned. You can&#39;t seem to learn the lessons of Grendel&#39;s Den or the lessons of Fight Fiercely Harvard and everybody else that Tom Lehrer told all of us. And I&#39;m sorry that you can&#39;t. We deserve better from our city government. With respect to the open meeting law, once again, the city solicitor seems to be unaware of prior cases involving the city of Cambridge. In 2013, the open meeting law decision on a complaint brought by Tom Solman, was that the city was engaging in serial deliberations. And I think that at the very least, you should have the city solicitor&#39;s opinion on how that applies to what&#39;s before you now. Thank you.</td>

                <td> Peter Crawley. I wanted to address the Council from the perspective of the East Cambridge Coalition that worked on the biomed upzoning at 320 Charles Street. First, I wanted to thank the Council for working through nights and weekends on a compromise, and I applaud them for being sensitive to a broad coalition of constituents, and I think we did get to a good place, so we appreciate that. I also wanted to point out some takeaways from the process that I hope will be helpful to the city going forward. One is, I think we have a definition problem here because community benefits are thought to encompass also mitigation development impact mitigation payments and I think that these two are different things and I&#39;m not um advocating that the funds from contract zoning go one place or another but we have to admit that historically they have gone primarily to mitigate impacts in the neighborhoods where the developments occurred whether it&#39;s a substation or moving a gas transfer or you know buying land on the grand junction So the fact that this project was accused of going outside that protocol, I think is a little unfair. And I would just ask people to actually respect that East Cambridge did the best job they could through this process. And we think it&#39;s a win for the whole city. So thank you.</td>

I know from the past that when I was on the council, there was a general consensus. Members wanted to help nonprofits. You can hear it tonight. people asking for it, and I know how you feel. So the future, which is what excited me about trying to help East End House get going, to build a community center, not to take money and put it in their pockets. So you have to think about, I know you know this, but I&#39;m gonna say it publicly, how to direct community benefit money, how to direct mitigation funds. They are separate. You can make it one if you wish, but they are separate. But more importantly, you can now use the budget. I realize we&#39;re going through a downside on budget money with offices not being occupied, but you can use funds that are non-real estate taxed So is it 300 million, 400 million? I&#39;m not suggesting it&#39;s that amount of money. Even if you make it one start out of 1% of that, that&#39;s three to four million a year into community benefits. And it will grow just like we all helped affordable housing grow. So not touching the budget even if it&#39;s delayed given the terrible budget times we are a wealthy city we need to help those who help our people thank you all thank you thank you madam mayor that is all that we&#39;re signed up to speak thank you mr stefan this complete completes public comment what is the pleasure of the city council</td>

                <td> Thank you, Mayor Simmons. Very appreciative through you to the staff. I recognize that we have, due to the extraordinary circumstances which we find ourselves in vis-a-vis the federal government, have put an ever-increasing burden on city staff across the board. Anxiety throughout the city, and in particular, given this communication, time spent on a myriad of legal cases related to the government. So I want to very much appreciate that this is, unfortunately, it&#39;s not unprecedented time. It&#39;s actually precedented because we&#39;re finding ourselves in this practically every week. This is a list of all the lawsuits challenging federal actions. I just wanted to follow up on a couple of them. There&#39;s some in which we have filed. We&#39;re either plaintiffs or have joined a brief. There&#39;s others that... For instance, one I&#39;m particularly grateful for that we do intend to file an amicus brief in the case, particularly for Harvard, contesting the federal government revocation of ability to enroll foreign students. This will have a direct and immediate impact on the city if this goes through. I&#39;m curious, is there any timing issues involved in filing these? And the other questions related to this, so there&#39;s a couple cases listed. Where we are not plaintiffs, there&#39;s one the city of Boston is, the city&#39;s Chelsea and Somerville. I understand that some of the court cases come down that when a jurisdiction is not part of the case, then it may not apply to them. So are we reviewing any of these cases to ensure that those that we are not party to that we maybe should be joining in order to ensure that any injunctive relief or any relief that&#39;s granted will be applied to the city of Cambridge so that we can protect both our finances, our ability to survive as a city, and also the residents across the city. If that makes sense is a question I&#39;d be interested in hearing from from the city staff. But once again, I know this has been quite challenging. If anyone hasn&#39;t had a chance to review the list, I know in addition to the lengthy ways in which we&#39;ll see later in the meeting of the city has been working, that this has created an extra challenge. And I very much appreciate everyone working overtime on it.</td>

Really we wanted to cover two things. One was the budget reconciliation bill that passed on July 4th and then was an update on the major court cases which we&#39;ve provided a summary of in the lawsuit tracker that was submitted with the agenda and we&#39;ll continue to provide those regular updates as we move forward. The budget reconciliation bill that passed on July 4th included many big and small changes. The largest were an extension of tax cuts, raising the debt ceiling, increasing funding for defense and immigration enforcement, increasing the endowment tax on universities, phasing out clean energy tax credits, and implementing major cuts to Medicaid and SNAP benefits. We are deeply concerned with so many of these policies, but in particular our starting conversations about how we start to prepare for changes in Medicaid and SNAP benefits. Much of the cuts are meant to be implemented through work requirements that make it more administratively burdensome for eligible households to stay covered. These policies have been tried, in particular in Arkansas in 2018, and it&#39;s been shown that there&#39;s a real impact on loss of coverage among people who are actually eligible, who are working. This creates strains on the medical system, on individuals and their families, and really has shown very little measurable impact on employment or hours worked. The changes to Medicaid work requirements are going to be rolled out through CMS and also through state Medicaid agencies. These are meant to take effect in early 2027, and so there will be much time for both development of rules and also new systems and processes. SNAP benefit work requirements don&#39;t have a specified timeline that we&#39;re aware of at this time, and it&#39;s really up to HHS and other federal agencies to develop and implement those new rules, but those could happen much more quickly. We can provide more detailed updates as we move forward. We are still waiting to understand the specific rules that will be rolled out, but I think we all recognize that there is an important role for the city. human service and public health programs, nonprofits, and community groups to work together to ensure that our residents are aware of the changes that will come, how to stay eligible, and that they&#39;re supported throughout this process of redeterminations. We&#39;ll also work to advocate with the state for more simplified and streamlined enrollment and re-enrollment processes, and with other municipalities on how we coordinate awareness, education, and engagement. We&#39;ve started reaching out through Metro Mayors to set up some meetings And certainly as we move into the fall and the new year, we&#39;ll keep the council updated and are looking forward to working with many of the community organizations that are already doing this work, getting their feedback and input and trying to make sure that we can bring that to conversations with the state. But just wanted to flag that that&#39;s one of the biggest impacts that we can see that we&#39;ll roll out over the next year. And we&#39;re very much tracking it and trying to start thinking through what we can do. So I think that was the update in terms of major legislation. And then we&#39;ll turn it over to the law department to give an update on some of the major cases and what we&#39;ve been seeing.</td>

                <td> THANK YOU, THROUGH YOU, MADAM MAYOR. SO FIRST I&#39;LL ADDRESS SOME OF COUNSELOR NOLAN&#39;S QUESTION, AND THEN THERE ARE A FEW OF THE CASES ON TODAY&#39;S TRACKER THAT DEPUTY CITY SOLICITOR VELOSO AND I WILL GIVE SOME HIGHLIGHTS ABOUT. SO FIRST OF ALL, WE ACTUALLY cut back somewhat on the number of cases that we have before you today on this litigation tracker, because there&#39;s so many across the country, and we wanted to make sure we&#39;re really bringing your attention to what we think You know are the at this time the most relevant to the city of Cambridge either because the city is actively participating in them or because our our neighbors Here in the Commonwealth are participating in them or because they directly impact what we&#39;re doing in the city And so this will change over time as the cases progress and COUNSELOR NOLAN WAS CORRECT WHEN SHE COMMENTED THAT WE NOW HAVE A DECISION FROM THE SUPREME COURT THAT INJUNCTIONS CAN&#39;T APPLY ACROSS THE BOARD TO EVERYONE IN A SIMILAR POSITION. YOU HAVE TO ACTUALLY BE A PARTY TO LITIGATION TO GET THE RELIEF THAT THE COURT IS GIVING. SO IT HAS BEEN REALLY IMPORTANT for us to be following what&#39;s happening and making sure that we are involved in litigation that would have a direct impact on the city. We&#39;ve been fortunate to have some really good partners in this. We&#39;ve been working with the Public Rights Project, which is a national organization that is supporting municipalities. really helping us all organize and join together in this litigation. We also, in the law department, have been working closely with law departments in other communities in Massachusetts and then also other communities across the country through both the Massachusetts Municipal Lawyers Association and the International Municipal Lawyers Association. And so it&#39;s been very helpful to be part of these very collaborative and helpful groups that are helping municipalities organize and get together and do this work. There may be cases that some of our neighbors, such as Boston, are in that we are not participating in because we have different grants available or somewhat different situations. But everywhere where Cambridge is being impacted, we are trying to engage and be part of litigation. I&#39;ll just jump out of order to answer your question about the presidents and fellows of Harvard versus Department of Homeland Security case. We are working with an outside law firm with the intent of filing an amicus brief in that case when it&#39;s already before the First Circuit, but when briefs are due. So we are expecting that that should be approximately the beginning of October. The federal government, the Department of Homeland Security, appealed that decision. Their brief is due August 25th. And then Harvard has 30 days to file their brief. And then any amicus briefs have an additional week after that. So that puts us around October 1st. So I&#39;ll now turn it over to Deputy City Solicitor Veloso and we&#39;ll just, between the two of us, cover a couple of other cases we wanted to update you on.</td>

                <td> Thank you. Thank you, Madam Mayor. The first case, the next case that we will update you on is King County v. Turner. This is a case in which plaintiff municipalities and regional transportation outlets, of which the city of Cambridge is also a plaintiff, sued the Secretary of Transportation and HUD for imposing conditions on grants to local governments, including HUD Continuum of Care grants and Department of Transportation grants. The conditions that the federal government have attempted to impose on these grants include restrictions on DEI, what the federal government refers to as gender ideology, elective abortions, and aid to immigrant groups. These imposed conditions threaten over $4 billion in federal funding. The plaintiffs have argued that the imposing of these conditions violate various federal laws and constitutional provisions. Current status is that a preliminary injunction has been granted in favor of the plaintiffs and the local governments on June 3rd, 2025. The preliminary injunction that was granted has allowed the city to enter into grant agreements with HUD for the continuum of care grants, which the city has done so. The federal government has appealed and the appeal is pending. Additionally, plaintiffs have filed a second motion for preliminary injunction and has also filed an amended complaint to add additional claims against the federal government to ask for protection of other grants. um the court has not issued a decision yet but it has scheduled accelerated briefing on the new preliminary injunction motion briefs will be due august 6 2025. No hearings have been scheduled on the preliminary injunction motions. However, the court need not grant hearings before rendering a decision, so it is up to the court to determine whether hearings will be scheduled on this updated preliminary injunction.</td>

                <td> through you madam mayor i&#39;ll just add to that that um the we have since we got the first order in that case uh received our materials we have to submit to hud on the cdbg grants and a few other hud grants so Our real interest now in the second preliminary injunction is to not have to agree to those conditions in order to get the CDBG grants and a few other HUD grants. The next case that I&#39;ll mention is the San Francisco versus Trump case. So this case was originally filed challenging the first sanctuary jurisdiction executive order that President Trump had issued. Subsequent to that case, there was the second sanctuary jurisdiction order, and then there was, Remember, there was the list of sanctuary jurisdictions that was up for a few days, and it did include Cambridge. So we are now part of a group of additional communities that are asking the court to allow us to join the case. So a new complaint that would add Cambridge and some other municipalities as plaintiffs in this case. so that we would be part of challenging these two executive orders and challenging their enforcement against the city. And there&#39;s a hearing later this week, August 6th, on whether the court will allow the complaint to be amended to add the new parties. And then the parties will be seeking a new preliminary injunction to say that there is an imminent threat that the federal government would enforce those executive orders and they should be stopped from enforcing those executive orders while the communities challenge those orders. I&#39;ll turn it back over to Elliot.</td>

                <td>The next case is State of New York v. U.S. Department of Justice. The states in this case of which Massachusetts is also a plaintiff are challenging the revocation of various exemptions under what&#39;s known as the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996. or PRORAR is part of the federal welfare system and it governs the eligibility of non-citizens to receive federal, state, and local public benefits. Several federal agencies have recently just issued new requirements that require recipients of federal funding to be checked for their immigration status. And these conditions also now apply to states and their instrumentalities. Administering federal benefit programs are now also required to implement verification schemes to verify the status of recipients to any public benefits, even if those programs previously did not require the states to check immigration status for recipients. In terms of current status, the federal government has agreed to pause enforcing these new rules against the plaintiff states and their subdivisions. Again, since Massachusetts is a plaintiff, whatever decisions are rendered in this case will apply to Cambridge and all other municipalities in the Commonwealth. The plaintiff states in this case have filed for a motion for a preliminary injunction. And we have recently received notice that HHS has agreed to stay enforcement of these PORAR conditions through September 10th, 2025. Now, HHS has stated that this period will permit the agency to, quote, consider as appropriate whether to provide additional info about HHS&#39;s notice requirements. Again, that is their official statement as to why they are pausing. So, that is current status on that case.</td>

                <td> Through you, Madam Mayor. And just to sort of break down what that all means is that there are some grants that the city receives where we&#39;ve been able to provide services and programs without having to, without regard to anyone&#39;s immigration status. You know, the city&#39;s been able to make services or programs available to everyone. And this could... ADD A REQUIREMENT ON THE CITY TO CHECK IMMIGRATION STATUS AND ONLY PROVIDE SERVICES OR PROGRAMS TO THOSE WITH A CERTAIN STATUS. AND I THINK THE NUMBER OF GRANTS THE CITY RECEIVES THAT WILL BE SUBJECT TO THIS WILL BE ON THE SMALLER END. BUT IN SOME COMMUNITIES THAT RECEIVE A LOT OF THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES FUNDING It&#39;s asking, when someone is in an emergency situation, for the local government to say, hold on, I can&#39;t help you until I&#39;ve checked your status. So it&#39;s a difficult process. and it&#39;s a change from what the practice has been of the federal government. So finally, I just wanted to really briefly mention one additional case, United States versus Illinois, Cook County, and Chicago. And I wanted to mention that because that was a case where the federal government brought, through the DOJ, brought a case against Illinois and Chicago and Cook County challenging some of their sanctuary policies. And in Chicago, it&#39;s specifically a welcoming community ordinance, very similar to Cambridge&#39;s, that has language about City employees not asking about immigration status before providing services to residents and the city not complying with federal detainers and the court recently upheld the sanctuary policies in that case and found them that it the federal government was overreaching they cannot commandeer the local government and upheld the sanctuary the Welcoming Community Ordinance. So as we have later on the agenda this evening, the Welcoming Community Ordinance here in Cambridge, I did want to highlight that case. And I think that&#39;s it for now, unless there are any questions. Councilman Nolan.</td>

This particular change may make it worse. Some of it doesn&#39;t, as noted, take effect until 2027, which is conveniently enough in times like this. of politics which would mean that the repercussions of it may not be fully felt until 2027 and yet it will be started in 2025 and 2026 so if there&#39;s anything else to add in terms of the specific particularly on health care or others otherwise if the city manager is done i yield council nolan yields the floor council wilson do you want to be heard on city manager&#39;s agenda number one</td>

I think we have representatives from CDD that can talk more about the project for this year. But it was really based on one, showing that nexus with casino-related impacts and what was able to be implemented.

I mean, we&#39;re very blessed because we have a whole range of funding, but sometimes it is, well, we have participatory budget for this, we have gaming commission for this, we have the regular budget for this, and then we have some other funds for this. While I appreciate this, a little more detail would be good, exactly how it will be spent, and also understanding the process. Because unlike some of our grants where it&#39;s $5,000 we&#39;re appropriating and accepting, $700,000 is a fair amount of money that will and could dramatically, especially given what we heard in public comment and what we&#39;ll be discussing later, it could really dramatically affect certain, for instance, nonprofits across the city.

So, again, just emphasizing that. You know, again, what&#39;s sticking out like a sore thumb, like Vice Mayor said, is the commercial districts and special events support of 25,000 versus, you know, these other numbers, which are so much far greater. And so I want to appreciate these dollars coming in from the Gaming Commission and also would like to see it be more equitably distributed. And so I want to appreciate the departments and department heads who obviously did the work. but look forward to getting something more in writing. So I don&#39;t know.

I would have to ask, uh, director Jennings. The other thing that you can do, uh, at any time, economic development could take this up into committee and talk about the process. The questions, uh, questions like. Does it have to be something that is associated with grant gaming? I don&#39;t know, because we have a long agenda. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good time for us to talk about it this evening. So I would have to defer the city manager, but my initial thoughts would be departments are already looking for this money to come in their direction. They may have even spent a little of it. I can&#39;t say for sure. Rather than stop this from going forward, sort of... Let&#39;s look at going forward how we may, if we can, change this. Let me see if Director Jennings wants to speak any more to that. Director Jennings, anything else you&#39;d like to recommend? If we were to charter right this, this means nothing would happen until September. This money would be held in abeyance until September. And would that have a negative effect on these departments that are already expecting or anticipating these funds?</td>

Civilian flaggers are common in other states, but still pretty rare in Massachusetts, even though they&#39;ve been legal, I think, since Governor Deval Patrick signed legislation on this a couple decades ago. Boston is moving forward with this as well, so glad we&#39;re working on this and looking forward to seeing updates, but just wanted to to say thank you for the timely response on the policy order on this.

Yeah, the question is what seems to me, since part of what we wanna do is safety, we also talked about that this is an opportunity for some jobs for local people, that our police officers would have the opportunity to have these jobs. But since I routinely see officers from other cities around the state here, what I would hope we would be able to do, and I want to know if we can, and if so, if we will, that first is Cambridge police officers, secondly is any civilian flaggers. In other words, no police officers outside of Cambridge would have preference over any kind of civilian flagger.</td>

It sounds like we would be able to specify other than our police officers getting first Opportunity that after that we could then have Civilian flaggers before any other it I would hope that would be the default and that in pretty much every situation that would give it as much opportunity as possible to local people and local residents who would have this opportunity to do this instead of bringing people in from other cities in town, so I whatever we can do would be something I think we should look very seriously at, and never ever use other officers unless there was no, not only Cambridge police officer, but civilians. So that is my hope and expectation for this program, since that&#39;s part of why we started it, it&#39;s part of why this state authorized it, and it&#39;s part of why the council took some time, and all of our city staff has been working to implement it.

We never know exactly How much money, whether this year it happens to be exactly the same money as we got last year, but because we can&#39;t count on this, it doesn&#39;t get appropriated as part of the city budget. As you will see, I am frequently coming to city council meetings. because we as a department get a large number of grants. And so this is a grant we&#39;ve had for many years and this is an additional year of that. The grant covers partial costs for between Baby U and the Center for Families, both of which are run by the same office. We have about 18 staff. This funds a large portion of the, or some portion of the salary of about six of our staff, including a portion of the Cambridge Dads coordinator. You may remember this used to be funded through the health department, and when things changed, we took it over. We were partners with them. So this is a program that now we work we&#39;re the primary supporter of that program. And a major piece of that program, and you may see it advertised frequently on different city media, are we do dad&#39;s workshops, we do dad and child basketball, dad and child barbershop, dad and child events in general, meetups. And it is an effort to support dads and their, especially young children, but not only young children.</td>

It looks like we were gonna budget, we budgeted $11,100,000 for fiscal year 25. Let me know if I&#39;m mixed up about that, but we thought that money would go to upgrades for the Moses Youth Center, the First Street Garage, the City Hall Annex, and the Healey Public Safety Building. So I&#39;m just wondering, is the first street garage repair going to cost us much more than we had anticipated? And when we do use this construction manager at risk procurement construction method, are we getting several bids so we can make sure that we&#39;re staying on budget and we&#39;re getting the best deal?</td>

Um, so the first Greek garage is costing more than anticipated. Um, the focus when we first started scoping the project was really on, um, The staircase on the second street side, which people may remember during the renovations that were originally planned there, there was a collapse and there was a fatality on site. And so the scope at that point was really focused on replacing that staircase and then the elevator on that side. As we&#39;ve gotten into the building, it has become clear that there are significant other issues that need to be addressed in the garage. What we focused on is really, we&#39;ve called this a core life safety package. It&#39;s looking at that staircase on the second street side as well as the elevator. as well as the elevator on the first street side and some stair issues on that side. It&#39;s also looking at fire protection throughout the building and also drainage throughout the building because one of the things as we&#39;ve had more consultants really go in and looking at the building, there are significant issues with the drainage which is leading to significant deterioration within the building. And so what we&#39;ve really focused on here is looking at those sort of core life safety elements. And so We are looking at the appropriation that we did previously as well as supplementing it with deferred maintenance funds that we have identified through various years through the MFIP program. And so it&#39;ll be a complement of both of those funds. Council Zusy?</td>

So I think people were doing sort of basic maintenance and keeping the garage functioning and doing the sort of day-to-day operations but not looking at those sort of bigger capital maintenance needs. And so I think it is very much like the conversations we&#39;ve had about a number of city buildings and that sort of backlog of maintenance. In terms of the process, I&#39;d like to turn it over to Brendan. And Brendan, maybe you could talk a little bit about the sort of selection process and how that works, getting a contractor on board.</td>

                <td>Great. So through you, Madam Mayor, I mean, the construction manager at risk process obviously is something we&#39;ve done a whole bunch in the city the past couple of years. And one of the real benefits to it is being able to have the general contractor kind of come in towards the end of the design process or in the middle of the design process sometimes to kind of help identify unknowns. And so in an instance like this, where we have an existing building, an existing structure that might have some concerns with it, an architect can&#39;t always find all the issues right away. And when you go out to bid, they&#39;re only going to own what&#39;s on the drawings, what the architect could identify. And so by doing a see them at risk process, We can do a selection process to find the best contractor for us, looking at a bunch of different things. And then they become a team member from the start. And that allows us to go into the building, do a little bit more extensive investigation, find out what we need to do to make the building right. And that way we have a better understanding of what our costs are going to be. It&#39;s really about minimizing the unknown costs. We all fear change orders, none more so than myself. And so this is a way to identify the cost upfront and so we&#39;re better prepared for it. And then also just to mention, we do go through a process, the CMRS process, it&#39;s laid out there. We have an entire committee that&#39;s assigned to looking at the request for qualifications and interview process to select the best construction manager for us.</td>

Anyway, I&#39;m just surprised that again, in the budget book, we were anticipating paying $11.1 million to fix four buildings, and we&#39;re going to end up spending almost all of that on one building. So is there any competition for the job? I&#39;m just concerned because we&#39;re going to have less money going forward. So again, are we receiving multiple bids or are you only getting one bid?</td>

So all that all the value of that is they just assign a kind of a percentage that they&#39;ll charge. So there&#39;s really not a lot of money involved in the selection of the construction manager. Once they&#39;re part of the team in about three to four months, I don&#39;t want to say the exact date once the drawings are complete, then we&#39;ll go out to bid. The more bidders, the merrier. And hopefully we get many low bids and we get to choose one that works just perfect for us. But at this point, we&#39;re still just developing the scope of the drawings. And by having the construction manager, it just helps us identify it. So we don&#39;t actually have any bids coming in right now or anything like that. It&#39;ll still be another few months later. or yeah, a few months, but while we develop the drawings.</td>

                <td>Correct. So it&#39;s a combination through you, Madam Mayor, sorry. That budget that you see there is a combination of our in-house cost estimating as well as the estimate from the architect about a month or two ago with what they know. And that&#39;s one of the reasons that triggered us to say we should probably, it&#39;s advantageous to the city to use this construction manager at risk process once we cross the $5 million threshold that becomes allowable for us to do that. By having them come in, now we can actually define that budget a little bit better. So the 8.3 that you see in there, or 8.5 I think it is for actual construction costs, that will get redefined over the next few months. I mean, we think it&#39;s pretty close to that. I mean, we have a lot of backup for it, but it&#39;s better to be safe than sorry and have a second opinion from an actual construction manager. And then... And just to follow up on your other piece of your question that no one&#39;s competing for this money that we had for those projects. I mean, we have our budgets set aside and allotted for it. And the extra money that might be necessary for this comes out of our general MFIP fund that my department now has. And so we can weigh where it needs to go for projects like this that may need a couple extra dollars.</td>

So that was what we felt was not advisable from kind of the use of the park and the experience of the park for users.

While that moves forward, we&#39;ll be able to do the small amount of design work to add the Wesley Ave access point.

I also want to confirm and point out, I agree with Councillor Siddiqui on communicating this, because one of the most important parts of this memo, in my view, is, quote, no trees will be impacted or removed with the addition of a connection at Wesley Ave., that was a concern raised by many people in the neighborhood that this would be something that would negatively impact the trees so i just would would like that public confirmation that this has been assessed it&#39;s been there will be a beautiful path and connection connecting of this public street to this public park and that it will not be done in any way that will compromise the the trees that are in existence and it will be landscaped as per our um usual method is that just just wanted to confirm that and point that out and then i think for this memo itself just to be communicated and sent out to everybody who&#39;s written in the entire neighborhood makes sense. I think there&#39;s a list for this project for all of Linear Park to communicate this and make sure that&#39;s highlighted because it&#39;s very important. I know we all care about the tree canopy, and given that care has been taken to ensure that this new connection, which will allow more connectivity, will not affect the trees. That would be great. Thank you, Mayor Simmons.</td>

I think it&#39;ll be really helpful to everyone. And I&#39;m just, I know you&#39;ll be posting this on the website. I don&#39;t know where, but I think that it will be really helpful. helpful because it&#39;s hard to find places to meet. I know when I was the head of the Cambridge Port Neighborhood Association, we met many different places that aren&#39;t listed on the list yet. So I know this will grow. We would meet at Cambridge Housing Authority Spaces, which is like another category that we should add. So we would meet at Woodrow Wilson Court, we would meet at LBJ Apartments, And then actually there was a community room at the Corporal McTernan at the old Blessed Sacrament School where we would also meet. And even before then, we used to meet sometimes at churches. So I think the list of churches can be added. And don&#39;t forget Magazine Beach. That&#39;s not a city property, but it&#39;s in the city. And I can share information on how people can access and permit projects at Magazine Beach. I&#39;m really excited that you list so many gyms that I knew at the Moore School just down the street from me. There&#39;s often pickup basketball at the gym, and I see that that&#39;s the case at many, many other gyms. I just wondered, who pays for that? Does the recreation department pay for that? Or do group-specific teams pay for the pickup games at the schools? Because I think we should be using our schools and those school gyms. Or you can let me know later. I don&#39;t mean to put you on the spot, but I am curious about that.</td>

It was a group of seniors that wanted to meet there. So again, I think when we can it&#39;s good to make our already existing municipal spaces available to residents to meet we don&#39;t have to build buildings we have the buildings so I know staffing is an issue but I feel like all we have to do is pay for staff and we don&#39;t have to build a new building and we encourage community encourage exercise encourage people gathering which is a really really significant thing so thank you I yield.</td>

I will note that having rewritten the policy on school use of spaces I&#39;m the all of those spaces are available but it&#39;s for rented and we have different categories there&#39;s if you&#39;re a Cambridge group if you&#39;re a youth group if you&#39;re a city group if you&#39;re Cambridge residents but not a youth group and also if you&#39;re just outside Cambridge the school department has a very robust policy of trying to allow folks to use it but also to cover the cost because it can be quite expensive to to lend these out and you pay a different rate if you&#39;re a non-profit or not a non-profit so um what one could do uh through you mayor simmons to counselors is you can look up that rate on the school committee website and you will have your questions answered so thanks for putting this together and look forward to helping you update it council nolan yields the floor anyone else want to be heard on city manager&#39;s agenda item number 19. council wilson</td>

Relative to awaiting report item number 25-36, regarding a further response to the request that the exception language in chapter 2.129.040 Section J of the Cambridge Municipal Code be revised with language clarifying that Cambridge City employees shall not participate in federal immigration enforcement operations and that the sole role of Cambridge City employees during an action by ICE is only to protect public safety and not to assist or facilitate the work of ICE.

We passed the original welcoming community ordinance before the current federal administration and the actions that we&#39;ve seen in places, including in Massachusetts, next door in Somerville and nearby in Worcester with masked individuals claiming to be federal agents abducting folks off the street. This ordinance updates our recognition that we need to meet the moment and also that Cambridge is not going to back down or make a deal with the Trump administration and weaken our protections. In fact, we&#39;re gonna bolster them. As we heard in public comment, this would make our welcoming community ordinance the strongest in the Commonwealth, which I think we should be proud of. These updates do two things. They make clear that CPDs only focuses on public safety, not assisting ICE in any federal action, and also require that in any action, including with masked individuals, that city employees work to verify and document activity on the scene, that these actually are federal agents, and that they&#39;re intervening as much as possible on behalf of uh a residence um so i&#39;ll yield there in case um you know other counselors have questions or remarks um but then i did have some motions to ordain this and uh you know looking forward to this taking effect as soon as possible um but i&#39;ll yield for now council sabrina wheel yields the floor is this further discussion on item number 22. council known</td>

And to remind people we are doing everything we can to protect our city residents. And there are some things we cannot do that we wish we could do, but federal law prevents us from doing it. So as much as we&#39;d like to perhaps do additional things and What we&#39;re doing is something that&#39;s very responsible and also very clear that we are standing up, as Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler said, and I think all the city staff agree that we&#39;re moving forward with a strong ordinance to ensure that our safety is protected.

I did think it would be important for us to communicate the answer to a question that through you, Mayor Simmons, I think to city staff, city manager, city solicitor. that there was some question and reference made to the Dover Amendment. This is really, in my understanding, this is not related to that. This is because the federal law, RLUPA, is something that we will have to follow no matter what. This is only about that. The Dover Amendment is a separate discussion, which we can have another day. But just to let people know, it&#39;s not that... We have frankly messed up on that. This is something that we are doing in order to ensure a compliance with the RELUPA, which stands for the religious use. And there was some concern that, well, why are you doing this? Let&#39;s just do a case by case instead of allowing the use explicitly. And in my view, the reason to do this overall is because if we did a case by case, it would burden the staff. It would burden anyone coming forward with a case. It would mean every single time there was a religious use expected that we would have to go through an entire process. And in the end, we would have to grant it because of the federal law. So I just wanted to confirm that that&#39;s our understanding through you from the city solicitor that that is why this would be a better way to approach this, which is what is the petition before us. Madam Solicitor.</td>

                <td>Thank you. Through you, Madam Mayor. To Councilor Nolan, correct, this does not relate to the Dover Amendment, although that is a separate type of protection that a religious use could avail itself of. This does relate to the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act, which is a federal law. And just To clarify a point that you said, IF THERE WAS A CASE BY CASE ANALYSIS DONE FOR EVERY EXPANSION BY RELIGIOUS USE, IT ISN&#39;T AUTOMATIC THAT THE PERMITTING BOARD OR ISD WOULD HAVE TO ALLOW IT. THEY WOULD HAVE TO DO THAT CASE BY CASE ANALYSIS AND EACH APPLICATION IS UNIQUE AND YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THE ANALYSIS OF whether there&#39;s a burden to their religious use, whether there&#39;s a compelling governmental interest and whether the least restrictive, what&#39;s being imposed, the zoning requirement is the least restrictive way of imposing that governmental interest. So it&#39;s not an automatic that every application would be allowed But by if the council chooses to enact this amendment to the ordinance There are at least any application That&#39;s looking for the additional size and height Would THAT WOULD HAVE HAD THE ARGUMENT THAT THERE ISN&#39;T A COMPELLING GOVERNMENT INTEREST BECAUSE WE&#39;VE ALLOWED THIS SIZE AND HEIGHT FOR RESIDENTIAL. I&#39;M NOT ARTICULATING IT THAT WELL AT THIS HOUR IN THIS WARM CHAMBER, BUT IT&#39;S NOT THAT EVERY PROJECT WOULD BE ALLOWED ABSENT THIS, BUT THIS WOULD there would be a number of projects that could have been allowed absent this because of what we allow for residential size and this zoning amendment would allow them without having to apply and go through the case by case analysis.</td>

                <td> Yeah, thank you. That&#39;s why I&#39;m supporting this, because I do think, based on everything we&#39;ve seen, this is not allowing any religious use to go beyond what we already allow in our ordinance for housing. It&#39;s carte blanche for anything you can do. It really is limited to what is already existing in it. in the zoning that we passed. So I&#39;m happy to move this forward. I think it expires if we don&#39;t. This is maybe a second reading in ordainment tonight. So happy to support and I just wanted to clarify for folks that this is why it is that the council has decided to take this step.</td>

I believe there&#39;s an updated amendment. Update where we are as of tonight because much has changed. Sounds good. Thank you, Vice Mayor. I know there&#39;s been... A lot of discussions and work. I really appreciate the work of the city council over the last weeks. And in particular, I think Vice Member Govern for leading a lot of the back and forth. I know that in the June 30th, conversation there was really a desire from the council to try and find a way for us to move forward ideally with folks feeling like we were listening to a lot of the different voices that were being expressed recognizing that there was a process that got us here and there was also a lot of feedback that came out while we were coming closer to the end I think in many ways appreciated the public comment tonight and also felt like it in many ways reflected that the conversations that have been had are getting us to that point where we are in a better place than we were a couple of weeks ago. And I think that&#39;s reflected in the commitment letter that Biomed has submitted to the city. I think in regards to the vice mayors, I&#39;m speaking like prior deputy city manager Owen O&#39;Riordan. I feel like he&#39;s rubbed off a little bit. But in regards to some of the work that&#39;s happening that will continue to happen, we have a letter of commitment from Biomed tonight that&#39;s been shared with the council and has been posted. That reflects Biomed&#39;s commitment to community benefits, community mitigation as part of the zoning that is on the table. That really lays out the money that&#39;s coming in for which purposes and the timeline as well as some appropriate conditions on that. In addition, the city has been in discussions with East End House regarding an agreement, a memorandum of agreement between the city and East End House over how the East End House benefit dollars will be distributed. I think those discussions have been going productively. We feel like on both sides, there&#39;s trust that we have line of sight. On terms of those agreements, it&#39;s not finalized yet, but I think we feel like we&#39;re going to get that done over the coming weeks. That is not a holdup for the vote tonight. I think we can vote the zoning and accept the letter of commitment from Biomed, and there&#39;s a commitment from the city to continue working with these in-house. We&#39;re going to get to an agreement, and I think those terms and conditions will be acceptable to both sides. So I think those are the main updates. Maybe I&#39;ll turn it over to the city solicitor just for some additional comments. And then happy also if Assistant City Manager of CDD, Melissa Peters, has some final thoughts as well. Madam Solicitor.</td>

Through you, Madam Mayor, just procedurally, I want to make sure the council and the public is aware that during the course of this meeting earlier this evening, Biomed did submit a slightly revised letter of commitment. And so that was shared with the counselors and copies were made available to the public here tonight. And now it&#39;s being put up on the screen. So if you could scroll down a little bit, Naomi, to Thank you. So what this change that BioMed put into the letter tonight, it doesn&#39;t change the amount of funds that they&#39;ve committed to providing or how those funds are dispersed. What it does, though, is there&#39;s an initial payment that&#39;s made 60 days after the zoning is passed. And then a second payment that&#39;s made after the special permit has been approved, but BioMed has put in a further requirement or condition term, I guess, that if they don&#39;t apply for a special permit within the first 12 months, that second payment would still be paid on the anniversary of the first payment. even without waiting for special permit approval. So this doesn&#39;t change what any of the recipients are receiving. It&#39;s just, in fact, ensures that they get the payments according to the schedule, even if Biomed decides not to move forward with the special permit within the first year. So that is now... in the signed commitments made by Biomed that they are offering that are incorporated by reference into the zoning text if it passes. Thanks.</td>

But if they get denied and cannot do the project, then, which makes, would make sense. Because if they can&#39;t do the project, then the whole thing falls, falls apart, right? Okay. Through you, Madam Mayor, I too want, so, yeah, this has been a long, a long few weeks. You know, but I do want to point out too that, that This is not unusual, right? This is kind of how the process often goes, where there are meetings that get held within a community, within a neighborhood. And then that comes before the council, which then opens that conversation up. to a lot of people who may not have been involved in the neighborhood conversations. And then it&#39;s our job as policymakers and the governing body to then ask questions and make revisions and do things that and make amendments. I mean, we do this kind of thing all the time. So for the folks who are concerned that this is somehow We are operating differently. We&#39;re not operating differently. Most of these zoning petitions and agreements don&#39;t come out the way they go in, and that happens all the time. I do really want to thank a number of people. The East Cambridge Neighborhood Coalition, which was the group that engaged with Biomed for several months to sort of get this agreement on the table. We&#39;ve had a lot of discussions with them over the last week or two, and I do want to appreciate their willingness to compromise and move off of their initial stance to reach, I think, an agreement that may not be everything that everybody wanted, but everyone is coming out of this process in a better place than where they were before. And I think that that is a positive thing. I want to thank the East End House also for their work. I want to thank the nonprofit coalition and the nonprofits who took part in this conversation. I think, as you heard tonight, there was a lot of talk about how do we figure out a way forward where the Community Benefits Fund and how we can strengthen the entire network of our nonprofits. Because the reality is that our nonprofits cross neighborhood lines all over the city. And there are nonprofits in West Cambridge that are serving East Cambridge kids. the East End House that&#39;s serving West Cambridge kids, and that we are a small city. And so thinking of the network is really important. And there was a policy order that we passed a few weeks ago, sponsored by myself, Councilor Siddiqui, Councilor Wilson, and I believe maybe the mayor, that we&#39;re going to look into the community benefits fund and take a look at that and reevaluate that and see how we can move forward to kind of Make improvements. And so we are committed to that and we will be doing that. I want to thank Biomed. Obviously, I&#39;ve said several times that not just on this project, but in general, really every project that I&#39;ve worked with Biomed on and we&#39;ve worked with Biomed on, they set the standard, I think, for commercial developers in the city. reach out to the community. They listen to the community. They make changes based on the community. They follow through with the promises they make with the community. And really, they have built up, at least with me, a great deal of trust because they&#39;ve earned it. And so I really want to thank them. And I want to thank my Councilor Siddiqui, Councilor Wilson, and the Mayor, who, along with myself, worked really hard to try and find a way that we could honor and respect the work that was done by the East Cambridge Neighborhood Coalition, and that East Endhouse would walk away with a sizable contribution, but that we would also respect the concerns raised by the other nonprofits. And I think we did that, and we were able to do that because people were willing to compromise and work together and talk to each other. I really appreciate all of that. And so just so folks are maybe who didn&#39;t read it or are Just listening, let me just sort of summarize the financial sort of allocation that we&#39;re voting on tonight. So the total funds that Biomed was committing to the community benefits package in terms of nonprofits was $21,800,770. That was originally going to the East End House at one of our previous meetings, I think it was May 30th. We allocated 1.7 million of that to four other non-profits, which brought the East End House, it was a little more than that. We brought the East End House allocation to 20 million, and then now what is in front of us is another sort of agreement or set of numbers. at the end of the day if this passes the east end house will receive sixteen million seven hundred and fifty thousand seven hundred and seventy dollars the community benefits fund will receive three million two hundred and forty nine $249,230. The East Cambridge Scholarship Fund will receive $50,000. CEOC Rise Up Program will receive $500,000. The Cambridge Community Center will receive $416,923.33. The Cambridge Community Arts Center will receive the same $416,923. and the dance complex will receive $416,923.23. So again, I know that I appreciate that the East Cambridge folks who were hoping initially for 21,000,008 were able to work and get, and that number is now 16,75. And then obviously I appreciate all the other nonprofits who were hoping for more money to go to the Community Benefits Fund, but also were able to work collaboratively and get to the point where we are today. So I really hope that this passes. This is a very good project, I think. regardless of the funding that&#39;s going to all of these nonprofits, I think the building itself is a vast improvement over the building that&#39;s there now. It&#39;s going to create more green space. It&#39;s going to be a much better looking building for the community. So I think we&#39;ve landed, although it was a lot of work and stressful, I think we landed in a place where everybody&#39;s walking away better off. And that&#39;s ultimately what I think people want most. So I will yield at that point, Madam Mayor. I thank you and I thank everybody for their work on this.</td>

                <td>Yes. Thank you, Madam Mayor. Just to follow up on what the Vice Mayor said, I too want to thank members of our community for speaking out to our nonprofits. The Biomed, you know, this is I just wanna say thank you. I think this has been good governance, really, where we could recognize a challenge or even maybe a feeling around injustice or inequity. and be able to act upon it, especially within our role as counselors. I recognize where we were on May 20th and really respect where we are today as August 4th in the countless number of hours. of meetings that went into this on all sides of the conversation. This was important for us to be able to elevate it to this level in order to kind of get us to where we are today. And for the Community Benefits Fund to see over $3 million be distributed to that fund is also hasn&#39;t happened in quite some time. So the nonprofits that are going to be able to benefit from those dollars will be a beautiful thing, especially in these times of uncertainty and these times of challenge, of dire needs that many of our nonprofits are experiencing. I do want to appreciate heavily this process because what it has opened our eyes to are the flaws within a system, the flaws within not only just the, you know, people&#39;s feelings around the community benefits fund and the needs around making it a more robust, more equitable resource for our nonprofits to be able to take advantage of. But I think respectfully, this allows us to be mindful of when we are engaging with developers who are doing work in our city, that we are using those dollars and probably distributing them into this fund in a way that can be beneficial to many of our nonprofits across the sector. Again, I want to thank my colleagues on the council who stayed up with me, early morning meetings, late night meetings, weekend meetings, et cetera, on this. But the many of people who we engaged with throughout this process from East Cambridge to other nonprofits across the sector, excuse me, across the sector, y&#39;all put in a lot of work and you all should be proud of yourselves for getting to this point. While I know it&#39;s not 100% happiness on one side or the other, I think what we need to be happy with is a process, that we were able to engage folks in a process and get to a place where we can say, we&#39;re here, folks all agree, and we&#39;re able to move this forward. Again, I want to say thank you to Biomed, to Sal, and others from his team on this work. REALLY I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING MORE DOLLARS COME INTO THE CITY AND I LOOK FORWARD TO AS CO-CHAIR OF HUMAN SERVICES TO BE ABLE TO TALK MORE ABOUT THE COMMUNITY BENEFITS FUND AND HOW WE CAN DO A BETTER JOB OF MAKING SURE THAT THESE DOLLARS THAT WE ARE ACTUALLY INVESTING IN THIS FUND AND UTILIZING THESE DOLLARS TO MAKE OUR NONPROFIT SECTOR EVEN MORE ROBUST. THANK YOU. AYEU.</td>

I think there&#39;s a lot to learn and I think you know i think some of my colleagues you know feel you know they could have voted last month i do think though that it&#39;s important to reflect on intent versus impact and the fact that around how we make decisions and what we do is really important and I do think that there has to be improvement on that and I think there is a shared commitment from the council as we move forward with updating the ordinance, having those conversations, you know, and thinking about the moment that we&#39;re in. The moment&#39;s different from five years ago, right? Or even ten years ago. Right now, with the challenges nonprofits are facing and what&#39;s up ahead, there is a lot more need. And so how we do things and allocate money through these processes is really important and so I think we will probably have more projects coming and so I want to really have that urgency to think about and have those conversations as we get those updates to the ordinance and hear from the Community Benefits Advisory Committee on some of, you know, what&#39;s worked and what hasn&#39;t worked. I know that Chair Wilson will be having, and Vice Mayor McGovern will have meetings on this in the fall, but I do think there&#39;s an urgency there. So there was a lot of, there were a lot of meetings here, there was a lot of back and forth. I think you know, things could have been done differently. And, you know, I take my own responsibility in that. And I think, you know, I think we&#39;ve landed in a place where I think most people, you know, are in a, you know, are okay but as we heard in public comment there&#39;s still so much more work to be done so i look forward to doing that and moving forward but not losing sight of the last few months thanks council sadiki yields the floor council tone our floor is yours thank you counselor uh</td>

                <td> Thank you, Madam Mayor. First, I just want to say I respect the efforts of the Vice Mayor, Council Siddiqui, you, Mayor Simmons, and Council Wilson, but I&#39;m going to be voting no on this. I attended a number of meetings and voted twice to support the original deal that was on the table. and people from East Cambridge thought that that&#39;s what they were getting, and many people only supported this project with BioMed because they thought this was going to support the East End House. This is no disrespect to the other non-profits in the city, but I didn&#39;t hear one complaint about this proposal from any of us until the week before we were going to vote on it. And then all of a sudden it became this discussion about we should chop this up and other people should get dollars. I live in North Cambridge. I wouldn&#39;t think for one second that people in North Cambridge should get any of the impact mitigation money based on what&#39;s going to happen in East Cambridge in this residential neighborhood. That&#39;s why I supported it. That&#39;s who came out and spoke in favor of it. I feel like there&#39;s been a lot of accusations about lack of transparency. Well, if that&#39;s true, the nine of us are guilty of it because we were part of those meetings for a year with Biomed and the East End House. And I believe the staff knew about these conversations. But again, a week before a vote comes down, all of a sudden, we&#39;re going to change what&#39;s being proposed. I&#39;m definitely filing a policy order for our meeting in September to have some clarity on this issue going forward about how we do this work. I&#39;ve only been on the council for three years, but I&#39;ve lived in the city for my entire life, and I&#39;ve seen many, many, many things built and developed where the conversation was limited to the abutters of the property. I live about 300 yards away from the W.R. Grace building, which is now IQ HQ. I just, because I live on the other side of Mass Ave, we weren&#39;t part of the list of people called to come to the meetings when they were discussing. Now, it turned out great. Nobody talked about it. I&#39;m not sure if any mitigation funds went to non-profits or not. I know they&#39;re doing good work in my neighborhood, and it&#39;s going to be a lovely project when it&#39;s done. But we need some real clarity about how this happens. There are a lot of, you know, I&#39;m not saying anybody here on this council said negative things, but there were a lot of negative things said about the process, lack of transparency, the East End House, the executive director of the East End House in this process, and that&#39;s very, very unfortunate. So going forward, I hope we can have a better process. I&#39;m not going to be voting for this. I may be the only one, but I just feel that I made a commitment a long time ago to support the original proposal. Thank you, Madam Mayor. I yield.</td>

I will say the other point of this is that I know as a council we&#39;ve struggled around how to fund nonprofits because of the anti-aid amendment. There was a conversation last term around the Cambridge Math Circle and all of that. And I think that this is not a bad model, in fact, of funding it through development. And I think this is done in some ways beforehand, but this specific way where all the benefits are going to nonprofits, I don&#39;t think is at least something that I&#39;ve seen before. So I thought that this was really interesting. And I think that, you know, to counselor&#39;s point, like, you know, like the positive aspect of that is that because the money did go to a local nonprofit first, the project was pretty popular. And so now we have all these nonprofits that are active and interested and want to get funding. And hopefully that&#39;ll lead us to some win-wins where, you know, I&#39;m sure Biomed will have a next project or Alexandria or someone else. And if they could get nonprofits on board and it feels like a win-win, hopefully it&#39;ll be something that the community can get behind going forward. So maybe there&#39;s like a silver lining here in terms of next steps.</td>

I would just say I think this was a really strange process after all the discussions we had and then a lot of changes at the last minute. It&#39;s just a strange piece. I&#39;ve been a part of a lot of development conversations, and usually it is about the development, right? And if that folks opposing that or supporting it. This was a case where everybody agreed that the development should move forward. But it was a sort of conversation between nonprofits about how the benefits funding was going to be allocated. And that was a really strange conversation to be having, I&#39;ll be honest. We hope we can improve the process going forward so we don&#39;t end up in this situation again, because it is just a tough piece to be having this conversation, not about the development itself, but about how to split funding between nonprofits and the community development funds, which are all things we want to support. I was really sympathetic to folks on all sides of this conversation. And that just made it really hard and a really challenging one. And I hope we can improve this process going forward. I think there&#39;s a lot more I could say about this, but, you know, grateful for the folks who spent all the time working this out and glad we were able to, you know, get something that I think is going to move forward with, you know, the vast majority of support, and we&#39;re not, like, having a contentious, you know, fight on the floor about this, so grateful for that, and looking forward to improving this process going forward.

                <td> Thank you, Mayor Simmons. I will just echo the thanks that have already been said, starting with the Vice Mayor of all of East Cambridge who came out, all of the nonprofits across the city, Biomed and Sal Zenoa sitting here in the audience and really good partners. The remarks are, I do hope we learn the lessons from this. There are many, many improvements we need to make in the process. We must do a better job at contract zoning mitigation. And with this case, what I saw was that after good faith negotiations, based on what the city requested, an agreement was reached. And then after the seeming consensus, some serious and valid concerns were expressed about how it unfolded. And to many, this agreement appeared to be counter to council stated values and past attempts to ensure development led to community-wide discussions. There was publicly available information about all these meetings, but many did not know about it, which contributed to ill will. And also, concerns ended up coming up relatively late in the process, which then created additional ill will. So it really is not Cambridge at its finest hour. And I think what was somewhat surprising and challenging for people in contributing to the concern is how many other recent projects with the community impact did not raise questions. So we&#39;ve had a lot of projects recently that didn&#39;t lead to contributions to the community benefits, which did start in I believe 2015. So we have the Foundry, we have Grand Junction from Alexandria, we have 40 Thorndike Street, Project by Leggett, we have IQHQ, which needed ComCom approval and committed to some community benefits, which was non-profit, Stancer, Counselor, Toner, many of the non-profits in that neighborhood, and they were all in the affected neighborhood of Ale Life. And very close to this one, Biomed spent tens of millions of dollars, which are astonishing and wonderful, on the 585 project with the theater and arts programming. And yet that did not spur a call to say, why not spread the wealth and have an art space and help the dance complex or Central Square Theater? So I think that&#39;s why this led to this real concern and frustration across the city, that it didn&#39;t seem like... Why this project all of a sudden on the other hand it did raise these questions And I think it&#39;s healthy that we&#39;re now asking them and I think that there&#39;s two key questions that stand out as begging for answers Who is selected for a community process when it&#39;s established? I don&#39;t know people asked me I Couldn&#39;t answer that question because that was part of the concern well this group got together But it was seated with people of just one ilk and not all the other nonprofits were at the table I do think we have to answer that question and know the answer to it and And then what&#39;s the difference between contract zoning and mitigation and a community benefits project? Is there a ratio, which I think was talked about in this one? When someone said, well, I said this is contract zoning mitigation. We&#39;ve done this a lot in the past. That&#39;s why it&#39;s all focused on East Cambridge. East Cone Bridge has borne more of the displacement due to this development. It makes sense that the development mitigation would be there, but then the question is, well, why isn&#39;t all of it a community benefits project? I think those key questions about how the community group gets established and what does it mean to have a community benefits and contract zoning are two of at least the first questions we should start with. I think we all, at least I would say, negotiation should be transparent. clear, equitable, and they should make sense. And that did not happen here. A lot of people felt one of those criteria were not met. So whatever we do as we fix this process, we really do need to, I think, commit to those goals. So I also spoke with a lot of people on this issue over the past few months and intensely in the last few weeks. And yet, I want to remind all of us, those of us who were not involved directly, we were very aware of open meeting law and could not have engaged directly with our colleagues on some of this. So that also creates some issues that I know a lot of us, many had way more hours than I did, but I also spent a lot of hours back and forth with people. But making sure that I was very aware that we wouldn&#39;t break open meeting law. And during that whole process, just like publicly, I was very consistent in stating, yes, the process was flawed and could be improved. And that to amend this agreement, given that it came out of a community group that had been established, that is the group that should be worked together on working on this. So I&#39;m really grateful and appreciate that some of my colleagues in that community group did come together and amended it. and address some of the concerns, not all of the concerns. But again, I really appreciate all those conversations that I was not part of that led to this. And the goal for me was to ensure as best a community process as could be had given the situation. So there are other projects that will happen, hopefully, in the future. Again, and I&#39;m also going to say, we should be grateful Biomed is even moving forward, because there&#39;s not a lot of development going on. And this is an astonishing amount of money that will be put to good use over the next few years. And any developer mitigation funds, whether it&#39;s an East Cambridge or an Alewife, should be considered for investments in other areas of the city. But again, let&#39;s have a transparent, comprehensive process that we understand how it is that those get adjudicated. So I will be supporting this. I was supportive of the original. It came out of a community group. This also came from the community group after a lot of back and forth and work from my colleagues on this, which again, I appreciate and I know that if we&#39;re all committed to doing this better in the future, then we&#39;ll be able to not have these conversations, every single one. And just remember though, vice mayor said many of these projects that&#39;s what happens it gets messy at the end but this is how it does unfold there&#39;s been a number of projects where this kind of of work happens so i will again be supporting this and i look forward to moving forward and celebrating that new building council nolan deals the floor council lucy floors yours</td>

                <td> Well, let&#39;s hope they get their building permits and other discretionary permits so that they can count on the funding as they plan for their capital campaign. I will be supporting this tonight, and I really commend the East Cambridge Neighborhood Coalition and Biomed Realty. their very public community process and I&#39;m very grateful that they and the nonprofit coalition have come to an understanding about community benefits I agree with counselor Nolan I think we really have to understand better so when are we providing development mitigation funds, and when are we providing community benefits? And not all community benefits will go to nonprofits, because I know when we were talking about Porter Square and upzoning there, we were talking about how parking and open space may be community benefits that we really seek. So it&#39;s a broader world, the world of community benefits. I hope, I mean, one of the reasons that I was convinced that or felt strongly that the East End House really should get the majority of the funds was because they are this legacy service provider, primary provider in East Cambridge. that has a home that&#39;s falling apart and they really must raise funds if they want to continue to serve all ages. That&#39;s the thing that&#39;s amazing about them. They serve it&#39;s from cradle to grave at the East End House. Anyway, I hope going forward, they&#39;ll still get a chunk of money. They&#39;re going to have to raise more money. I hope that the city will really consider making the ground floor of 135 Fulkerson available to them because I think whether they have to pay for it or not, if we want them to stay in Cambridge, I think the city of Cambridge needs to help them find a location in East Cambridge because I think we could lose them otherwise, and that would be very, very sad. for the community. While I feel like we&#39;re about to have a bumpy ride for the next few years, I&#39;m an optimist and I believe that there will still be a lot of development, not only in East Cambridge, at Kendall, but soon At Alewife with the MBTA station, we&#39;re upzoning Cambridge Street, North Mass Ave, Central Square. I just think the Alewife Quad with the Health Peak development, there are going to be lots of opportunities for community benefit and development mitigation funds going forward. which will provide for funding for nonprofits to provide services for residents, but also for open space and parking. So that will be great. I feel like the challenge before us that has been raised by this discussion has been addressing the reality that our nonprofits are often starving for operating and capital expenses. So we&#39;ve really got to figure out how we can address their needs better. And we need to make it better known throughout the city that There are a lot of wealthy people in Cambridge that are local nonprofits need funding, both for operational and capital expenses. And then I agree with my colleagues, we need to have more nuanced conversations about how the community benefits committee functions. Some have suggested that it&#39;s a conflict of interest to have nonprofit leaders on this committee because they advocate for their own nonprofits. Some have suggested that perhaps it should be the Cambridge Community Foundation that helps to disperse these funds to nonprofits because they do that already. Anyway, those are conversations that we&#39;ll have going forward, but I am grateful to all of you here and, again, to... Biomed, thank you. Salazino, thank you for your incredible process. Thank you for all of you in East Cambridge. Thank you, Michael Dillia of the East End House. Thank you, all of you from the nonprofit coalition and my colleagues that negotiated the settlement for negotiating a settlement and allowing us to advance. And I think this will provide a lot of great good for the city. Thank you so much, and I yield. Councilor Zusy yields the floor.</td>

I will lean into brevity, seeing that it&#39;s 85 degrees in here, and we have two or more hours of meeting to go to deliberate. I will say this, one thing my Vice Mayor was very eloquent in his acknowledgement of the process, the work that went into it, how everyone leaned into this regardless of where they stood, it was a very robust process. And given the climate that we&#39;re living in, to be able to have this conversation in so many ways is quite unique. Because other people are closing programs and laying people off, and we&#39;re talking about how we can use a dollar amount to benefit as much of the community as possible. I often talk about the unhappy medium, and I think we might have gotten ourselves there. But at the end of the day, people that are not in this room, children that we&#39;ll never meet, will all benefit from what has happened here in some way. And so to all of us that have a part in this, I say thank you, because it is going to be worth it. It&#39;s going to certainly be worth it. So that being said, Mr. Vice Mayor, I&#39;m going to ask you to make a motion to amend 20.1212 to insert today&#39;s date as your first motion, and then take it from there to vote the amendment of the letter, and then vote the letter of commitment as amended, then to place on file, and then motion toward date. Is that how you have it?</td>

Anyway, I just wondered, I feel like we are already giving multifamily housing developers so many different things. We&#39;re giving them height. We&#39;re giving them no FAR. We&#39;re giving them reduced setbacks. We&#39;re giving them... like a little open space do we I know this is like a nominal nod to them but is it really necessary it seems like that like we could come up with more substantial ways to actually um support the creation of housing that&#39;s what I&#39;m wondering and if anybody has any Feedback about that, if I&#39;m misunderstanding, again, it does seem like it&#39;s a very small number. It&#39;s 2% that we charge. If I&#39;m wrong about that, please correct me. Thank you. I yield.</td>

I&#39;ve been told by the contractors I&#39;ve spoken to that the cost can be pretty substantial and that this would be something that would be greatly appreciated and help defray the costs. And we&#39;re also talking about trying to build more affordable housing. And the more fees and the more costs we put onto building, they&#39;re just going to end up passing it on to the price of the home. So that&#39;s why I&#39;ve put it forward. Thank you, Mr. Chair.

And so it isn&#39;t that significant in the total scheme of things, but it&#39;s probably equivalent to 2% or 3% of inclusionary. And so you can imagine instead of lowering inclusionary by 2% or 3%, you could do this and it&#39;s just one more thing that adds up. Probably not just by itself, but if you do this and a tax abatement and some other things, it really does add up to a significant way that makes buildings more pencil in this difficult environment.</td>

So, you know, people always say, oh, developers get away with their... We have more requirements around environmental impacts and process that people have to... I mean, all of which cost money. I mean, individually, they&#39;re all wonderful, but they all cost money. And so that adds to the cost of a project, which then adds to what... developers have to charge for rents. So all of these things are great, but they all add up. And so if we can maybe save a few bucks here and there, then that&#39;s probably a good thing to do. But we&#39;ll get a report back, and then we&#39;ll figure out where to go from there. So nothing is being finalized tonight. So if there&#39;s no further discussion... Councillor Wilson, anything?

I actually stole your policy order language from 2018, I think, Mr. Vice Mayor, when you put the policy order in for the Central Square bid. This is just to do the preliminary investigation research and data gathering to see if it&#39;s possible and what would need to happen to have it go forward. So there&#39;s no commitment. The hard work would happen after we have this information to then work with the businesses in the community to form the bid.

                <td> through you, Mr. Mayor, to my colleague and colleagues. I&#39;m glad to see this. As Councilor Toner has said, Porter Square has been without that sort of link to the business community, no advocacy, nothing coming from there because no one has sort of been able to or had the support to step up and get this done. And so this is really important that we&#39;re doing it so that Porter Square can always be at the table of conversations when we&#39;re talking about economic development in the city. It&#39;s a large area. It has a lot of economic opportunities there without the representation. So it&#39;s really time that this has happened, and I&#39;m glad that it&#39;s moving forward. I yield.</td>

                <td> I think it&#39;s a good idea for there to be a business association at Porter Square. I understand that they don&#39;t have a business association yet. And I was part of the conversations at Central Square when they were just forming the bid. Yeah. So usually you have a business association first, and then you develop the bid. And I do feel like the bid has made a world of difference at Central Square. Anyway, that&#39;s my only question is, the thing about the bid is at Central Square, you&#39;ve got some anchor tenants. So you&#39;ve got MIT paying a lot of money. You have Matimco. You have a couple big land owners paying a lot of the cost of a bid. A bid has real expenses. And Porter Square is pretty small. So I wonder if it&#39;s premature to be thinking about a bid. I wonder if that shouldn&#39;t happen. Like, shouldn&#39;t there be a Porter Square Business Association developed? And then the bid. Because you&#39;ve got to remember, once you create a bid, you start taxing your business owners, which is an expense, and it seems like everybody&#39;s hurting. Maybe the jump to becoming a bid should be once Porter Square develops, you know, because I think we will be seeing quite a bit of development there within the next ten years, probably in the next five or six years. So that was my quandary. I did talk to Ruth Riles, and I&#39;m glad that... So the other thing is that Central Square, the bid came out of the desire of local businesses for the bid. So is this local businesses are wanting a bid or is this that we&#39;re thinking it might be good for them because they have some issues to address and then it may help to address those issues?</td>

                <td> Thank you. First of all, Porter Square, the zone we&#39;re talking about isn&#39;t just the Porter Square shopping center. We&#39;re talking about everything from the Cambridge Common, the restaurant, all the way to the other side of Porter Square down to Walden Street where I always refer to the Kentucky Fried Chicken. So that whole strip of Mass Ave. And if you go and look at everything from the Leslie building, the old Sears and Roebuck building, down to Harvard Square, I think there&#39;s about 70 or 80 restaurants, small shops, et cetera. And as you&#39;ve pointed out, Council Zusy, it&#39;s actually the landowners that are the ones that would pay the dues or the fees, not the individual small businesses. They would get the benefit. And as I know on the Central Square bid, they have the landowners, they have the businesses, they have some of the nonprofits on their board, et cetera. But again, this is just to investigate the feasibility and get some research and data. And I would argue there&#39;s no reason to start with a business association. And I&#39;m sure if you talk to Jason Alves of the East Cambridge Business Association, he would probably love to go straight to a bid. And I&#39;m sure he&#39;s thinking about it at some point. But there&#39;s actually a lot of big land anchor properties along that stretch of Mass Ave. So again, it may never happen. This is to do the research to see the feasibility of it.

And if it turns out the answer is, gee, maybe a business association is better, that will clearly come out of it. But this has been long overdue. When we did the bike lanes, there was no business association to go out and talk to all the neighbors. I mean, the whole idea is Mayor Simmons and Councillor Toner and Councillor McGovern said this is something that folks have wanted some organization and I think it&#39;s really important again to remember this is a feasibility study to say let&#39;s go out and talk to people and find out what&#39;s missing what&#39;s not and it is completely unfair in a way that the Porter Square Neighborhood Association has ended up functioning as the only equivalent of a business association because there is no other thing so I&#39;m really happy to co-sponsor. I&#39;ve also talked to folks about this and talked to small businesses who are frustrated that they don&#39;t have a business association. Sometimes Harvard Square Business Association steps in because it&#39;s the closest one, but again, it&#39;s a different area of the city and there&#39;s a lot of people involved. So I support this and hope we can move forward and get the city on it.</td>

First, and the mayor, I think this was even before I got on the council, that Central Square did try to move forward with a bid 20 years ago, maybe, and it didn&#39;t happen because you have to have a certain percentage of the property owners agree to it before a bid can actually be enacted. If the property owners don&#39;t vote to be part of it, it&#39;s not going to happen. So, you know, and the Central Square Business Association was first, but the bid conversation for Central Square has actually been going on decades. So the first is, if there&#39;s no further discussion, to amend the policy order to include Councilor Nolan and myself. Roll call.</td>

                <td> Thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor, and through you to my colleagues. So this order arises from an unmistakably quality of life problem that has been brewing for a long time on the stretch of Massachusetts Avenue between St. James Episcopal Church and the Beach Street condominiums. And my office has field several calls, lots of calls from nearby residents talking about sleepless nights, discarded needles, brazen transactions carried out under the porch lights. Ignoring those voices would be a dereliction of duty. We cannot sort of turn a blind eye to what people are concerned about in that neighborhood. But also, let me be clear. I deeply respect the church&#39;s mission. I had a very positive call with Reverend Stewart before filing this order. I was very deliberate about that because I did not want Reverend Stewart or the St. James community to find out Thursday or by word of mouth that this policy order was being offered. So I wanted to be very intentional about engaging St. James so they would know what was coming forward and why. And the pastor and I were in full agreement that no one should be criminalized simply because they have nowhere to sleep. And St. James has offered sanctuary to individuals who feel unsafe or unwelcomed in traditional shelters. And that compassion, I believe, is both admirable and entirely consistent with Cambridge&#39;s values. And I commend Reverend Stewart and his congregation for their kindness and their empathy. And I just want to say, both Reverend Stewart and I both agree that we should not criminalize are unhoused residents or people that are in our city. And so I do get a little bit miffed at people saying they were being arrested. They were arrested and strong-arming by the police because that was not happening. Having said that though, good intentions do not grant immunity from misuse. And so when word spread that a space is sort of hands off for law enforcement, it can attract bad actors. And people who are not there for rest or refuge, but are there for the commerce of fentanyl and methamphetamines or taking advantage of those who may be susceptible to addiction. And this is not conjecture. It is playing right now, playing out on that garden strip. So for me, I say that because compassion without boundaries is merely abdication. And common sense tells us that we do not need to find, that we do have to find a more valuable balance. Some of the pushback I received about bringing this order forward suggested I was calling for a sweep of the police in that area. Clearly was not. And the commission is not here, and I&#39;m glad she&#39;s not because it&#39;s rather late in the evening, but they have been deliberately not having a heavy hand and taking a hands-off policy around rest or any sort of manhandling. So that was just simply not true. And quite frankly, it&#39;s insulting that people would say that. It disregards the decades that I, in particular, you, Mr. Vice Mayor, and others have used building trust with our interfaith leaders, standing with our unhoused population and our advocates, working to ensure our policies reflect both compassion and common sense. So this order doesn&#39;t ask for a crackdown. It asks for a plan. A coordinated city-led approach to ensure that people who need a safe place to sleep are treated with dignity. And those who are exploiting that space for dangerous or illegal activities are not given free reign. If the city needs additional tools to strike that balance, we want to understand what those are. And I&#39;d like to know that by October 1st. So to suggest that this is somehow an attack on the church or the unhoused community is just inaccurate. It is a disservice to the people who have been raising legitimate concerns. in looking for us for leadership and assistance. Cambridge can and must walk and chew gum. Uphold the church&#39;s humanitarian outreach while preventing our public private spaces from becoming corridors of illicit activity. That&#39;s the balance. That&#39;s the hallmark of our government and our governance. And that is all this order seeks to do is secure a safe place. And that&#39;s why I hope my colleagues will support this order. However, I will say I have heard. from members of the church, and I know that they&#39;re working on some sort of mediation that&#39;s supposed to happen very shortly. So because of that, I am going to exercise my charter right. This will come up in September, or as I said, no later than October 1st. Something has to happen that makes this place secure that, again, honors what St. James is trying to do, but also respects the right of the people that live there. I yield the floor.</td>

                <td> Councilor, Mayor Simmons has exercised her charter right. We will move on to policy order number five. This was filed by myself, Councilor Siddiqui, and Councilor Wilson. It reads as follows. That the city manager is requested to work with the Department of Public Health department of public works and any other relevant city departments to develop a plan to install needle drop boxes in identified problem areas throughout the city i do have an amendment a small amendment to add to that i&#39;ll just say in in general as it says in the order that the uh the Central Square bid picks up tens of thousands of needles in the city. They also, in the drop box that&#39;s located on Green Street, they also get thousands of needles dropped off there. We hear from across the city, particularly around our parks and open areas, that people are finding needles discarded. and uh you know this isn&#39;t going to solve this doesn&#39;t mean that you&#39;re never going to find a needle in a place where you don&#39;t want it to be but if you want people to stop doing something you have to help them stop doing it and um that&#39;s what these needle drop boxes do i&#39;ll quickly want to just address one comment that was made in in public comment where where it was said that you know if we do this we&#39;re going to be encouraging people to use drugs and i could just assure you that there&#39;s nobody i&#39;ve been working with folks struggling with substance use disorder for thirty years i can assure you that no one is going to say hey the city just put a drop box in this park i think i&#39;m going to start shooting up It doesn&#39;t work that way. It doesn&#39;t happen that way. So this is not about encouraging people. This is a complicated issue. We have to fight it on many fronts. But again, if you want to try and dissuade people from taking an action you don&#39;t want them to take, then you need to provide resources for them to do something differently. And that&#39;s what this does. The amendment, I don&#39;t know if Ms. Steffan wants to put it up. And again, I understand that this is a little bit more complicated, but I do want to add, in addition, when we get that report back, that not only a report back on needle drop boxes, but also installing naloxone, Narcan boxes as well. We have heard from a number of people that they have come across people who have overdosed or are in the process of overdosing, and most people don&#39;t carry Narcan. It&#39;s been a very scary situation to literally sit there and watch someone potentially die. So if we can also think about installing Narcan boxes more consistently around the city, that will save lives as well. So that&#39;s the amendment. So I&#39;ll open it up for discussion. Any? No, no, no, no, no. Oh, Councilor Zusy.</td>

So I think it&#39;s a good idea to have the needle boxes. But I just want to remind us that needle boxes will improve the state of public health because Little children are less likely to step on the needles, but it&#39;s not going to solve the problem, right? So I feel like it improves things a little bit, but it doesn&#39;t solve the whole problem. But I will support this. I wonder, is it... Like, what is going on? Is it that we have more, is drug use up? Or is it that we have, you know, that&#39;s a little, or that we have more people that are on drugs? Do we have any sense of the trends?</td>

                <td>Well, I mean, we don&#39;t, we can, if, maybe if Ellen were still here, but I would just say in general that we&#39;re seeing drug use consistently increase, although there&#39;s been some drop in deaths. But the drop in deaths has been because we have taken steps, not just in Cambridge, but across the state, in making things like Narcan more available, by doing more outreach, by distributing clean needles. So a lot of those steps are helping to, those harm reduction strategies are helping to keep people alive, but usage is not going down. And, you know, again, just it was referred to in the, some people mentioned it during the discussion of the policy order number three. Just last week, the occupant of the White House signed an executive order basically criminalizing homelessness, drug use, and mental illness and really basically came out and said other harm reduction strategies like overdose prevention centers, which we&#39;ve talked a lot about in this chamber, he&#39;s going to go after criminally any person or city that really tries to help engage in harm reduction, which is something we all should have expected coming from that source. To short answer, drug use is not decreasing. Deaths have decreased slightly, but still way too many people dying. So if there&#39;s no further discussion on the amendment.</td>

I have to, as a mom, before we go into park spaces or before I let him run free, I literally have to do a scan of the parks. not only just the grounds of them, but also the play structures. We have had emails in regards to human feces in places and all this stuff. And so safety for me as a mom is really important. And, you know, while this may not solve the issue, this will hopefully improve kind of needles, just being just safe, Just just placed wherever in at least placed in safe spaces, so that our children, our babies or anyone else doesn&#39;t have to be stuck by one which I think we also got. An email, or at least I received an email regarding a child being stuck by a needle Thank God, they are okay, but again. this is not acceptable that needles are just being dropped wherever. And so as many safe drop boxes as we can have, hopefully people will use them and we can minimize at least those needles being in spaces where our children are playing or our elders may be wanting, you know, participating in recreational activities, et cetera. But again, as a mom, who frequents a lot of these spaces, it is unacceptable that I have to really scan a space before my child goes into play because of these risks.</td>

So I sent some possible amendments to the clerk just to make that clear and to clarify the current situation. So it notes in one of the whereases that Senator Ed Markey has filed a companion resolution in the Senate, and therefore the resolves change in line with that.</td>

                <td> Hold on. I really appreciate my colleague&#39;s input. And I&#39;m sure we all record that the first order appeared before us in June and it was laid on the table so the administration could analyze its implications and continue conversation with Apex Clean Energy. I&#39;ve since reviewed the city manager&#39;s feedback in detail. Thank you, Mr. City Manager. The language contained in the order is deliberate. It does not instruct Cambridge to abandon the power purchase agreement with the North Dakota City with North Dakota, it does register this council&#39;s disappointment, however, with a deal that advances our common goals while shortchanging the very workers who made those goals possible. And if that stings a little, then shame on us because both the council and the administration, because we have been, we&#39;re prepared to claim environmental wins at the expense of working people. Tony Pini and our partners from LIUNA were the ones who first brought this to my attention. LIUNA&#39;s reporting indicates that Apex prioritizes cheaper non-union, non-local labor over skilled North Dakota union members. Repeated attempts by liona to secure a good faith dialogue has been met with polite deflection that is that is not how a responsible partner behaves so cambridge has always linked the climate ambition with economic justice if addressing these concerns creates some short-term headaches for the city then that that&#39;s a hit that i think we should take my greater aim is that we is that this episode is a lesson for all of us from now on. Any proposed contract that touts an environmental upside while shifting the economic burden onto workers should be immediately flagged, rigorously scrutinized, and if necessary, rejected outright. We must never allow ourselves to be dazzled by green metrics achieved by cutting wages, undermining collective bargaining rights, or exporting good jobs elsewhere. Environmental stewardship divorced from workforce fairness is quite simply not stewardship at all. That is not the kind of example I want Cambridge to be setting. It should not be the example that we want to set. And that&#39;s why I hope my colleagues will support this policy as written. And with that, I thank you and yield the floor.</td>

The law department did recommend these changes to the policy order because the city, through the city&#39;s administration, has entered into an agreement with Apex for a... virtual power purchasing agreement where after the solar plant is constructed, the city is buying the energy attributes that are generated from the solar facility. As part of that agreement, we do have conditions that bind the city administration through the city manager to how we communicate about the project and working cooperatively with Apex on those communications. So although the city council being the legislative body is separate from the executive who entered into this agreement and therefore not subject to the contract in the same way as the executive branch. We did recommend that we broaden the policy order to not make it specifically about this particular agreement with APEX where we would, you know, the executive branch does have to work cooperatively in our communications. But to more broadly talk about in the future when the city is looking to enter into these type of energy agreements that the city council express their belief that the city should look at prioritizing union labor AS CONDITIONS TO OUR FUTURE VIRTUAL POWER PURCHASING AGREEMENTS FOR ENERGY ATTRIBUTES. WE THOUGHT THAT WAS IN THE SPIRIT OF THE AGREEMENT THAT THE CITY&#39;S EXECUTIVE ENTERED INTO FOR THE COUNCIL TO ALSO BE MINDFUL OF THOSE COMMUNICATIONS, BUT STILL express their you know strong and worthy feelings about needing to prioritize labor in the future thank you manager anything</td>

I think it does represent the spirit of what was in the original order without, I think, intersecting in an unfavorable way with the existing contracts we&#39;ve entered into. I do just want to recognize that this is a very unique agreement that allows us to purchase renewable energy in some of the dirtier grids in the country and in collaboration with more than a dozen other institutions. And so in many ways, it is the uniqueness and complexity of this arrangement that I think has made it a little bit less clear exactly how we&#39;re acting, but I think certainly this policy order expressed the desire from the council, if it&#39;s passed, that we continue to push and create as much possibility for us to use local labor and to prioritize paying prevailing wage as we can as we enter into future agreements. And so I appreciate the willingness to consider this. And I think certainly I feel like there&#39;s these conversations that we&#39;ll want to continue to have. And I think the earlier the better in these processes versus after the fact.</td>

I just take a very different tact. I think that the amendments, and thank you, Councilor Toner, for your thoughtfulness. sanitizes the policy order to the degree it doesn&#39;t say anything to Apex or its subsidiary that we&#39;re displeased. We&#39;re not saying we&#39;re not going to go through with the contract, we&#39;re just saying we&#39;re displeased with the fact of how you are treating workers and you&#39;re not paying them a fair wage, something we stand for all the time without blinking. So to sanitize the order to say we&#39;re standing up for our principals, so what? We already do that. What we&#39;re trying to say to Apex, someone who is taking our money, that we do not want to pay for other people&#39;s oppression. That&#39;s how I see it. By not saying something to them, at least making them knowledgeable about it. We are participating and oppressing a group of other people, and that&#39;s not what we do here. So I would strongly, again, I thank my colleague for his thoughtfulness. I don&#39;t agree. It&#39;s not going to be the first time. I would ask the council to vote it the way it is written. I stand down.</td>

I want to completely support workers and I do understand that there&#39;s some risk to the city involved if we if we go with the original, and I&#39;m concerned about that. I also want to note that the amendments talk very strongly about supporting local labels, supporting union, moving forward with it, and that letter that we all received from Apex said very clearly that the stated commitment for Bowman Wind is to encourage the balance of plant contractor to source the construction workforce from North Dakota. We&#39;ve remained consistent with this commitment, hiring workers from several local entities. They engaged a construction, so their focus is on local labor and also a IBEW union subcontractor located in Montana, which is less than three hours from the job site because they couldn&#39;t find anyone closer. They&#39;ve distributed it to other union workers. they have said very clearly they have met their commitment made during the permitting and as the city manager said this is an odd thing that we&#39;re not actually doing the construction we&#39;re not even contracting for the construction we&#39;re contracting for the output of this construction so it&#39;s hard for i think that&#39;s the the dilemma here for us to require something on construction when we&#39;re not even involved with the construction i really appreciate the mayor bringing this forward and understanding that There were some concerns, and I respect the unions who came forward and spoke about this, but I will be supporting the substitute because I think it&#39;s really important to separate that out again. Anytime the city is involved directly in construction, it would make sense to require that. It&#39;s in our living wage and all our ordinances. This is a completely different, this is almost like a financial contract that is at great risk, and there&#39;s the additional risk of possible breach of contract by Apex Energy if we pass the language as is, and I&#39;m not willing to take that risk as a city. We are facing so many other risks as a city. We have a gazillion lawsuits going on. I really just wanna make sure this is clean as possible. So thank you, I yield.</td>

With the mayor on this, I&#39;m very reluctant to, particularly to support the watered down version, given that the union themselves weren&#39;t consulted. Several members of the union came out when we discussed this last time in support and thanking us for standing with them. If they were here saying we&#39;re okay with these amendments, I would feel differently. But given that they are not, and as counselor toner said you know he didn&#39;t have the opportunity to speak with them i&#39;m sort of i don&#39;t feel like i want to water this down without hearing from them um out of respect so there&#39;s that but again we can go to a vote so there&#39;s um we can also vote and again i don&#39;t know tell someone tell me about the timing of things but we could also vote to keep this on the table or to put it back on the table. We can vote the amendment. If the amendment fails, the amendments fail, someone could move to pass the order or we can vote to keep it on the table. Is that correct? You looking at me?

                <td> Mr. Manager. I mean, I think, just to clarify Councilor Razeem&#39;s point, I would say that we put the city solicitor in a bad position to ask her if such an action would result in a lawsuit that we would lose. It&#39;s sort of an unanswerable question for the city solicitor to publicly state that if an action were taken, that she would not be able to defend us. So I think we have provided this council with a pretty clear sense of the choice before you We have duly entered into this contract. It is a financing arrangement that is fairly complex. We are always available for additional explanation of what this is and the powers that we have as we negotiate these complex arrangements with other institutions. And I recognize the purity that we seek in terms of wanting to be able to say that every single arrangement that we act through has met every single standard that I think we hold. Recognizing that we actually had staff working for many years in order to put this virtual power purchase agreement together, there was a lot of work to make sure that it could actually happen. I&#39;ll also emphasize that this VPPA is the core mechanism by which we will meet our butto obligations. And so I sort of recognize like, hey, there is an important conversation with the union. There&#39;s a forward looking question about how we may approach future contracts. But I would urge this body and encourage you to be thinking about the really significant investment of time and resources that we&#39;ve put into this contract and the importance that it plays in meeting our climate goals, as well as the legal liability that we could be exposing ourselves to. I think to the solicitor&#39;s point, we would be able to defend ourselves by noting that the council is simply stating something. But I think we all have this conversation many times. The council is not a body that doesn&#39;t represent the city in a pretty substantive form, especially if the majority of the council acts. And so I think I&#39;m happy. I feel like the council has all the information it needs. And ultimately, you&#39;re gonna make a decision. It would probably be better just to do it tonight and be done with this, but we are always available if you want to put this back on the table and we want to have further conversation. I think both Deputy City Manager Watkins and City Solicitor Bayer could provide additional context around both the amount of work that went into this, the importance it is towards our climate goals, and the legal risk that is posed in front of us.

I think the thought as we&#39;ve heard the community would appreciate updates and answers to some of the questions that have been raised. This could be answered in a community meeting or a public safety meeting of the council. We just thought it was very important given the timeliness of this to get this onto the agenda for tonight so the city manager would have the communication.</td>

I&#39;m glad it ended without a loss of life, but I think it raises some questions, including about the use of chemical agents. So I&#39;m hoping we can get these answers. And I had reached out to the city manager to see if there could be something on the agenda today. They weren&#39;t able to put anything on there. So we thought it was important to put some of the questions we were hearing from residents and had ourselves go back.</td>
