<p><strong>Public Comment Speakers (2 minutes each due to 42 sign-ups):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Michael Demella (CEO, Charles Gate):</strong> Strongly supported Policy Order #68, advocating for improved inclusionary policies to prevent stalled development. Noted Boston's 2023 increase to 20% inclusionary requirement led to a development freeze.</li>
<li><strong>Daniel Seaborg (Managing Partner, North Cambridge Partners, 2400 Mass Ave):</strong> Highlighted discrepancies in CDD's development log, stating only 7 of 41 "current" residential projects are under construction, and 3,700 of 5,300 units lack building permits. Emphasized zero multifamily inclusionary deliveries in 2025.</li>
<li><strong>Josh Zakim (Executive Director, Housing Forward Massachusetts):</strong> Supported Policy Order #68, stressing the need for affordable housing and acknowledging macroeconomic challenges. Suggested reviewing and adjusting inclusionary housing requirements for immediate impact.</li>

Opposed Charter Order #1, arguing that lowering inclusionary thresholds would not overcome macroeconomic conditions and could lead to gentrification.</li>
<li><strong>David Halperin (14 Valentine Street):</strong> Advocated for nimble inclusionary zoning policies to maximize affordable units. Supported first-floor retail, suggesting restrictions on certain uses (e.g., "corner stores and cafes, no labs and dance clubs").</li>
<li><strong>Jana Odette (Larch Road):</strong> Opposed retail on every street, citing concerns about bypassing zoning and difficulty in selective retail allowances. Questioned the timing of inclusionary housing requirement changes after recent upzoning.</li>

Supported all programs in Charter Right #2, prioritizing vouchers for Transitional Wellness Center residents.</li>
<li><strong>Henry Wirtis (106 Berkshire Street):</strong> Argued that profit-driven development has failed to address the housing crisis. Advocated for new solutions like community land trusts and social housing, urging the Council to learn from other cities.</li>
