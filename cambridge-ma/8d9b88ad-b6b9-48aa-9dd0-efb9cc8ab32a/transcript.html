                <td> Good evening, Mayor and Councillors. My name is Mike Demella. I&#39;m the CEO of Charles Gate, a development advisory firm and housing advocate across Greater Boston. I am also a former chairman of the Greater Boston Real Estate Board and a current member of the City of Boston Zoning Commission. I am here to strongly support policy order number 68. We are in a housing emergency, and well-intentioned inclusionary policies as currently structured are worsening that problem. Over 20,000 multifamily units across greater Boston are entitled but stalled, mostly due to economic infeasibility. This has made even worse with current inclusionary policy. In 2023, Boston&#39;s inclusionary requirement was increased from 13% to 20% after a vote of the Zoning Commission. Studies showed minimal development impact. However, instead, development froze. This vote was a mistake. Cambridge has a chance to learn from that policy order number 68 charts a path forward to improve inclusionary policy without stopping development altogether. Let&#39;s achieve equity through pragmatism and abundance and make sure new housing that is very much needed actually gets built. And I&#39;ve included some written testimony, so I&#39;ll give back to the remainder of my time, but I appreciate and thank you for your consideration.</td>

                <td>Good evening again, mayor and counselors. Good to see you. Dan Seabor, managing partner of North Cambridge Partners, 2400 Mass Ave. I think many of us here have noticed that in our national politics we&#39;ve gotten into a peculiar situation where quite often we no longer agree on basic facts and information, such that to even have an informed policy debate has become almost impossible. I worry that through no real fault of anyone&#39;s we&#39;ve lost sight of the facts on housing in Cambridge. In turn, this is endangering all of our ability to have a real policy debate about how to move forward. So let me share with you some facts about the current situation using CDD&#39;s development log as a measuring stick. The development log claims 41 so-called current residential projects comprising roughly 5,300 units and 4 million square feet. In fact, only seven of those 41 projects are actually under construction, and just one of them is a true 20% inclusionary project. Of those 5,300 units, roughly 3,700 don&#39;t even have a building permit. That&#39;s about 3.4 million of the 4 million square feet included in the log as current. More than half of the square footage in the development log is actually comprised of just two mega projects. PUD contemplated housing at Cambridge Crossing and the Volpe Center that exists only in the imagination. That is to say years if not a decade away from even hypothetically existing. And in the case of Cambridge Crossing, that&#39;s not even subject to the 20% rule. The log contains projects labeled as housing that are in fact dorms or hotels. It contains projects that have been vacant lots for years. It contains projects that were completed more than four quarters ago. I could go on. But the most important facts remain. In 2024, Cambridge had one new multifamily inclusionary delivery, yielding three affordable units total. We&#39;ve had zero deliveries and zero starts in 2025. Those are the facts. I&#39;d be happy to walk through the data with any of you anytime. Thank you very much.</td>

                <td>Thank you. Good evening, Madam Mayor, counselors. My name is Josh Zakim. I&#39;m the Executive Director of Housing Forward Massachusetts with an address of 10 Tremont Street in downtown Boston. Housing Forward is a 501 nonprofit focused on data-backed policy solutions for housing crisis here in Massachusetts. I&#39;ve submitted written testimony, which I hope you&#39;ll find helpful, and I&#39;m going to summarize some of it here in support of policy order number 68. As a former Boston City Councilor myself, I know how tough these debates can be and the decisions that are in front of you to support your communities and your neighbors. Affordable housing, workforce housing, reasonably priced housing, whatever we want to call it, is in far too short supply in Cambridge and throughout Massachusetts. Inclusionary zoning is an important tool that can help ensure that we maintain communities that have different folks from different socioeconomic backgrounds and statuses. But we also need to be cognizant of outside factors like the macroeconomic conditions we&#39;re all facing right now. of tariffs that go up one day and away the next day, make it impossible for folks to adequately predict how much it will cost to build housing, raising costs overwhelmingly, higher interest rates on construction loans, et cetera, et cetera. It goes on and on. One tool that you have that municipalities around the Commonwealth have is around land use regulation. Looking to review and adjust and reduce the requirement for inclusionary housing is something that could have an immediate impact and create more new housing, affordable housing and market rate housing in our communities today. I urge you to look at this deeply, to talk to the experts, to review the facts and the data when it&#39;s very clear that this is something that is in front of us today that can make a true difference. for now and in the future of your community. And quite frankly, it&#39;s of interest to all of Greater Boston because we need to do everything we can to reduce the cost of housing. And this is one tool during these times that can make a real difference. Thank you for your consideration. I appreciate your time.</td>

I know how much work you&#39;ve all put into this. You&#39;re all looking hard at this issue, are weighing the different aspects of it, and there are many. You know, former Councilor Ken Reeves is a friend and spoke at the last meeting about how hard fought the 20% was. And so this should not be lightly considered. I will say that I think the arguments are out there. I also submitted written testimony that goes through the facts and echoes what you&#39;ve heard thus far from the other speakers. I would just say that I think the temptation will be to study this and to take some time. And I do know that that&#39;s important. I think you&#39;re all aware that many of us have followed Cambridge&#39;s policies and rules, have met with the neighbors, have gone through all of the hoops. And it will be really sad if some of those projects, which have done everything that Cambridge asked us to do, now can&#39;t move forward because of this issue. So thank you for looking very closely at this, looking for all the levers that you could pull. You&#39;ve got hundreds of housing units across Cambridge that could come into reality. It&#39;s what we need. And it&#39;s going to take some, some fortitude, I think, from the council to figure out how to, how to adjust the policies so this all becomes possible. Thank you very much.</td>

                <td> Hi, my name is Rita Guastella. I own a small two family at 127 Reed Street in Cambridge. I&#39;m speaking about policy order 68 and specifically about the request to reduce the percentage of inclusionary housing required of the developers at 2400 Mass Ave. I represented the neighborhood along with my neighbors at the over 10 meetings we had at the bio lab for over a year. I watched what I can only call the gold standard of community involvement in the development of this project. We began with opposing views, we were like this, and during the process of listening to one another, we ended up a united front, and I&#39;m not kidding about that. I do believe in the goal of inclusionary housing, but I also want to protect what they and we have created. I want to humbly ask you to consider more than one goal. that you consider the quality of the work that will be done in our neighborhood, the respect we feel for one another, and our dedication to something special in North Cambridge. I ask you to permit the reduction from 20% to 8%. I thank you, and I cede my time to the chair.</td>

                <td> Yeah, Stan Rifkin, 17 Channing Street. I applaud the council for their commitment to create a municipal voucher program. that could potentially cover formerly unhoused and mixed status immigrant households who are at risk of losing their housing. This is an important piece of Cambridge&#39;s response to the federal assault on the poor. Still, it&#39;s extremely disappointing that the city is committed to closing the Transitional Wellness Center and lacks any plan that it&#39;s been willing to share with the public, at least, to guarantee suitable housing for the 22 remaining residents. It&#39;s incomprehensible to me how we can be complicit in closing a homeless shelter without so much as providing the residents any place to go. Finding a solution to this is not rocket science. Look, are we really expected to believe that the council simply lacks the collective creativity, ingenuity, kindness, determination to find a solution to this? Just to house the folks that we&#39;re displacing? I really don&#39;t know, but I guess we&#39;re all about to find out here in the coming hours. I certainly hope not. I hope the city finds suitable permanent housing for these folks and prioritizes them for vouchers rather than throws them out to the street, out of sight, out of mind, all while focusing on more handouts for developers who you have been hearing from so far in today&#39;s meeting. Speaking of which, regarding charter order one, you can&#39;t overcome macroeconomic conditions by lowering the threshold. That&#39;s simply not going to work. Secondly, Cambridge just passed one of the most ambitious of zoning ordinances. We won&#39;t know for years whether this is going to encourage a building and or potentially even have adverse consequences. I&#39;m studying this now when the only data we have is the testimony of these developers would heavily bias the results to the position of developers and speculators and wouldn&#39;t take into account any of the serious consequences of lowering the inclusionary threshold, including gentrification. And finally, we shouldn&#39;t believe developers&#39; claims. It&#39;s in their financial interest to create a perception of inaffordability with regard to inclusionary. Thank you.</td>

                <td>Good evening. David Halperin, 14 Valentine Street. Firstly, on inclusionary zoning. I do hope we can think hard about how we can be nimble here. Even after we get the next report on IZ, we&#39;re going to be skating to where the puck was. And over those next few years where that&#39;s our IZ report, who knows what else is going to happen in the economy. And we need to think hard about, in the long term, how can we maximize the number of affordable units we&#39;ve created over time? And just having a high percentage, I think we can look... At you know current conditions and how, after our very ambitious upsetting which you know, like I am a huge proponent of let nothing is getting built. You know, like, how can we be creative, how can we, you know how can we overcome and actually you know get some affordable units. On first floor retail I really strongly support this moving forward. I think, you know, people have raised concerns about different uses, and I think it makes a lot of sense to be restrictive about which uses. Yes, corner stores and cafes, no labs and dance clubs. within what we can agree is good. I hope we can be expansive about allowing encouragement, you know, mixed use and walkability are what draw a lot of people such as myself to Cambridge. And I personally love a restaurant to open next door. And, you know, in neighborhoods where we&#39;re hoping that are currently low scale, but we&#39;re hoping maybe a lot more apartments might exist in the future, you know, that would support, you know, that would be well supported by having more welcome amenities there, which I think is important in the long term. So yeah, I hope there are details to flesh out, but I hope we can pass this and keep this conversation going. Thank you.</td>

Thank you, honorable mayor, city manager, assistant city manager, neither of whom are here, and counselors who I know you&#39;ve been working long and hard on all this stuff. So thank you for your attention tonight, and thank you for your work before now. My name is Jen Odette. I live on Larch Road, and I wanted to speak to two points tonight. One is in pretty much direct contrast to the gentleman who just spoke, no to retail on every street. I think that this goes against bypassing proper zoning channels. It goes against all the zoning that we&#39;ve had. And I guess my understanding of the rule is that it would be very hard to be selective as to what kind of retail you allow. And I think that, to the gentleman&#39;s point who just spoke, the fact that you might want a restaurant but you wouldn&#39;t want a bar or a dance club, I mean, I don&#39;t know that you can have that finesse. The other thing is on this affordable housing requirements. And I do believe we have heard from a lot of developers this evening. And I guess the question is, is this time to just take the profit model for how housing gets done, or is this time to be a little creative? And sorry, I didn&#39;t fully prepare. Shoot. Anyway, the point is that I think that this might be a time to look at other ways of answering the call, especially with the fact that it is possible that a lot of businesses will be shutting down and so forth. So now is the time to be creative about What can you do that is not just changing the percentage from 20% to 10% or whatever it is? I just think that is a little crazy when you just got through this upzoning proposal. Anyway, I&#39;m sorry that I was not better organized. Thank you for your time.</td>

                <td>Marlin Majid, 71 Reed Street. I work with Our Revolution Cambridge and the Cambridge Housing Justice Coalition. Council should not support Charter Right 1. I strongly oppose both the proposed study and any reduction in percentage of inclusionary units. I find it absolutely incredible and totally unacceptable that the city just passed multifamily zoning based on projections of inclusionary housing being built at 20%. and before any buildings could move forward is considering lowering the percentage. Something&#39;s wrong here. CDD gave us estimates in good faith. How are they immediately afterwards discredited? Zoning decisions relied very heavily on those facts. You owe it to the voters to see if what the city estimated in consultation with developers happens before considering changing the rules of the game. If private developers build less in the interim, I hope there will be more opening for the Cambridge Community Land Trust and social housing. I strongly support all the programs in Charter Right 2. If, as other people have said, the Transitional Wellness Center is closed, and I&#39;d be very sorry to see that, please assure that all the remaining people get housing vouchers. I understand there&#39;s some potential compromise underway to provide more money for unhoused people. And I think this population should have priority in getting that money moving forwards.

The national housing shortage impacts the people of Cambridge with unusual force because the demand for housing is so enormous that costs are typically high and inflexible. Trump&#39;s policies have only made things worse. The people of Cambridge and its government believed that profit-driven development was the path out of this crisis. Every year the public demanded more housing and less restrictive zoning. This has now been shown to be a false promise. Developers in demanding a reduction in inclusionary housing have revealed that their profit-driven plans don&#39;t work. They are bullying us with the threat, no profits for us, no housing for you. We need to change our thinking and explore new solutions such as community land trusts and social housing. To begin, the council, through its housing committee, should hold hearings to learn from the experiences of cities like Vienna and Paris and countries like Mexico and Brazil. We need to learn what the residents of Cambridge want in our social housing so we don&#39;t impose housing programs that do not work. The council should be bold and not rely on strategies tied to traditional models and the constraints of a market-driven housing economy. Please show Cambridge&#39;s creativity and produce models of community land trusts and social housing that put revenue from housing into more housing projects and not into the pockets of developers.

Two things I want to speak to. One is I really don&#39;t think the inclusionary standard should be changed. It is hard enough right now for low-income people who are sitting on the inclusionary list to even be able to look at anything that is within their AMI. That&#39;s number one. Number two, why I came here beside that, and there are people in this room right now, and you need to face these people who are living at Spalding. Twenty-two vouchers is not a whole lot to ask, and that&#39;s all that&#39;s needed right now. Otherwise, these people are out on the street. People are well aware of the fact that I work in a homeless shelter at the Lindeman Health Center in Boston. This is unimaginable that you would just throw people out on the street and ask them to do what? There has been no plan put in place for these people at all and the Albany shelter is not appropriate for many of the residents of the Spaulding shelter and people do actually know that. And I hate to put it in the realm of you people, but quite honestly, take a look around. There are people in this room here who currently live at the Spalding. You have to answer to them as to what they need. 22 vouchers is not a whole lot. And quite honestly, I&#39;ve lived in this city for 45 years. These people deserve a heck of a lot better than they&#39;re getting right now out of the city council. I hate to be like this, but I will be, because the reality is I don&#39;t want to see them down at the Lindemann Mental Health Center trying to deal with what&#39;s going on down there. And you cannot just put this on Trump. This is an old problem here in Cambridge, and it needs to be resolved humanely. Thank you.</td>

But the process is wrong that it&#39;s not writing in there that it&#39;s the reduction in inclusionary units or more people would be commenting on it. It&#39;s We just passed the inclusionary being 20%. By putting it in question, that&#39;s going to put developers on notice to basically wait it out, and that&#39;s going to cause nothing to be developed in the near term. We need to distinguish between the economic and the sociological issues. 20% is a reasonable mix of lower income people with the market rate apartments. And if we need to make handouts for developers, we should do it in ways that are not lowering the 20%. The other thing is why in this time of poverty are we giving handouts for developers at all? We should be focusing on putting money in the hands of the poor people and then enabling them to buy things that trickle up rather than trickling down. The macroeconomic conditions of Trump&#39;s tariffs and trade war with Canada and other countries isn&#39;t going to be made really any different by changing the percentage. It&#39;s not going to make things built. Perhaps the tariffs will go away. Perhaps they won&#39;t. We don&#39;t know. But these things... We need to wait it out and be steady and keep the 20%. If you need to give money to developers, which I don&#39;t really support, but better not to lower the 20%. We want to maximize the affordable units. That&#39;s our most important priority. And in terms of the case study, we should look at discrimination against inclusionary tenants as you did on 12-13-22. Thank you.</td>

                <td>Hello. My name is Mohib Ahmed. My address is at 900 Yard, Cambridge, Mass. I want to begin by sincerely thanking the council for committing to support Rise Up and preserve housing vouchers for migrant and formerly unhoused families. That is the right decision and it reflects the values we like to believe define Cambridge. But there is still one urgent piece missing, the Spalding Transitional Wellness Center. There are 22 people still living at Spalding. These people are in recovery, people with complex medical needs, people who cannot thrive in congregate settings. If we close this shelter without a real plan for where they will go, we&#39;re not just eliminating a program, we&#39;re choosing to displace people who have already endured the worst this world has to offer. I&#39;ve watched my classmates and administrators take real risks to stand up to federal attacks on immigrants, trans people, and the poor. The city council has rightfully celebrated that courage, saying, we&#39;ve got your back. But if our city government can&#39;t find a way to keep 22 medically vulnerable people housed during a national housing and overdose crisis, those words truly start to ring hollow. Cambridge cannot preach resistance to Trumpism while practicing abandonment. We cannot oppose cruelty at the national level while replicating it at the local level just because it&#39;s quieter, just because it affects people who don&#39;t have a voice in this room. And let&#39;s be clear, this isn&#39;t about affordability. The total cost of maintaining Spalding and other critical services comes to about $3 a month for the average homeowner. It&#39;s not a budgetary crisis. It&#39;s immoral discipline. Council have shown real leadership by protecting programs like Rise Up. Now it must finish the war. Keep Spalding open, house the residents, show that we don&#39;t leave people behind, not when it&#39;s inconvenient, not when they&#39;re sick, and not when they need us the most. Thank you.</td>

                <td> Hello. Good evening. I&#39;ve spoken before several times. I just want to thank you guys for all of you elders for putting all this together and thinking it all through. And I listened to Madam Mayor last week and saying that what&#39;s coming with Trump and we can&#39;t fund a lot of these things right now. And I&#39;ve spoken with Ms. Nolan and I think you guys are putting your intellect with your heart. And Ms. Nolan said, it&#39;s $50,000 a bed. It&#39;s too much. But all this money that has been spent, the four years of the federal money, and then last year with the city money, I&#39;ve seen. So you&#39;re going to hear from other people, people with a brain aneurysm. and people with cancer. I had a brain tumor. And then getting back to life, and all this effort has been put in. So I just, analogy, if a parent is paying for three years of college, it would be silly not to pay for the fourth year. You guys got us this far. So many people, there&#39;s no, whatever these wet shelters are and 240 and all these things, It&#39;s fine, and it counts as a bet, but all the progress that I&#39;ve seen in people, it&#39;s just crazy. There was a person who, his wife died, he was a 40-year janitor at MIT, and then over a year processing his wife, and he&#39;s now housed. You&#39;re gonna hear stories of people that, lived in Cambridge for 18 years and were attacked in a cab. Another person, Mr. David, he&#39;s gotten connected with his son again and all of his life, and now he can look forward. All of us have gotten so much. I&#39;ve seen so much progress. All this money has been spent. Too much money, as no one would say. But too much money has been spent, but now... It&#39;s insane to then put people back in congregate shelter. We&#39;re ready to go. We&#39;re ready. We graduated. We are asking for priority for the housing vouchers, but I think it&#39;s a great way to... value the investment of all these years. It&#39;s really gotten so many people on the path forward, and it would be so silly to put people back. So I really appreciate all the intelligence and heart you put in, but this will finish it properly. Thank you so much.</td>

                <td> Good evening. Thank you for the opportunity of addressing you. My name is Tahar Sadiq. I&#39;m a lifelong resident of Cambridge. And I have become homeless. And June 7th will be three years. And I came to the Spalding house three years ago at the time of the girlfriend because I discovered that they were having couples. When I got there and I inquired about residence there, they told me that I hadn&#39;t been homeless long enough. I think it was about seven, eight months at the time. And so from that point on, me and my girlfriend were living in the street. staying at residence here and there whenever we could, friends, but that never lasts for long. So the majority of the time has been on the street. Well, I think maybe a little over two years ago, I had came back to the Spalding because I was told by some friends that I guess it was a little different there and I was single at that point. So I asked for some shelter for myself and they took my name and fortunately enough two weeks later I was called and told that they had a spot for me. I was there, I have been there for four months now and i don&#39;t know it&#39;s i i just i&#39;m under the impression that it&#39;s all going to come to an end very soon i have nowhere to go i have no no nothing um i i feel like it&#39;s just i&#39;m just going to be in the same situation i was in when i came there However, I have to say that Spalding House has been a refuge for me. They provided a roof over my head for this time that I&#39;ve had it. They provided some good counselors with great efforts to help me find places. But to this point, it&#39;s to no avail.</td>

I&#39;ve never been homeless until I lost my job and I got separated from my wife after 18 years of marriage. All I&#39;m asking for is a better place than TWC. Today, the director of TWC Spalding told me that I&#39;m leaving to 240 Albany tomorrow, which is inferior level compared to Spalding TWC. The vouchers are to be kept for the most in need. And I think I deserve a voucher. We deserve a voucher. I deserve a voucher specifically for my health condition, but we all need apartments. We all need permanent housing. Thank you.</td>

                <td> Hi, Michael Rogo, 65 Sparks. Lots of really important stuff up today, so I&#39;ll keep it brief. Harping on what I said last time, we do need more apartments. Regarding policy order number 68, we remain in crisis, and as Councillor Nolan said, 20% of zero is still zero. I trust the experts in CDD to continue to apply and search for answers, but please continue to keep up the press. More innocuously, for policy order number 70 regarding first floor retail, I think there&#39;s actually a very conservative change that could be made to add some vitality to our neighborhoods. My great-grandparents ran what would today be called a neighborhood bodega, but in their city of origin, as here, zoning today makes that illegal, just like it makes Patty&#39;s, Planet Records, Oleana, Black Sheep Market, etc., where they, should they need to change materially their buildings. So I think we can finesse the rules here in some minor way, and we actually can be pretty restrictive with, for example, restricting liquor licenses, I think, but I trust the experts. Anyway, and then on a similar note regarding policy order 69, having seen some numbers related to property taxes and the numbers involved to extend support, either for Spaulding or for the individuals there in the budget, I encourage you to use the finesse you have there too. Thank you, and please stay hydrated.</td>

                <td> yes hi dan totten 54 bishop allen drive and i just want to say it&#39;s come to my attention that there&#39;s a compromise that will affirm the closure of the transition wellness center while including a newfound one million dollars in housing vouchers for unhoused people this new funding is expected to serve approximately 25 people meaning that the city will now fund a total of six million dollars in municipal housing housing vouchers in this year&#39;s budget setting an important precedent that builds on years of collective advocacy. This is significant, but nonetheless, it is completely unacceptable that the Wellness Center will close without a transition plan beyond the streets or maybe the wet shelter for those who remain. The number of new vouchers and the number of Spaulding residents appear to be very close and yet the city is not necessarily planning to prioritize them with this new voucher money. I argue that this is a policy choice and I will make the case that we should do it. uh this is a choice that we&#39;re making to close this shelter we absolutely have the money to fund the shelter and y&#39;all are choosing not to fund it it is an embarrassing precedent to set the city should never take the extraordinary step of closing a homeless shelter whether permanently or for renovations without meeting the needs of the people affected. This principle should apply system-wide, including when 240 Albany Street is renovated as is rumored. It is reasonable to veer from the usual prioritization system under these unique emergency circumstances. These people are about to lose their shelter and they have nowhere to go. This is not about special treatment. It&#39;s about finishing what was started with the commitment that was made at the Transition Wellness Center. It literally has the word transition in its name. How could we not transition them to housing if we really must close the shelter? I sent the longer email, but I do want to take the last few seconds just to congratulate Clerk LeBlanc, first as a colleague and also as now as a member of the public. I found her to be an incredibly dedicated public servant, and I have tremendous respect for the work that she&#39;s done, and I wish her the best of luck with her next step. Thank you.</td>

                <td>Hello, everyone. I&#39;m here to support PO 70 for the first floor retail and residential neighborhoods. I want to speak about these shops and services that have been grandfathered in as non-conforming uses, such as the Blatcheet Market and Asaro Bakery are cornerstones of our community. They offer everyday conveniences and fosters local entrepreneurship. Yet with every redevelopment proposal, they face the real threat of displacement. I believe first floor retail isn&#39;t just nice to have. It meaningfully enhances walkability, reduces car dependency, and keeps vital amenities within easy reach of residents, as well as perfect pairing for the most recent multifamily zoning change. Despite overwhelming public support, these uses remain prohibited by right in our residential zoning districts, leaving our neighborhoods pretty barren I respectfully ask the council to amend our zoning code to allow first floor retail by right in residential areas, ensuring a balanced community, and in doing so will sustain the character, convenience, and economical vitality that makes Cambridge such a special place to live, work, and walk in, and hopefully improve that for future generations. Thank you.</td>

I&#39;d just given birth that year and I was a PhD student. So according to the words of one of the Cambridge Housing Authority people that I met, because I also needed housing at the time, I was an unprotected member of the society at the time. I mean, I know policy members, you know, you&#39;re looking on high and you&#39;re looking at populations and you&#39;re, you know, calling certain people homeless, certain people poor, but you know, that&#39;s, you know, that&#39;s not all our identity. I am a published author and I, teach at UMass Boston at Emerson adjunct. So again, the income doesn&#39;t really add up for me to afford housing in Cambridge and Boston. But Rise Up really helps me to bridge that gap, especially when I had very low income during that time. And you know, I teach very rich kids and I teach at risk kids. So I&#39;m very productive member of society and we all need a little help certain times to live to our fullest potential. And for women, especially income, that kind of income, $9,000 in pocket can help us to move away from abusive situations and abusive partners So income is directly related to emotional health, you know, physical health. And, you know, a healthy mother, you know, leads to healthy children and healthy communities. So please consider redoing Rise Up for women like me. Thank you.</td>

I&#39;m speaking in support of prioritizing new vouchers for residents of the Transitional Wellness Center at Spaulding, who are now being displaced by the compromise amendment on Charter Right Number 2, which now affirms the closure of the TWC. You&#39;ve already heard from residents of Spalding and I really implore you to listen to them. I and many others are horrified that the city has chosen to continue down this inhumane path of closing the shelter despite widespread support for the TWC from community members who spoke last week and in weeks prior. And I&#39;m extremely concerned that there is no transition plan for Spalding residents who are being suddenly displaced. The city cannot neglect the very residents it has chosen to displace by cutting funding for the TWC. Putting residents in this kind of emergency situation with no assurance of housing would constitute reckless endangerment of people&#39;s lives and of public health. The clear right thing to do is to ensure access to newly created housing vouchers for Spalding residents who the city has chosen to displace. To neglect this very basic obligation would be a violation of Cambridge&#39;s stated promise to be a sanctuary city. So again, I implore you to please listen to testimonies that you&#39;ve already heard from residents of Spalding and prioritize vouchers for these residents.</td>

As I said last week, I think it&#39;s critical that the city implement vouchers for formerly in-house people as well as mixed status families who are losing funding in CHA housing due to the federal HUD cuts. At the same time, I want to speak and support again of the residents at the Transition Wellness Shelter. I think ideally the shelter would stay open because it has served a very important purpose of providing supportive housing to these people as well as giving them a stable place they can be providing resources they need. At the same time, if the shelter were to close, I think it&#39;s important to prioritize vouchers for the residents who are currently there and who have not been placed somewhere else. I think it&#39;s really important that they be prioritized and be given housing and the support they need via voucher rather than being placed on the street and which would be extremely traumatic and difficult for those people. At the same time, I want to speak in support of Rise Up. I think it&#39;d be great to continue funding that as well. I want to use the last bit of my time to speak against Your number one, I frankly think it&#39;s extremely premature to be exploring reductions in inclusionary zoning requirements, especially since the council recently adopted massive changes to zoning. And I think it requires more time to see what the impact of those changes will be before.</td>

                <td>Hi, Aya Al-Zubi on 156 Magazine Street. Wanted to share thoughts on Charter Rights 1 and 2. First, thank you for moving forward on municipal vouchers, but it&#39;s incredibly disappointing that the city is closing TWC, and the more disappointing part of this is that there&#39;s no clear plan to transition the residents. It&#39;s not just not okay, it treats the residents inhumanely. So please use your voices and positions to care for the residents of TWC. We&#39;re simply asking for you to not completely turn your back to a closure the city&#39;s leadership is choosing to make. And please also support Rise Up too. Second, please do not push for a study on inclusionary zoning with what seems to be the intention to lower the threshold to 10% or less because we just decided to upzone with the 20% threshold. Like, what, y&#39;all? Like, real estate developers develop for profit. In a New York City Furman study on New York City affordable housing... on the units that opted out of affordability restrictions saw that on average, the neighborhoods that lost affordable units commanded asking residents about $400 more per month than residents in neighborhoods where affordable housing was preserved. So I sit with the nature of capitalism and banks that impose quote unquote difficulty on developers. But to me, that should be another clear indicator that leaning essentially only on capitalism as hope for solutions is like putting a pretty Band-Aid on top of a fire hydrant called the housing crisis. There&#39;s going to be a flood, and the people who get wiped out are people experiencing homelessness and low-income people who will be gentrified out of this community. If you want to fight Trump, you do it with love. You don&#39;t do it with cutting back on the communities that make this city what it is.</td>

I&#39;ve been there for about 10 months. And, you know, being able to shower and have a good night&#39;s sleep has enabled me to reconnect with my 15-year-old son.

And I&#39;ve been on the street before. I was on the street in 2015. And I ended up bouncing around ERs, emergency rooms. So if I&#39;m bouncing around emergency rooms again because I&#39;m on the street, then what will happen is my son&#39;s mother will take access away and then I&#39;ll be a broken man again.

                <td> Good evening, counselors. Lee Farris, Norfolk Street and the Port. I&#39;m speaking tonight for the Cambridge Residents Alliance in opposition to Charter Right number one about doing a study on reducing the percent of required inclusionary housing. Our organization fought long and hard to increase the inclusionary rate to 20%. I think Cambridge should wait and see what the results of the new upzoning will be. Councilors who supported the new upzoning did so based on believing CDD that the upzoning would result in a certain proportion of inclusionary housing. If we launch a study now, developers will simply wait until the study is complete to see whether the council decides to lower the required inclusionary percentage. We all know that the slowdown in housing starts is due more to high interest rates and increased construction costs than to inclusionary housing requirements. So if the council wants to consider lowering the amount of inclusionary housing, then I ask that you also consider putting the new upzoning on hold until the council decides what to do. That way, the council would have the opportunity to change their vote on the upzoning if need be. MEANWHILE, WE WOULD LOVE TO WORK WITH COUNSELORS AND THE MANAGER ON STARTING A SOCIAL HOUSING PROGRAM THAT COULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE NEW STATE SOCIAL HOUSING FUNDS. THAT WAY CAMBRIDGE COULD HAVE A NEW WAY TO BUILD MIXED INCOME HOUSING THAT RESULTS IN A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THE RESIDENCE ALLIANCE ALSO SUPPORTS PASSAGE OF CHARTER RIGHT NUMBER TWO, AS I SAID LAST WEEK, AND FUNDING OF THE FOUR ITEMS IN THE BUDGET. Given that, as I understand, the council and manager have reached an agreement for an additional $1 million, we ask that all the remaining people at Spaulding be assured of a good place to sleep, meaning not a wet shelter, including the chance to get a city voucher. Thank you.</td>

However, my remarks are not focused on the broader merits of the inclusionary zoning policy, but rather the pragmatic challenges facing the specific project at 24 Mass Ave, 2400 Mass Ave, I apologize, which I live directly across from. I&#39;m here to ask for flexibility and creative solutions to get this mature project back underway. As you know, the 2400 Mass Ave project proposal progressed through all the usual planning stages, not only gain approval, but also was ultimately lauded by this council as a case study worthy instance of collaboration between the development team, city planning, and the abutting community. We all appreciated the outcome and loved the kudos as well. It&#39;s fun to participate in those kind of experiences. But unfortunately, the delays at this junction are proving hugely unsettling to us in the community, as we had considered the project well underway, but now we seem to be in limbo. As such, I&#39;m asking for nothing more than to ask for the continued good faith collaboration among all parties to find a way to move this particular project forward. Thank you very much.</td>

And I understand that these are not responsibilities that typically fall on the city of Cambridge. But the core to all of this is government is not a thing that just happens. It&#39;s something that is practiced. And it&#39;s a relationship to each of our neighbors of every resident that lives here. And again, I understand this is not usually a city responsibility, but to extend those, that sort of help, that sort of trust to people, and then to withdraw it, not even because of insolvency, but a fear of future instability, right?</td>

Last week, I sat in this chamber and heard dozens of my neighbors speaking in favor of extending funding for the Transitional Wellness Center, Rise Up program, and municipal vouchers for 170 formerly unhoused or mixed status immigrant households. After hearing such a strong outpouring of support from the community, I was aghast. hearing the majority of the council make the hard choice to support only funding the vouchers and refusing to push for immediate continued funding for Rise Up and the Transitional Wellness Center. Many of you cited that these programs were not initially established as permanent programs as justification to cut them. In a city that does, in fact, have the money to continue funding them, that is a cop out. These are survival programs meeting critical needs and supported by the community. Cutting programs for vulnerable community members before alternatives are established, even with the intent to create or revive programs in the future, is abandoning those communities. It&#39;s like taking the donut off of a car that had a flat tire before a new tire is available. Sure, the donut was supposed to be temporary, but without any tire, the car isn&#39;t safe to drive. It&#39;s unconscionable in a city that has the level of wealth that we have. And it sends a message to everyone in Cambridge, particularly marginalized, targeted, and vulnerable residents, that our city will protect and support us only if we are deemed worthy, and that the support does not require too much effort. Tonight, I implore you to vote to support fully funding all of these programs as your constituents have asked. Thank you.</td>

Making hard decisions is when we most need to think about and act on our values. Do we truly value the well-being of our most vulnerable residents? I hear that a succession program to Rise Up is to be explored at a later date. Why would we abandon those in need during that time? Why not commit to funding it for one year while we figure out the long-term plan? These funds are a lifeline, not a bonus. If the cost of the Transition Wellness Center is too high, let&#39;s make a commitment to fixing that problem instead of closing a successful program. Whether it&#39;s finding a new space or working with Spalding on a mutually beneficial solution, we are a community filled with smart and compassionate people. This is a solvable problem. There are community members afraid to leave their homes right now. These include people who are legally allowed to be in the US. They are afraid to ask for help. They are afraid to access services. Taking away supports only validates their fears that we, in Cambridge, are not a safe place for them. Thank you.</td>

I speak with the Cambridge Housing Affordability Organizers and would like to express my support for starting with Charter Order 2, a stronger support for most vulnerable populations. Firstly, we are incredibly grateful for the members of the Council who have allied to support those who need it most. Unfortunately, we can&#39;t say that the recent decisions compromising houses individuals in the spa and shelter have aligned with these interests. in no way morally or logically should our interests be aligned with putting our most vulnerable populations in the most precarious situations especially during this time we cannot say that all individuals in cambridge have a right to basic medical financial and social support and in the same breath say that we should not afford housing vouchers for the displaced residents that line of support for those in the transitional shelter Now, and the hundreds that the shelter could have assisted in the future have already been taken away with the decisions to shut down Spalding. This decision is showing the red citizens of Cambridge who is left unprotected by the city. This is a complete misalignment of priorities, and the city cannot grow used to reducing support for the vulnerable. We are at the beginning of a presidential term that could lead to potentially a much worse financial situation. And personally, if this is who the city supports now, I personally do not want to know who the city will choose to protect in a year. We are very grateful for the support expressed for keeping Swahili culture open. Thank you.</td>

                <td> Hi, good afternoon. My name is Ruhi Udwania. I&#39;m a member of the Cambridge Housing Affordability Organizers and a student at Harvard. I&#39;m speaking in support today of a stronger version of Charter Right 2, advocating for its passage and asking that the city council and city manager fill in gaps. On April 10th and 17th, the public hearings convened by the Human Services and Veterans Committee supported allocating sufficient funds in the fiscal year 26 operating budget to sustain the emergency housing vouchers for permanent supportive housing, housing vouchers for mixed status households, the Transitional Wellness Center, and Rise of Cambridge. So I applaud the council for their commitment to provide vouchers for over 170 households at risk of losing housing due to the Trump administration&#39;s cuts, but the watered-down policy they have before them today, while it should be passed, does not provide support for all of these groups. As the Charter Right language itself says, preserving housing stability for these people is not only a humanitarian imperative, but also a fiscally responsible strategy that prevents the greater downstream costs associated with displacement and homelessness for these households. Additionally, the Transitional Wellness Center was created because of the COVID-19 pandemic and because the city&#39;s existing homeless shelters were not sufficient. From a public health perspective, COVID-19 is still affecting people today, with the most weekly deaths from COVID in Cambridge in the past year occurring just this February. So the shelter is mandatory to continue keeping open. It also included critical wraparound services, so closing of the shelter without a transition plan is unacceptable. It means people not only lose the shelter, but lose other services that were supporting their well-being. While I am one person speaking right now, there have been many other testimonies thus far touching on these issues, and the Cambridge Housing Affordability Organizer sent a communication earlier today with signatures from over 150 Harvard students and affiliates and Cambridge residents supporting all the policies that I&#39;ve discussed. Therefore, while passing Charter Right 2 is the bare minimum I ask this council to do right now to protect Cambridge citizens, I ask that you also pass Charter Right 1 and fill in the gaps that I&#39;ve mentioned. Lastly, my colleague Rishi Mohan was on the Zoom for public comment and was passed over, so he should be available if the</td>

I&#39;m calling to speak on Charter Right Number 2 and to express my disappointment at the Council&#39;s decision to close the Transitional Wellness Center at Spaulding without a plan in place for where the residents can go. Turning these people out of the shelter won&#39;t make them disappear and won&#39;t solve their problems. It will only push them towards crisis. What happens to people in this country when they&#39;re in crisis and have nowhere to go? They are criminalized, harassed, arrested, prosecuted, and often imprisoned. Since we&#39;re so concerned about the budget here, I&#39;ll just remind the council that the Commonwealth of Massachusetts spends over $300,000 a year on every person we incarcerate. To be clear, it would be unacceptable to lock people up simply if it was cheaper than helping them, but that isn&#39;t even the case. By my calculations, the Transitional Wellness Center, if it keeps even 20% of the people it serves out of jail, then it is actually saving money. In addition to the incalculable benefits of allowing people to live with freedom and dignity. And yes, I understand prisons are funded as part of the state budget outside the remit of this council, and it&#39;s not on the city&#39;s balance sheets. But if that&#39;s the best reason that you have for why closing the shelter is a fiscally prudent and therefore necessary thing to do, that&#39;s not good enough. Please prioritize the displaced residents from Spalding for the new housing vouchers. Thank you.</td>

                <td> Thank you. Suzanne Blier, Five Fuller Place. I want to begin with the financial crisis that we&#39;re having locally and nationally. And we as a city need to simply cut back. I can speak for the universities here. We&#39;re thinking 20% cuts. That&#39;s massive. Staffing, et cetera. Same thing probably with MIT and elsewhere. Ditto the hospitals. Biotech is in deep distress. We have a real financial crisis and the city needs to step up and consider cutbacks roughly along those lines of budget and staff if we&#39;re going to make it through this in some way. 20%, that&#39;s the element that matters tonight. You can&#39;t simply raise property values because that impacts housing costs for everyone, apartments and those on lower and fixed incomes. On housing needs now, a large number of our Cambridge and area employees likely will be decreasing in the months ahead as universities, hospitals, and biotechs do major cutbacks. The impacts of this will not be known until the summer or fall, and new housing requirements, requirements for new housing likely will shift downwards significantly, maybe even 15 or 20%. The council had a chance to include affordable housing inclusionary in the February 10th luxury housing proposal. Dropping that now is kind of like bait and switch because the petition proponents had advocated this as advancing housing affordability. I kind of agree with Lee Ferris, put the upzoning on hold if that&#39;s what you need to do. On the commercial in every neighborhood, that&#39;s a proper place of zoning. There are costs, water, electric, sewage, parking, congestion, noise. And that needs to be done in neighborhood planning. Note, it&#39;s really hard to keep a business going two years if it has gone away because a building was closed. Grandfathering works. Keep it. Charter right number two. I&#39;m really impressed with the Spalding people and others. This is a key group, and we need to support them. Thanks to Clerk LeBlanc. Thanks for honoring Pebble Gifford. She is still with us, and I know she would oppose the developer interests.</td>

And first off, I just want to talk about the retail policy order saying that mixed use is going to save the city. And I think we ought to at least keep an open mind. There are time, place and use restrictions and all kinds of uses in the city. And we ought to take a look at that. Central Square has been a great incubator for small businesses, and we ought to be able to have that flourish throughout. I do find it interesting that our revolution doesn&#39;t want you guys to look at a study. I think unfortunately for us right now, we&#39;re in a time where extremists kind of run the country. And they also run the dialogue. Developers aren&#39;t your enemy. You&#39;ve been tricked into feeling that way. You&#39;ve been tricked into thinking that way because of an ideology, not reality. If you look at the 20% inclusionary bump in 2017 and look at the parcels that have been built after that, you haven&#39;t had hardly any under 20% built. And in fact, you exempted all the large developers when you did the jump because they told you it couldn&#39;t work. You know, the emperor has a little bit of no clothes when it comes to inclusionary zoning in Cambridge, and I kind of wonder if this program ever worked as advertised. Units that are counted as inclusionary, Mass of Maine, for instance, that&#39;s not an inclusionary project. Shame on you. You also listed, you know, I sent a copy of the development log. Um, you know, of the, you know, Dan said, Boris spoke earlier and of that development, you can get about 15% of it. That&#39;s actually materialized. So if we can&#39;t even agree as to what the data is, we need to take a stop, a breather, uh, go through it and come back and take a hard look at it. We&#39;re at odds with each other. We&#39;re here to build housing for the city. We&#39;re here to work with the city. But we want to work based on the facts, not some fiction that you&#39;re being sold by an ideology that&#39;s just absolutely broken. Take a look at the data, look at what&#39;s been built. You tell me if those are actually inclusionary buildings, both under 20% or 80%. Thank you.</td>

                <td> Hey, my name is Jacob, and I live on Magazine Street here in Cambridge. I&#39;m here to support the people in the Spaulding Center. I have never really done any public comment before I learned about the Transition Wellness Center at Spaulding, but when I was hearing from the impacted residents of the shelter, it made it clear just how important it was to support them. The people here are neighbors in Cambridge. They had trusted the city to help them transition to a more stable situation, and for a moment, Cambridge responded with, Really an exemplary model of what a shelter could look like. Something that gave residents the stability they needed to find jobs and reconnect with their families, as they&#39;ve told us. That&#39;s why I&#39;m heartbroken and upset that not only will the Spalding Center close, but it will close without an adequate transition plan for the residents there. It&#39;s critical that the million dollars in vouchers that were outlined in the most recent policy order prioritize these residents. When Cambridge had opened the Transition Wellness Center, it made a commitment and investment to help the people there find a better place. And the word transition is in its name. if the city goes through with closing the shelter without any kind of plan for its residents it&#39;s going back on what it promised our fellow cantabrigians it is heartbreaking to me that the city would even consider closing a homeless shelter without ensuring that its residents would be fully supported throughout and it&#39;s fully possible for the vouchers to be allocated to spalling residents just based on how other vouchers of the program are being directed to specific to specific families and individuals It is so within reach to do what we can to honor the commitment that we made as a city. And I call on you one more time to do right by them and ensure that they are prioritized with these vouchers. Thank you for your time.</td>

It is inexcusable to displace people and leave them with no good options. When the fire headquarters budget went from $25 million to $77 million, the money was there. We found $50 million for extravagant historic renovations, including putting a slate roof on the building, but we can&#39;t find a way to put a roof over the head of 25 vulnerable people. Where are our priorities? On a lighter note, please support first floor retail. It moves amenities closer to where people live. This makes neighborhoods more vibrant. It reduces traffic. It also helped diversify our tax base. These properties are taxed at twice the residential rate and they don&#39;t have a homestead exemption. Thank you very much.</td>

As it says in the resolution, she has done a wonderful job and I will miss her tremendously. She is leaving big shoes to fill. With respect to using city-owned parking, I keep being tremendously amused by the completely erratic nature of this city&#39;s attitude towards parking. So come up with something, people do need it. And with respect to inclusionary zoning and our budget, I commend to all of you the really well done memo from Claire Spinner about our tax levy limit, the budget and how all of this works with prop two and a half. As far as inclusionary zoning is concerned, I would love to see a study done by the city of Cambridge that I would actually believe because too many studies and too many numbers that are given to us just vary based on the conclusion that&#39;s desired instead of reality. And all of the people who say, oh, I believe everything that comes out of the city are people who haven&#39;t had to deal with the consequences of it. So when we were told that inclusionary zoning would flourish, and everything was going to be wonderful. We didn&#39;t think about real numbers. We didn&#39;t think about the MBTA Communities Act. We didn&#39;t think about data. We didn&#39;t think about reality. So why don&#39;t we try a little of that just for a change? Thank you.</td>

                <td>Thank you. Appreciate it. James Williamson, North Cambridge. I, first of all, would like to second what Heather said about the clerk. She was very nice to me. She said something nice to me, which is kind of rare in the city. She appreciated the fact that I asked if I could be heard during public comment. So anyway, thank you for your kindness. On the closing of the shelter, there is a friend of mine who moved into the Burns apartment buildings where I live, who had lived there for a while and told me about it. And it seems like it&#39;s a really nicer place to be than, say, Bay Cove. There&#39;s some privacy. There were fans. some meals provided. There was a curfew, but it was more relaxed, less draconian. I think there were many things about it that seemed like this is something that actually works. So when we have something that works, why are we shutting it down? Especially if there&#39;s, you know, there are apparently over 20 people for whom there still can&#39;t be found alternative housing which of course i suppose is preferable but in the meantime we&#39;ve got something that works and for people who complain about the money i mean they&#39;re doing something with linear park that&#39;s seven million dollars and it&#39;ll probably be ten by the time they&#39;re done which almost nobody who lives in the area want i mean why don&#39;t we cut into some of the bike you know bs budget to help people who are homeless with a project that works um until we find more permanent housing. And as for the inclusionary zoning, it really should be more than 20%. The last study said it could be 25%. Everybody touts how much, how great it is, how it works, how it&#39;s a model. I prefer other social housing approaches, but I mean, come on, 20% is a minimum. Thank you, James. Thank you.</td>

There is especially no justification to lower the number of inclusionary units. There are many approaches to housing that we could explore. The deference to construction and real estate interest over community needs is unacceptable. Next topic. While I believe additional flexibility regarding allowing some additional business use in residential neighborhoods will be welcome and actually is kind of an exciting idea, it is not possible that there has been a sufficient community outreach or consideration of this issue. Please get community buy-in and have a mechanism for review to address any issues that may come up if this is instituted. THIRD TOPIC, I WANT TO ENCOURAGE FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY IN EVERY MATTER. AND FOURTH, SHELTER SERVICES ARE ESSENTIAL.</td>

                <td>ALEX STEINBERG, 3 CLINTON STREET. HAVEN&#39;T BEEN HERE IN A WHILE. We did, I&#39;m actually what they call a real estate developer. But anyway, in 1989, we did a 27% voluntary affordable housing project at Cambridge Port Commons. Built 100 units, 27 affordable units. We lost some money on it. So we guessed that 27% was probably too high. How much affordable housing we should have, I think, should be part of the city housing plan and population growth. Do we want to be 250,000 people in 10 years or do we want to be 150,000 people? And what percentage do we want to be affordable? I think if we stick our necks out on that, then some of the rest of the plan will be a little easier. and what income levels we want that should be part of it the plan because varying the income levels is very important in getting it to the housing amounts um so you know the the most of the affordable housing oops i&#39;m i&#39;m going way too slow so i&#39;ll skip most of it most of the affordable housing is done by the Nonprofits and the Affordable Housing Trust, they&#39;re on track. Inclusionary is sort of a secondary thing. It&#39;s really a tax. It&#39;s like a local tax. It works that way. So the higher the increase in the tax rate, the less production you get. What I think you should do instead of a study is just do an experiment. Drop the rate. 20% is just too high. Everybody knows it. Drop the rate to maybe 15 or 10% for a two-year period. See if that works. Thank you.</td>

                <td> Justin Safe, 259 Hurley Street. I continue to support increasing funding for the housing budget in the form of the city manager&#39;s proposed federal stability fund. The current amount of the proposed fund is too small to address all of the current vulnerabilities that have already been identified, including spotting on the rise in housing vouchers and much too small in light of the federal administration&#39;s further budget cuts that we know will come in this fiscal year, including likely to section 8 vouchers. Cambridge can afford to and must protect the most vulnerable among us who face the greatest threat. We have around $200 million in Prop 2.5 cap space, the envy of every other municipality. We are also increasing our budget by more than expected inflation in other areas. On another note, on IZ, I strongly support the overdue and already mandated study, and it seems clear that we face a challenge here. My understanding is that not counting the Blue Garage Ebersource project, only one or two IZ projects have been permitted or opened in 2023 or 2024. The CDD report on recent IZ projects includes ones that were tied to large lab developments like 50 Rogers Street that can&#39;t really fairly be compared to purely residential home building. Last June, in reviewing our current IZ regime, MIT urban economist Carl Seidman found that no scenario is financially feasible under existing market conditions. The expectations for market conditions do not appear to be improving any time in the near future or the distant future. And my understanding is that unless the city takes action, we&#39;ll lose hundreds of homes. The city will not be able to make up for the dozens of lost inclusionary homes any other way, certainly not given them any other challenges we face. Look how challenging the stability fund has been. In fact, 2400 Mass Ave is already using public funding. Does that count as social housing? We need to figure out how to make these home building proposals work and to maximize the number of inclusionary homes while ensuring projects move forward, whatever it takes. Thank you.</td>

I just wanted to say that I think it&#39;s great that we passed this, but I do remain concerned that buyers of property should be alerted about areas that regularly flood in advance of purchase. So many of us have received many calls, texts, and emails from a resident on Lakeview Avenue where the water table is very, very high. But they&#39;re not in the 100-year flood area, so construction is allowed there. But my concern is that the developer is selling off lots pre-construction in an area that is known to flood. A neighbor has sent us a video. a very very the very very wet area and i just hate to be the buyer of a two million dollar home there that floods when even though it&#39;s not in the hundred year flood zone that that we know it&#39;s going to happen it&#39;s been documented it happens all the time you know so i just think that is concerning um And I don&#39;t know quite what to do about it, but I hope we&#39;ll think about how, you know, maybe I understand that if you are in the 100-year flood area, that&#39;s in the deed and you&#39;re notified and it&#39;s part of the building permit. But this property isn&#39;t in the 100-year flood area, but the water table is very high and everybody&#39;s basement floods and we&#39;re allowing building there.</td>

                <td> I believe there would be willingness to host folks to see the tunnel. We&#39;ve had a couple of conversations with the Harvard Square Business Association. There is excitement. I think the concept is very interesting. Certainly, when we think about revitalizing our squares, having these in-person venues, entertainment venues is a big part of what draws people in. And that&#39;s really the lifeblood of a lot of the businesses. This has been a challenge to get the yes on. I believe that&#39;s why we&#39;re seeing this here. I&#39;ve expressed concern that the $72,000 is not a huge amount, but it&#39;s really about a long-term picture of what the funding of such a project would look like. So I would say that Getting to an RFP for $72,000 seems reasonable. The challenge is that actually conducting an engineering study of the tunnel would probably run closer to, I believe, $500,000 to a million dollars pretty conservatively. And the question of who would fund that is unanswered at this point in time. I&#39;ve also had really, I will say I&#39;ve appreciated the engagement from the business association to actually try to sketch out what the economics would be of a theater space or a performance venue in the tunnel. I have concerns regarding whether the overall capital cost would justify that the economics would work out. I have concerns that the significant capital cost and risk would mean that it would be very difficult to bring private capital into a project like this and ultimately it would have to be publicly funded or there would have to be a pretty significant donation. So I am skeptical that the economics would stand alone and that we would be able to bring private capital in. There would be some request to the MBTA in order to allow access to the tunnel to do any sort of engineering study. That&#39;s something else that we would have to bridge. And obviously, I have in my mind the work that we&#39;ve done on the kiosk, which is how many square feet? small, it was small and that was just a really difficult project and that was above ground and so that&#39;s kind of where we are in terms of this proposal. I&#39;m happy if we ultimately want to have continued conversations. I feel like we are certainly in a position where we would love to place bets and think about exciting new projects, but we&#39;re also in a time where, as we&#39;ve been discussing, we don&#39;t have unlimited funding to place bets, and this one I would be concerned about from an economic perspective.</td>

But I would say the MBTA certainly has its hands full. I don&#39;t know, that&#39;s ultimately a request that we would have to prioritize relative to the many other things we&#39;re working on the MBTA with.

I mean, I think the other thing to bear in mind is that, and you&#39;ll have this before you before the end of this week, when we talk about public investment and Harvard Square is that there&#39;s a proposal to look at a traffic study associated with perhaps pedestrianizing a portion of Harvard Square. And so that&#39;s something I think that perhaps may be very helpful to the business community in terms of enlightening the square as well and something that we&#39;ve been talking about to the business association as well. And so there are a number of things that are ongoing here in the square. And so again, I think I think we have a somewhat skeptical attitude in terms of the tunnel. It&#39;s a long-term, really significant investment project. And while I recognize that there is excitement in the business association about something this different, this is just literally the start of a more significant investment in terms of sort of proving this out in terms of it being vote viable from an engineering perspective, from an access perspective, from a code perspective, and indeed as an entertainment value in the long term.</td>

If you haven&#39;t been down in the tunnel, that&#39;s one thing, but if you certainly get the chance, I&#39;m sure that Ms. Gilson from the Harvest Group Business Association would show you the... you know the it&#39;s not powerpoint but it&#39;s the the the mock-up and and sort of the ideas that they have for this and it would be incredibly cool um you know i i think i i i think the concerns um that you raise mr manager are reasonable concerns i don&#39;t think this would be a cheap uh a cheap project um but we&#39;re not you know the order is not asking for the city nor i think would anyone ask for the city to fund all of the infrastructure and everything else to you know to do this but we don&#39;t know what the possibilities might be and who might be willing to step up whether it&#39;s a live nation or you know some some company like that until we do the initial step and and get an rfp out and have somebody go in and take a look at it and see if it&#39;s even feasible I mean, they might come back and say, no, and then we can put this whole thing to bed and think of maybe something else to do with the space. But until we do that, this is just going to keep going round and round and round and round and round. I hope we pass this. I think this is a first step, and I know that we have, as Deputy City Manager, you mentioned we have about $300,000 or so set aside to do a pedestrian study in Harvard Square. Maybe this money comes out of that, and it&#39;s already budgeted, or maybe a piece of it comes out of that. I don&#39;t know. But in any case, I think it&#39;s worth doing, and I think it&#39;s worth seeing what the potential for that space would be. Thank you.</td>

I think, Vice Mayor, I would probably say that if we are to commit to $72,000 toward drafting an RFP, I would request that the council think and that the HSBA... help us understand where the funding for an engineering study might come from. My concern would be if that in our conversations thus far that hasn&#39;t been clear, in which case it may just be a request really for $72,000 to then come back to this body with essentially no more information except for the fact that we now need to do a $500,000 or $1 million engineering study. um i would note you know when i think about fiscal responsibility some of it is also just understanding you know as we spend small amounts of money that lead to medium or large amounts of money we should just be thinking about what that long-term outcome we are shooting for is how likely it is to actually turn into what we desire and i would say even with the mbta some of these are not financial asks but ultimately they are There&#39;s a number of things that we really do need out of the MBTA. If we want to make this one of them, then that&#39;s a conversation that we can have. But I would think also about how we&#39;re prioritizing where we want their attention focused and how this fits into the broader priorities that we have as a community.</td>

                <td>Thank you, Madam Mayor. I&#39;m very much in agreement with what the city manager is saying. The reason I supported this is for asking the city leadership to sit with the Harvard Square Business Association and discuss this. I know you&#39;ve had some discussions. Maybe we want to add and the MBTA because I agree that if the MBTA has absolutely no interest in ever allowing the city or Harvard Square Business Association or any private developer to go down there and do anything, then I wouldn&#39;t want to invest the money. So this is really about having a meeting with them, considering, I will say that almost as soon as the draft budget was released, a call came in from the Harvard Square Business Association saying, why are we spending $300,000? on a pedestrian study. So they seem to think that it&#39;d be more worthwhile to invest here. So I&#39;m not asking that you definitely do this. I&#39;m asking that you meet with them. And if you as city manager and the staff feel it&#39;s worth looking into. One thing I will say in my meeting with folks from the Harvard School of Business Association, they also pointed out, and correct me if I&#39;m wrong, yes, the property&#39;s owned by the MBTA, but there&#39;s a lot that we as the city probably need to know about this property and our access to it and various other things for us as a city to make decisions about it, whether it becomes a shopping mall nightclub or something else so there&#39;s a little bit of you know we probably need to do some more digging and asking about what the you know the various things are involved with this property so i won&#39;t do it now but i&#39;m perfectly open to a possible amendment definitely including the mbta as part of this discussion and instead of it being facilitate the release, consider investing $72,000, et cetera, but I won&#39;t make that motion at this time.</td>

                <td> Thank you. I do agree this is a really exciting project. There have been conversations about it. This is not instead of pedestrianization. We have talked about that. The council has passed about six orders asking for greater opening up of Harvard Square. The Harvard Square Business Association has endorsed that. We have worked strongly over five years maybe as long as this tunnel but that&#39;s much further along it&#39;s also in some ways complicated but it&#39;s also much easier because it is about finding a way to pedestrianize parts of harvard square we have worked also to identify specific roads in a way that will be less disruptive so i i also agree that maybe we don&#39;t need the full 300 000 for that that we can do a traffic study Hopefully that will save some money there and we&#39;re still also many of us are still hoping that and I know I&#39;ve talked with the executive director of Gilson that we&#39;re still going to be able to do some kind of pilot this summer in anticipation to do proof of concept for For that so I I don&#39;t think these are at odds with each other But I do think obviously since we don&#39;t own this land in the Harvard Square Business Association doesn&#39;t own the land that it would be prudent to ensure that THE ACTUAL DECISION MAKERS ARE AT THE TABLE AS THE RFP IS DISCUSSED, SO I WOULD CERTAINLY SUPPORT COUNSELOR TONER&#39;S AMENDMENT TO SAY MEET WITH THE LEADERSHIP AND THE MBTA JUST SO THAT WE&#39;RE ALL ON THE SAME PAGE AS THIS POSSIBLY MOVES FORWARD WITH THIS EXCITING CONCEPT. SO THAT&#39;S WHAT I, AGAIN, I LOOK FORWARD TO IT. I KNOW HARVARD SQUARE PROPERTY OWNERS ARE VERY EXCITED ABOUT US MOVING FORWARD FINALLY WITH the study of and seeking to pedestrianize. I know there&#39;s a couple blocks already that are underway of being discussed, smaller blocks off the main drag. But this particular one in the heart of Harvard Square, we&#39;ll talk about it perhaps at the budget meeting on this Wednesday, not even Thursday. But this is something that, as I understand it, is saying let&#39;s move forward and see if the feasibility study can happen.</td>

And Councilor Wilson had indicated, laid it on the table to make sure that we get more of a communication. There was a recognition by a couple of us at the time that in a way a lapse in the policy order it only identified one school as asking for a specific response and yet we know with particularly the Broadway parking and some other projects going around the city and we have a school building under construction that the community I think the council&#39;s often thought and maybe assumed that the city would be providing for some kind of after-hours use for not just the school buildings but maybe other city parking lots as well So this kind of corrects for that lapse and says let&#39;s look at all of our buildings to see if there&#39;s a way that we can work on this. And I also neglected in the middle of our budget hearing last week, Councilor Siddiqui had said that she would support this and so I&#39;d like her to be added to the council order. So I just want to explain why it was that we were bringing this forward at this time to add to the one that was already on the table.</td>

Well, Mr. Alpert is sending it over to Ms. Stephan. A couple of things. As you know, there was an earlier order that asked about using the Cambridge Street parking facility, which is under the Cambridge Street Schools, and that request has gone to the Buildings and Grounds Subcommittee of the School Committee for them to take it up as a part of their discussion, because although And this particular policy order says confer with the school department. The school department doesn&#39;t necessarily mean the school committee. And so the amendment that I&#39;m asking is that we add school committee. I will be sending them a copy of this policy order so they&#39;ll know what we&#39;re asking of them. And I believe there&#39;s a meeting... set but I&#39;m not sure but they haven&#39;t had it yet and so we can add this to the discussion hopefully after the school committee has discussed it we may want to even consider having a round table to talk about between both bodies and so is that ready to go up it&#39;s just adding the school committee I can&#39;t see it so I&#39;m just going to have to go by what someone&#39;s telling me so if there&#39;s no is there any discussion about amending Okay, no discussion, no problem with it then. Let&#39;s vote this amendment.</td>

The City Manager is requested to confer with the Community Development Department to develop a timeline for the next Inclusionary Housing Study, explore revenues to address the lack of housing starts, and provide for consideration draft amendments to the Inclusionary Housing Ordinance, and explore other incentives to encourage developers to include affordable units beyond the requirements voluntarily.

                <td> Thank you, Mayor Simmons. Through you, so we shared some information on recent new development in the inclusionary housing program in response to some questions that had come in last week after last week&#39;s discussion of the policy order. just provide information on how new units have been brought into the inclusionary housing program over the last few years and then more generally as we look at the inclusionary housing program we have a number of ways in which new affordable units are brought into that including the inclusionary zoning ordinance which is section 11 200 OF THE ZONING ORDINANCE, SIMILAR ZONING PROVISIONS THAT ARE MORE PROJECT SPECIFIC. AS YOU KNOW, THE IZO WAS AMENDED IN 2017, SO WE WANTED TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT NEW UNITS THAT WE&#39;VE SEEN SUBJECT TO PROVISIONS THAT WERE IN PLACE PRIOR TO 2017 AND THOSE PROVISIONS THAT WERE CHANGED IN 2017. Started just with some information about how the program has grown over the last 25 years. The inclusionary ordinance was first adopted in 1998. It required 15% of units subject to a density bonus that ended up reducing that 15% to roughly 11 to 13%. And you can see on this slide how the program has grown over that time as units have been added in new market buildings. Over that time, the next slide gives you a sense as to the activity and how units have been added. Again, over that 25-year period, looking at development cycles, some years you can see that there are a lot of units that were added, some years as few as zero. We&#39;ve also included on this slide information about the number of developments that were approved these units are counted at the time the building permits issued or in the earliest years at the time that the inclusionary plan was approved and you can see we&#39;ll zero in on this a little bit later but the more recent years we&#39;ve seen more volatility in the last couple years that the numbers are down So the next slide is information on the type of inclusionary requirement or the type of zoning based requirement that has resulted in the production of affordable units that are part of our inclusionary housing program. You can see we&#39;ve grouped them into a number of different categories starting with A few units, 38 units, 35 units that were in place subject to permitting requirements that were adopted prior to the passing of the inclusionary ordinance in 1998. The largest majority is, of course, the units that are subject to the inclusionary ordinance that was in place prior to 2017, given the amount of time, number of years that that those provisions were in place and the fact that those provisions continue to apply to developments that have received permits prior to that change. So we are still seeing developments, new developments subject to the provisions that were in place prior to 2017 produce new units while those multi-year projects are built out. We have on here indicated the number of developments or the number of units that have been produced through the inclusionary ordinance subject to the 2017 changes along with those that we would call project specific changes which there are four or five large PUD projects which have project specific affordable housing requirements that again are in a separate part of the zoning ordinance and in some cases are modeled after the inclusionary ordinance or in some cases preempted the 20% change a couple of those where the 20% requirement was put in place for certain projects prior to the adoption of the 20% in the ICO itself And so next slide just shows these are the three ways in which we&#39;re seeing most units come into the inclusionary housing program now. We have one unit that came under a BZA permit over the last couple years, but the majority of the units that we&#39;re seeing now are coming through these three mechanisms in the zoning ordinance. And looking forward, next slide. WE&#39;RE NOW LOOKING AT THE ACTIVITY SINCE FY18. THE INCLUSION ORDINANCE WAS CHANGED IN 2017 AND YOU CAN SEE THAT THE PRODUCTION HAS BEEN VOLATILE SINCE THAT TIME AND OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS HAS BEEN DOWN AND WE&#39;VE INCLUDED IN HERE BOTH THE INFORMATION ON UNITS THAT WE HAVE SEEN GET TO THE PERMIT STAGE YEAR BY YEAR AS WELL AS THE UNITS BY TYPE OF INCLUSIONARY HOUSING REQUIREMENT ON THE RIGHT. IN ALL WE HAVE SEEN 576 UNITS COMMENCE CONSTRUCTION THROUGH A RANGE OF DIFFERENT ZONING REQUIREMENTS THERE. THE NEXT SLIDE IS A LIST OF DEVELOPMENTS THAT ARE INCLUDED IN THAT PRIOR SLIDE. THIS IS THE LIST OF DEVELOPMENTS THAT WE HAVE SEEN ACHIEVE THE BUILDING PERMIT STAGE AND ENTER CONSTRUCTION. MOST OF THESE UNITS AS NOTED ARE COMPLETE. SOME ARE STILL UNDERWAY. And then the last slide we have was just some information about where we are with preparation for the next inclusionary housing study where we do have funding in the FY26 budget for a new inclusionary housing study. We are underway preparations to commission that study. Key pieces of that study will be updating our socioeconomic diversity analysis to look at changes in the community. that underpin the inclusionary ordinance. The economic feasibility analysis, which you&#39;re hearing a lot about, the study that we did in 2016 looked at seven different development prototypes and tested those against a range of varying inclusionary housing requirements to look at the impact and the feasibility of those across that range. We will also update The legal analysis that underpins the inclusionary ordinance working with the law department and ask the consultant team that we select to look at recommending policy options, looking at best practices and inclusionary from other jurisdictions around the country. So we&#39;re preparing for that now want to talk with you all about that and are happy to put together more information But wanted to just provide that high-level overview of where we are and then just for reference we&#39;ve included some information about the 2016 study in the 2017 amendments just From a timeline perspective to give an indication of what that process looked like when we did this at that point So happy to answer any questions</td>

                <td> Through you, Mayor Simmons. Yes, that&#39;s a ratio of the units of the IHP units to the total units. I should note though that the 2017 changes to the ordinance changed the methodology for the inclusionary component from a unit based requirement to a GFA. So in some cases, the nominal percentage of units may vary from the floor area. We are under the 2017 changes, there&#39;s more flexibility so that we are able to identify larger units in some cases. So there will be fewer units but the same amount of floor area. So if it&#39;s a 15% requirement, it may be 14% of units. If it&#39;s a 20% requirement, it might be 18% of units.</td>

So when you see those that are noted as being subject to the 2017 revisions, those would either be a 15% of floor area requirement or a 20% of floor area, depending on when the permits were issued.</td>

That would take a bit of time. The study itself would probably take at least six to eight months, depending on the team. And one of the things that we&#39;d be looking for when we did procurement was a schedule from the consultant last time you can see it to take over a year i think it can be done more quickly than that certainly if we model what we had done and learned from the process last time and have a discussion in advance about what we&#39;re studying and what we&#39;re looking at particularly in regard to the development prototypes that we want them to look at feasibility for i think it can be done more quickly but we won&#39;t be able to say with full clarity until we have a study team on board and are really talking with the folks that would do it</td>

There&#39;s no internal trigger? It&#39;s not something that the counselors, let me speak to myself, I didn&#39;t program my calendar for three years in advance to say time to do an inclusionary study. So that we don&#39;t come in this place again, is there no lever, any trigger that says it&#39;s time to do it again?</td>

                <td> Thank you, Madam Mayor. Um, so I wanted to take a step back for a moment. You know, the initial proposal called for, you know, something done in 30 days, that would be temporary relief. I think that my feelings was that was a little bit too quick, given you know, all the options out there and how important inclusionary is. So me and my co-sponsors put forward a proposal to start the work in January or to hear back by January. I think that we have a compromise proposal that&#39;s brought forth with you with an October timeline. I think that, you know, A, in some extent, we don&#39;t need to do the full study like for 2400 Mass Ave, it&#39;s done with the Cambridge Redevelopment Authority, which we work very deeply and closely with. And there&#39;s a lot of trust there so that we can get raw numbers. And I will say in general that there&#39;s a lot of opportunities and places to look around for options in that I myself, my first option would not be to lower inclusionary from 20% to 10%. There&#39;s many other cities that have dealt with this and have found other interesting solutions. Baltimore is my favorite example where they just fully fund their inclusionary through tax abatements. And so they get all the affordable units and they get the buildings built. And tax abatements typically don&#39;t have that much of an economic cost because like the buildings otherwise would not be built so i think that there&#39;s a lot of creative solutions i would just like to suggest our amendment by substitution i think um counselor nolan and counselor toner might also have further amendments which in general i think are fine i think it doesn&#39;t hurt to try to do a study in like four or five months see what initial data we get back with and see if there&#39;s something that we can reach consensus to um by the end of the year um and try on that more ambitious timeline thank you</td>

                <td>Through you, Ms. Simmons. If I could offer maybe a clarification, I would say where some of our conversations have been is there&#39;s the update to the 2016 Inclusionary Housing Study, which we are proceeding with, and as Director Cotter noted, has a longer timeline. but then parts of the body are expressing they would like to see recommendations or potential actions before we&#39;re able to bring back a more comprehensive inclusionary housing study. I would note I think the inclusionary housing study is primarily there as a legal requirement because raising the inclusionary requirement is seen as potentially too burdensome for housing production. And so the inclusionary housing study is required mainly and was used back in 2016 mainly as justification for saying that a higher inclusionary requirement was still economically feasible for the production of housing. So in this case, given the context of this conversation where counselors are saying that there is potentially interest in either lowering the inclusionary requirement or finding other ways to fund it, I think the inclusionary housing study may not be a legal necessity. So lowering it doesn&#39;t require a study. Raising the inclusionary requirement requires a study. The challenge may be then, well, what do we lower it to? What are the policy options? I think if this amendment passes, I think we would ultimately probably want to confer a little internally, but we could think about what level of policy recommendation we could bring back by October 2025. This wouldn&#39;t incorporate a full economic analysis of the development environment, but we could at least have some kinds of both legal analysis on the different policy options that could provide different kinds of funding mechanisms for inclusionary, and we could also think about where we would potentially land in terms of other ways of structuring the inclusionary requirement compared to what we have today.</td>

But as the City Manager said, that was my understanding too, is if we&#39;re trying to go above 20 we definitely need the legal justification and financial justification for that but if we wanted to make uh changes so we made it easier to build that that&#39;s something we can we can do going forward so i&#39;m very interested in hearing uh what suggestions and recommendations we might be able to get by the fall if it includes zoning recommendations you know great but if it doesn&#39;t but it helps us you know, meet the goals that we say we have, and to also keep a couple of what look like really great projects alive and moving forward, then that&#39;s my hope with moving forward on this process. And again, the specificity was to, you know, just make sure we get things rolling. Thank you, Madam Mayor Yield.</td>

So I&#39;m wondering, timing-wise, do we want, I mean, can we make good decisions about how to proceed going forward if the impacts don&#39;t hit us. We won&#39;t know if the impacts are going to, you know, we never know what&#39;s going to happen every day, right? But the thought is that, you know, if Harvard is cutting back 20%, if MIT is reducing $100 million of its budget, if all these grants are going away it seems like we&#39;ll start feeling the pain in the fall so the question is um can a study project the pain we won&#39;t actually know we&#39;re going to be in pain until we&#39;re there and then the other question is just with the time line what i don&#39;t understand is so if you it would take 60 days So it would have to be July 1st before you could submit a procurement requisition, right? But you could draft the RFP and then send it out. Then it would take 60 days. So it could be out in September. And then we would have a report by like February, March. Is that right? Do I understand that correctly? Is that the timeframe? And do you think that would allow for the economic impact that we&#39;re anticipating to occur so that this study can actually reflect reality. That&#39;s my concern.</td>

                <td> Thank you. Through you, Mayor Simmons. So to your first point, Councilor Zizzi, on the time frame. So yes, we would expect to begin the procurement early in FY26 as soon as practical. It would require some work with other departments, so I don&#39;t want to speak on behalf of other departments that would be involved in the procurement but certainly i think we would say it would be a priority to get that out and to get a study team identified again the length of the study would be determined by the team that&#39;s making the proposal we would expect it to be in the say six to eight month range but i think we won&#39;t know with certainty until we identify teams and have proposals in front of us and that could be something that we make a consideration as we look at this but we do want to make sure that we get the right study so that we&#39;re set up with the appropriate information going forward and as the manager noted we can look at some of the other policy options in the intervening time while we&#39;re working on that study to your other question I don&#39;t know that the any study team is going to be able to reasonably predict the future and certainly given the uncertainty that we&#39;re looking at now however what we would expect is that part of the study would be having the team interview developers and interview folks that are involved in development lenders funders to both understand the current landscape what things are looking at comps a development that has happened in cambridge or in comparable areas in the region and then getting the best information they can from folks that are involved with development to project forward and to use that and when we did the 2016 study it was admittedly a very different time economically but Given that it was a very good part of the cycle, the development of the study team did temper the expectations a bit by changing some of the assumptions to try to account for that. And so that might be something that they would do to give a little bit more conservative projections looking forward, recognizing some of the uncertainty to build some of that in. But again, that would be something we&#39;d look at specifically with the team once they&#39;re identified.</td>

So I guess I&#39;m just asking the direct question. We could do a study and get the information that we need, but what is it that these projects actually need so that they can be breaking ground and doing what they got to do?</td>

I do think that at the end of the day, we do know directionally that economically it&#39;s a lot harder to get these projects to pencil out. We wouldn&#39;t be able to answer more precisely how much the movement these policy options are recommend, you know, we wouldn&#39;t be able to answer how much movement these policy options would get toward making projects viable without the more comprehensive study, but we could certainly know that we&#39;re moving in a direction. And I think we could also consider how we may incorporate some higher level understanding of how much impact we&#39;re going to have on these kinds of projects. And so I think this is probably the bifurcated option where we&#39;re both doing the comprehensive study, but providing some high level options to the council addresses both the need to ultimately get the study done, but also a need for quicker action and recommendations. Sorry, it took me a while to get there.</td>

So we really want to see that through. And I know that the other project is in that place of gathering community conversation, is going through community conversation. So I just needed to ask the question because it was important for me to understand kind of where we are. I don&#39;t want to see that we&#39;re doing this and that&#39;s being stalled unless we can kind of speed this up in a certain way. But, you know, maybe the fall is worthy.

Just wanted to be on the record that I&#39;m not committed to voting for final changes. I think it depends what the changes are and looking forward to seeing those. I think there&#39;s a way to do this that increases the amount of affordable housing being built. There&#39;s also a way that leads to a decrease in the amount of affordable housing built, but it really depends what the details are, and so looking forward to seeing this studied and seeing what the recommendations are and seeing what ends up getting proposed. I&#39;ll also just say that I hope this includes a study of doing step function for inclusionary zoning, where it could be 1% for smaller projects, another percent for larger projects. I think we could even do more than 20% for large projects. We could do 22%. We could do 25% for large projects, because you get that economy of scale. So this includes that. I also hope it includes the thing we talked about in the multifamily zoning conversation, which is using funding from the Affordable Housing Trust to fund inclusionary units, especially in smaller projects that aren&#39;t currently covered by the inclusionary zoning ordinance. We have all these developments that end up being less than 10 units that don&#39;t have any inclusionary housing in them right now. If we are using funding from the Affordable Housing Trust and we find that&#39;s a good use of funds, we could get affordable units in those buildings. So I hope this includes that in this study as well. With that, I yield.</td>

                <td>We move now to Charter Right Number 2, Policy Order 2025, Number 69. I think I got that right. City managers requested to include in the fiscal 26 operating budget a continued commitment to emergency housing vouchers for permanent supportive housing and mixed status families and the transition wellness center as well as allocate the necessary resources to establish a municipal successor to Rise Up Cambridge that builds on its mission of direct dignified economic support to families. The amendment that I made by substitution was voted and passed. Council Wilson exercised her charter right prior to the vote on the policy order as amended being voted. So we are now at the motion to either adopt or to amend, to vote as amended. Am I correct in that? That&#39;s I&#39;m reading your directions.</td>

We&#39;re in some serious times right now. I don&#39;t really know what to call it other than this is really unprecedented times, and we know that we have members of our community that are... really struggling in a lot of areas. We have tried through committee meetings to have deeper conversations, whether on the Transition Wellness Center, on a Rise Up Successor program. We recognize that these programs were both supported by opera dollars and that those dollars have now run out. We recognize that these dollars also created a tremendous amount of just hope and and quality of life for members of our community which is really priceless when we&#39;re really thinking about the dollars that was invested so here we have this policy order while we just voted the mayor&#39;s substitution that supported the vouchers THIS HERE IS TO SUPPORT THE ADDITIONAL VOUCHERS FOR THOSE REMAINING INDIVIDUALS IN THE TRANSITIONAL WELLNESS CENTER AS WELL AS A RISE-UP SUCCESSOR PROGRAM. AND SO I&#39;M HOPEFUL AND I KNOW THE CITY MANAGER HAS SOME AGREEMENT HE COULD SPEAK TO HIS FEELINGS AND THOUGHTS ABOUT KIND OF WHERE WE ARE NOW. why this was brought forward but we believe that this is important for us to continue to you know protect and support our neighbors and provide opportunities for them to have a really robust quality of life as we move forward especially through these uncertain days so I Madam Mayor, I&#39;ll yield for now and allow maybe some of my co-sponsors to speak before maybe turning it over to the city manager.

I especially want to thank the residents of the Wellness Center who came forward to share their stories. That&#39;s not an easy thing, I think, to do to a bunch of strangers and on camera. I think it demonstrates their dedication and how important this issue is to them, so I appreciate them. We have had a lot of conversations about this. There&#39;s been a lot of conversation over the last week since after the substitute was passed and the charter right. As much, and I told the manager this, as much as I would prefer that the Transition Wellness Center remain open, That&#39;s not in the cards. And the manager and I and my colleagues talked a lot this week about what else could we do or what is possible if keeping the Wellness Center open was not. And that&#39;s where we landed on this additional million dollars to support. It&#39;s hard to say how many vouchers exactly because the different prices, different costs on different vouchers and whatnot, but roughly 25 or so vouchers that will go specifically to the unhoused community. So Mr. Manager, I appreciate your flexibility in finding that money to do that. But we&#39;re still talking about 58 fewer shelter beds than we&#39;ve had for the past few years. But I do appreciate we&#39;re getting something. We heard calls in public comment about prioritizing the folks who are at the Wellness Center now. I&#39;ve had a few preliminary conversations with the city about this. It&#39;s unclear if that&#39;s even possible to do. There are some other issues around. There&#39;s a whole process in determining who gets vouchers. You have folks in other shelters that have been unhoused for, might be in greater need, and do you shift the list to benefit some people and not others? Those are all sort of conversations that have to be had. What is clear is that, at the very least, the folks who are in the Wellness Center now would be eligible to apply for these vouchers, at the very least. So that&#39;s a good thing. But I think there&#39;s some discussion about we should get some clarification as to the prioritization. In terms of... And I do want to make it clear, and I don&#39;t know if Ms. Seminoff wants to come up here just to make sure that I&#39;m right. Are you asking her to come up?</td>

So while it absolutely is a wet shelter, there are spaces there for people who are in recovery. Unlike some of the other shelters which we all understand closed in the middle of April where people did not necessarily have a place to go, anyone from the Wellness Center who, right now the staff are working with them to try to find the best solution for each of them If they don&#39;t find a different solution that they want or can access, there will be beds for them at 240 Albany Street.</td>

I&#39;ve heard there were going to be beds, and I heard maybe there wasn&#39;t. So I just want to make sure that we were clear on that. So anyway, I hope we pass this. Again, my preference would be that the Wellness Center remained open. I think you all know that by now. But this is better than what the alternative was a week ago, which was nothing. And I certainly hope that we will continue to work with the folks that are there. I think when we do the evaluations and the assessments and determine the list and where folks fit on the list, I do think it&#39;s important to take into account the place where they&#39;re staying now is closing. And like the warming center did, like Harvard did, making them maybe in a more vulnerable situation than folks who are in places that aren&#39;t facing closing. So I hope all of that gets taken into account. I want to have a continued conversation just to clarify what we can and cannot do for them. But I&#39;m glad that an additional million dollars is not insignificant. And then, you know, obviously for RISE, I appreciate that we&#39;re going to continue to look at a successor program. I do think it makes a significant difference for people. And I hope that the order says fund as soon as possible, and I hope it&#39;s sooner rather than later. So I&#39;ll yield for now, Madam Mayor.

The city manager did indicate as these folks here have worked really hard to say, is there any way we can find some kind of voucher money? And I really appreciate that moving forward that we can&#39;t do everything and we&#39;re doing so much already, but this will be doing more. And similar to Rise Up, I really look forward to understanding what a successor program would be. I did send a possible amendment just to clarify that with the Rise Up that we would get an update which would include scope and cost, because I&#39;m not sure what the scope would be. So we&#39;ve talked about this huge range of possibilities, and I&#39;d love to just make sure that when it comes back that that&#39;s included in the report as well.

And those have generally been the main priorities of the Affordable Housing Trust as we think about which projects we are seeking to fund. I would imagine that there would be projects that hit on each of those as we move forward.</td>

                <td>My concern is, again, I feel as though the residents at the Transition Wellness Center have been very lucky. It sounds like a wonderful, wonderful place. In committing the vouchers, we&#39;re not just committing $1 million this year, we&#39;re committing $1 million that could be forever after. That&#39;s $40,000 per person to provide them with these municipal vouchers. It&#39;s a big commitment. I feel like it does seem as though the people are getting weller at the Transition Wellness Center, so it would be sad to put them out on the street. But I do feel as though, ultimately, we have had, I think, 500 homeless for, what, 30, 40 years, no matter what we do, no matter how many SROs we create. I think now we&#39;re up to 700 unhoused individuals. But there is a limitless supply of people that will be coming to Cambridge for our services because we are so generous and kind. So I&#39;m just aware, I think we all have to be aware that we already were committing $16 million to unhoused services, and then we learned that CARE is mostly providing services for the unhoused, so that&#39;s another $3 million. And then this is another million, so we&#39;re up to 20 million for the unhoused, which again is a group that will continue to grow as long as we support it. So again, I do feel like these are difficult times and I want everybody to have a bed to sleep on. But I&#39;m a little concerned about whether this is the right use of resources. And even though it still seems like we have a lot of money, if you&#39;re trying to provide I just feel like I wish we could be, and I&#39;d love to be part of the conversations about Bay Cove at 240 Albany Street. It just seems like we should really be investing there and figuring out how to make that a better place rather than committing to vouchers forever. And maybe we&#39;re not committing to vouchers forever. Maybe we&#39;re just committing to these 25 vouchers for one year. But I think we really need to come up with a long-term solution for how we&#39;re going to provide for our unhoused community. So that&#39;s one response to this policy order. The other part is, again, I feel like Rise Up Cambridge is a wonderful program, but And I realize that those recipients of that extra cash have benefited from it and that times will be worse and it&#39;ll be nice to have that cash. But I just feel like we&#39;re going to have so much less cash. And the people in Rise Up Cambridge have housing vouchers. They have housing. They have services. They have so much already. This is like one more add-on. So I don&#39;t feel as, though I think it&#39;s a wonderful program in flush times, I don&#39;t feel as compelled to continue this conversation. We&#39;ve had this conversation five times about Rise Up Cambridge. I do think we have to evaluate programs going forward, and I hope we&#39;ll be doing more of that. And if we can find more cash, I think we&#39;ve got to really look very critically and constructively at the array of programs that we offer, but if we can eliminate some other spending, and if we feel like Rise Up Cambridge goes to the top, then I think that&#39;s a good decision, but I can&#39;t imagine that we&#39;ll be there in August of 2025. Again, things are just about to get worse, so why are we having this conversation yet one more time? For those reasons, I have some, though again, I commend, I love the big hearts of my colleagues. I question whether this is thinking with our heads as well as our hearts, and whether These are really amendments that in the long run will improve the life overall of our citizens. That&#39;s my concern. Thank you. I yield.</td>

                <td> THROUGH MAYOR SIMMONS, I THINK THIS CAME OUT OF A DESIRE ULTIMATELY TO BE RESPONSIVE TO THE CONCERN FROM THE COUNCIL THAT WE NEED TO MAKE GREATER INVESTMENT IN HOMELESS SERVICES. I THINK THIS CAME AS A DESIRE TO BE MORE RESPONSIVE TO THE CONCERN FROM THE COUNCIL THAT WITHIN THE BUDGET AND AS WE&#39;RE THINKING ABOUT FUNDING NEW PROGRAMS THAT DESPITE ALL THAT WE ACTUALLY HAVE PUT IN, INCLUDING THE CONTINUATION OF A NUMBER OF ARPA PROGRAMS FOR HOMELESS SERVICES, THAT THERE IS A DESIRE TO SEE MORE SUPPORT FOR THOSE WHO ARE HOMELESS. AND SO THIS WOULD PROVIDE a path to permanent housing and transition out of homelessness for a number of people. I think we did feel very strongly that there should be criteria and that there should be a fair process for determining who would be eligible and who would receive these vouchers, recognizing that certainly those who are at the Transition Wellness Center You know are in a spot where they&#39;re going to have to make a decision transition to a different shelter but actually we have a whole community of people who are unhoused within the city and that Our staff have actually developed a very fair and comprehensive process for allocating those resources I think in terms of the conversations we&#39;ve been having about Federal vouchers that may be disappearing. I think this ends up also being a bit of a precursor to say that there are federal emergency housing vouchers that have already provided many people with a path out of homelessness. The city has funded supportive services that the federal government doesn&#39;t provide dollars for to ensure that people who want to receive those services stay housed and that there&#39;s just support for them and their needs. Those are supportive services that I think we would also desire to be providing as part of this program. And ultimately within the existing city budget, we felt like we could make a little bit more space for this. I would note, this has been a conversation with the council where I have said, we spend all year in discussions. We try to work in the different priorities that the council has into the budget. um to the extent that we are finding more funding for uh homelessness that does represent if the council desires it some level of prioritization and it would make it harder you know there are a lot of things that we want to fund and so i just want to recognize that it is still one budget that we are ultimately funding everything out of So I hope that&#39;s helpful as kind of context, and I think this would be proposed to fit into the existing FY26 operating budget outside of the $5 million that we&#39;ve been discussing as a federal stabilization fund.</td>

My second question is on the second order, and I appreciate Council Siddiqui&#39;s strong advocacy and her support for this program. I&#39;m just a little concerned about the way it&#39;s worded, and I just wanted to get a sense of what your understanding of the wording is, because it says, is requested to allocate funding for a successor program and originally i don&#39;t remember the exact verbiage of the policy order that we unanimously passed a while ago was for you to come back with a proposal for a future for the rise up program and what funding would look like and where it would come from and at least and maybe council sadiki wants to speak to what what is meant by the the phraseology here but the way it&#39;s written now it sounds like you&#39;re just going to allocate money to it without any of that background information, but I just wanted some clarification on that before we vote.</td>

And there were probably a dozen, I think, different scenarios. And each one would have a different cost to it. And so I think my co-sponsors, correct me if I&#39;m wrong, I think in this, what we&#39;re asking for between now and August that those meetings take place to decide which one of those options makes the most sense to proceed. And then it goes from there as to what the cost of that would be. Is that a cost that can be done this year? Is it a cost that has to wait until 2027? That&#39;s why we say as soon as possible. We&#39;re not saying to do it. you know, in September, but, you know, sooner rather than later, I think we would want. But I think we&#39;re definitely ready between now and August, given that all that groundwork has already been done, to meet and discuss about which one of those options would make the most sense. Am I missing anything?</td>

                <td> Yeah, Madam Mayor. Thank you. Through you to my colleague, I would like to just add, Vice Mayor said quite a bit to it. With those options that were shared with us, they also presented in terms of what would be like a benefit cliff. So what might trigger, say, MassHealth to go forward? where members of the public would then, members of this community would then lose their benefits to some degree. So how might we want to adjust that so that they don&#39;t? So maybe it&#39;s people, individuals who are at 100 AMI up to maybe like 125 or 150, although the 150 may actually trigger MassHealth benefits. So I think there&#39;s going to be a little bit of a some some massaging that we have to do in terms of identifying who exactly qualifies based on the dollar and that will kind of determine what the dollar amount will be recognizing that it takes time to implement this whole um this whole successor program especially if it&#39;s going under through the city that that&#39;s going to take months to then implement. So ideally having the city manager come back to us by August allows for the movement to go into play. So hopefully everything could be up and running by January 1. That&#39;s in my perfect world vision. That&#39;s my perfect world. Doesn&#39;t mean that&#39;s the way things may go. But then if that is the case, then it will be January through June in terms of that fiscal year, fiscal year 26. It will be a half a year, and then it will be the full year for the following FY27. So I don&#39;t know. Councilor Siddiqui, do you have anything to add before we go to the city manager?</td>

I think there certainly was a desire to. And I think there are members of the public who wanted that. And I think going back to prioritization, it doesn&#39;t seem like we were able to find the funds to do that in this year&#39;s budget. And I think there was also feeling that this was meant for two years from now which you know I think when I think about cash assistance and doing this type of work you know to someone&#39;s point earlier saying that people have too much you know I don&#39;t agree with that I think it&#39;s about housing other needs plus cash and So, you know, I just wanted to share my point of view on that piece of it. But I do think if there&#39;s... I think I don&#39;t want... I want the message to the community to be, if there is majority support to this, to say we aren&#39;t going to forget about it and we can continue to work on it and figuring out the who and how much. And... making that clear because I do think there was a lot of good work including from the city manager&#39;s office and the strategy team helping around thinking through some of this and I think we&#39;ve been able to get closer on the scoping issue and different scenarios that have been you know, discussed. And so there are more decisions to be made. And so I think that&#39;s kind of the spirit of, I&#39;d say this ordered.</td>

                <td> Through you, Mayor Simmons. I think that&#39;s right. I would say that certainly in the April 17th Human Services Committee, we felt like there was a path. I think ultimately there&#39;s still scoping work to be done. There&#39;s options to be discussed. The scale of the program could be smaller or larger depending on where we set eligibility. There&#39;s work to do just in terms of and figuring out benefit cliffs and how we want to manage that. I think those are all, and I said this during the committee meeting, those are all things that we can, none of those are deal breakers. Those are all things that we can solve. The challenge really is resourcing in terms of finding the budget for a program of that scale, recognizing that scale is also a decision that needs to be made. I think ultimately we had the prior day on April the 16th, the finance committee meeting where we discussed both the longer term projections for the city&#39;s operating budget and the capital budget and proposed that we would have collectively with the city council a prioritization conversation where we could look at what are the major projects that we want to allocate resourcing to. And so I think I think we&#39;re still committed to doing that I would say that it is challenging where when we approach individual ideas or projects there&#39;s always going to be a strong level of support for those projects and one of the One of the areas that I think we can strengthen our decision-making is to be discussing major projects in the context of our long-term projections and to understand that we are making choices. And so if collectively what we are saying is the next sort of major program we want to fund is Rise Up, and that&#39;s what we want to free up budget for and that&#39;s what we want to plan for then let&#39;s have that conversation we can scope out the work and the city can get to work figuring out how this fits into future budgets but that does mean that other things will have to take a back seat as we figure out those budgeting priorities And it does take some runway for us to incorporate, depending on the size, those programs. So I think it really is, and this was the original policy order, thinking about the feasibility of Rise Up in the context of the next budget cycle, so FY27, which would start in July of 2026, so next July. And I think having that prioritization conversation with the council, figuring out the scoping, and then knowing this is the target that we&#39;re working for, and these are the things that we&#39;re not going to be able to do is really important for us to work through as a process. And I think the challenge will just be what the economic environment looks like. I think we&#39;ll know more by the end of this year in terms of the local impact and in terms of how much uncertainty we&#39;re facing from the federal government. I do have really significant concerns with whether there&#39;s a worst case scenario where we would really be stretched as we&#39;re trying to consider which major program cuts we&#39;re trying to rescue and fund. But there&#39;s certainly also a better case scenario where the courts have blocked many of the actions that are being taken and where we have more flexibility. And so I do think having this conversation as we move forward, being able to discuss it as we get into the fall and plan for that next budget process feels to me like the right next step.</td>

                <td>Thanks, Madam Mayor. There were just a couple points I wanted to raise. Similar to the Vice Mayor, I&#39;m saddened the Transitional Wellness Center will be closing. That was the intent of the original policy order. Looking forward to continuing to improve our process of communication around priorities. I think the one point I wanted to make was there was outreach around this being funded with ARPA funding running out. Would you say if you compare the outreach around this versus around when a shelter opens from the state opens a shelter? I think there&#39;s more communication around that. You know, when the state opened the court, the Middlesex Court shelter, we did a big zoom around it. I live around the corner from the current state shelter in There were flyers on every door there. I don&#39;t think anyone would argue we didn&#39;t do quite that level of communication around closing this shelter. And I would just say, Cambridge is the kind of community where we&#39;ve seen closing a shelter is actually more controversial than opening a shelter. And I think that&#39;s something to celebrate. And in a lot of places, even in Massachusetts, you open a shelter and there&#39;s a lot of pushback. We don&#39;t see that level of pushback in Cambridge when you open a shelter. I&#39;m proud of that. We do see pushback when we close a shelter, and so we should think about how do we do the level of outreach around something like that in the future, because that&#39;s the kind of citizens and residents we have, and that&#39;s a good thing, in my opinion. But then just to the other point that the Vice Mayor raised, I think, around prioritization around this, any conversation around prioritization is also implicitly a conversation about who you&#39;re not prioritizing. I would be uncomfortable not prioritizing residents of other shelters with this. I think there are residents in other shelters in Cambridge who are in really tough situations, folks with domestic violence, folks who have been unhoused for a long time and that they should be considered in this for a while. I think in a perfect world with unlimited funding, we&#39;d be providing vouchers for all residents in shelters, but we&#39;re not in that perfect world. And I think that, you know, gets to the other work we&#39;re doing around housing and how we, you know, places that have more affordable housing have less homelessness. And we have to keep that in mind because, you know, homelessness is a housing problem ultimately. And then just lastly, I would say, you know, rise is critical. It&#39;s, you know, for me, it&#39;s a high priority. I think to the point about increasing the budget, Funding rise doesn&#39;t mean we&#39;re necessarily increasing the budget. There are plenty of things in the budget we can be reallocating to, and that ultimately it&#39;s not us as a city council who decides that. It&#39;s the city manager. Our job as a council is to say what we prioritize. I&#39;m comfortable moving forward with this language tonight, but we also have this prioritization meeting coming up, and we can have in those conversations where rise stands in relation to other priorities. So with that, I yield back.</td>

I just wanted to make people aware that we&#39;re not trying to rush something through and that the intent of the original sponsors of this policy order was where there is retail already in place, but because of current zoning, if properties ever get redeveloped, those places would not be allowed to exist. So all we&#39;re asking is for CDD to draft some language that would allow them to reopen and that&#39;s only obviously if the future property owner and developer wants retail in their space but also there may be other places in the city where retail would be welcome and beneficial to the neighborhood but we need cdd&#39;s help in understanding what we can and can&#39;t do in terms of how we write that language so That&#39;s what we&#39;ve asked them to do. The new order is to have the language go to the Economic Development and University Relations Committee and the Neighborhood and Long Term Planning Committee before it even goes to the Ordinance Committee to give people some assurance that there&#39;ll be full and robust conversation about whatever that draft language is before it gets into the ordinance pipeline. And that&#39;s the intent. Thank you, Madam Mayor.</td>

I was talking to a friend today who was saying that in Paris, they actually require neighborhood retail. They require a pharmacy and a bakery and a food store to be within walking distance. So I do think neighborhood retail does make communities vital. There was also an article in the Globe just a couple days ago which talked about how neighborhood retail can also discourage gun violence because neighbors are watching neighbors. They&#39;re connecting with neighbors, which deescalates tensions. So I&#39;m all for neighborhood retail. I just want to make sure that we proceed with this conversation in a thoughtful way.

                <td>Yes, I did. Thank you, Madam Mayor. I wanted to say, I think that this is something that feels, I&#39;m glad that we&#39;re having this discussion. It will feel more urgent when a development actually happens, like Pearl Street Market did, where the development is happening. People might want to preserve that retail location. But zoning doesn&#39;t move at the space of development. And at that moment, we will not be able to save that location, right? So that&#39;s why we have these conversations proactively. And we have three options, right? We can leave the zoning as is, in which case that retail will be lost. we can change the zoning to just allow those uses, which is really easy because we have one residential district. And so it&#39;s literally just changing two nos to a yes in our table of uses for like neighborhood grocery and maybe restaurant use or coffee shop. And then there&#39;s a third option, which is we could do something much more detailed and try to map out exactly where we want spaces. But I will also say that, you know, I think that&#39;s fine if that&#39;s what the will of the council is. But right now, the only places that are legalized for, you know, all these retail uses are, you know, outside of more industrial areas as like the... squares and Mass Ave and a little bit of and maybe half of Cambridge Street and just one or two other stops. And so we don&#39;t have a definition of like corridors and quarters in our neighborhood. And so to add that would be a lengthy process. And I think that&#39;s fine if that&#39;s where the council wants to go. But just did want to say that that that is a more complicated answer than just changing the table of uses. And I&#39;m open to all the different options out there. So with that, I would support the amendments and I&#39;m excited for the conversation to continue.</td>

                <td>Thank you, Mayor Simmons. Yes, I moved my charter right since we&#39;re all looking forward, I&#39;m sure, to that meeting. I believe it&#39;s next week when we&#39;ll be discussing in committee how to ensure that we develop protocols or practices or policies for curb cuts to be yeah basically define it but we don&#39;t have that yet so these are before us and a prior curb cut that we approved a few weeks ago it turns out that there were about six neighbors who actually had expressed disapproval and we never got notice of that and they were overwhelming more in disapproval than in approval so i&#39;m just very concerned that we&#39;re not getting the proper information i charter wrote it partly so that i could we could just give more time to the neighbors and let them know that we hadn&#39;t heard very many. So people know. I will be voting no on this because my policy would be that unless at least half of the direct neighbors within a block are in favor, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair for us to take public space, which is the Street in order to give it to an individual what we have got on the record is Of the people who live on that block and I believe there are a couple that the city just got the City Council just got forwarded today the neighborhood association is not in favor of Four residents of that block on Alpine Street have two of them were already included in the packet and Robart Liz Marin to were also subsequently joy hackling we met Simmers were all disapproving and I think part of it is that this is a curb cut where the actual driver will be on the front yard not on the side of the house and I think there was some concern that many of the neighbors felt like that was not something they could support and And they had raised that issue even in the development and it was ignored by the, but we did get several in favor. We got two on the block in favor, two people live on the block in favor. And then the council got three others, but none of those people actually live on the block. One of them lives five blocks away, one of them lives three blocks away, and one of them lives one block away. Again, it&#39;s up to the council, but for me, I will discount people who don&#39;t live on that block since they are most directly affected. I think it&#39;s very important that since we do have this authority, and the reason we do is because no other approvals along the way take into account what the neighbors feel or what the street is like. It is 100% just as it meet our requirements. guidelines? Does it have the right dimensions? Is it historical? So there&#39;s the only step in the process right now that takes into account the community is us. So I just wanted to make sure that my colleagues understood that and knew what we have. Now this isn&#39;t everyone on the street, but there was also a reference in the packet of a I think from the developer saying they had reached out to some abutters and they chose not to send anything, but they were not going to sign the approval. So that says to me there&#39;s probably a couple of others who actually are also opposed. So I wanted to make sure that the full council knew that, and I will certainly be voting no. I hope the rest of my colleagues do too, because otherwise we&#39;re not really honoring the people who live on that street and will be most directly impacted. Oh, and one other thing that was raised was a concern about children playing on the street and creating another driveway access for a couple cars to go across the sidewalk. Thank you, Mayor Simmons.</td>

I really think and I hope whatever future policy comes out of ordinance doesn&#39;t make it a popularity contest. We should have objective criteria. In this case, the Historic Commission, ISD, DPW all signed off on it. We do have some of the neighbors saying they&#39;re in support of it and some who aren&#39;t. I&#39;m very concerned that if we make curb cuts, something where it&#39;s just like who can get the most neighbors to write into us, it won&#39;t actually be about what&#39;s the best use of the property. We keep talking about concerns about parking. This will take someone off the street and have them in their driveway. There was also testimony about some ADA related issues. but I truly hope that whatever comes back to us in ordinance is a fair, clear, objective criteria for whether it should have a curb cut or not. There could be some factor in there about, you know, that the staff looks into how will this impact the neighbors, I hope, but I really hope it doesn&#39;t become, you know, who can get the most emails for or against the curb cut. So I will be supporting it, thank you.</td>

                <td>Thank you, Madam Mayor, through you. We definitely did get a number of folks on the street who have concerns, and I think part of it is, as Councilor Nolan pointed out, is that Unlike a typical curb cut where you put a driveway and a car is at the side of the house, these will be in the front. I think where I&#39;m struggling, and maybe Councilor Nolan can, because she&#39;s looked into this a little bit more, maybe there&#39;s an opportunity to place it on the table and do more work. I am concerned about when I heard the applicants that they&#39;re asking for this curb cut, not necessarily because they don&#39;t want to walk from the from the street to their house, but there&#39;s a medical condition. And we&#39;re hearing so much about the loss of parking, and how can you take parking away if someone is disabled? I mean, this is someone who doesn&#39;t seem like they&#39;re asking for it to make it easier to carry in their groceries. The person has a degenerative arthritis condition that&#39;s going to make it very difficult for that person to walk. you know, you&#39;re weighing the aesthetics of having cars parked in front of a house as opposed to the side of the house versus someone who may not be able to walk to their car. So I guess I&#39;m a little, I mean, it&#39;s, you know, I&#39;m a little torn on it. I want to be respectful of the folks on the street who have concerns, but I also want to be understanding and compassionate to you know, the person who has a medical condition. So I don&#39;t know, I mean, I guess, Councilor Nolan, do you and you&#39;re talking to people, is there an opportunity to maybe try and resolve this in another way or is this, you know, up or down and that&#39;s it?</td>

And one of them did mention, if it is a medical condition, we have an established procedure to having a handicapped spot in front of your house. That is something open to anybody in the city there, if you have a documented condition. And that was one of the responses to someone saying, if that is what they need, then they should certainly apply for that. But if we wanna see if there&#39;s another way to resolve it, Maybe the neighborhood would be open to that. We could lay it on the table to discuss it yet again. To your point that the question is how do we, it should be set rules and for me it would be if more than half or half the people on the street don&#39;t want it, it seems to me, then I wouldn&#39;t support it because who am I to say that that shouldn&#39;t happen. But that&#39;s through you. I hope that is responsive to Vice Mayor McGovern&#39;s question.</td>

So I was, I thought that maybe they could have a one-car driveway to the side because, so there, I don&#39;t know if everyone saw it, but there was a letter from Doug Brown, who&#39;s an officer of the Fresh Pond Residence, And what he said is, I must confess that I find it difficult to support this application given the neighborhood&#39;s continuing opposition to this curb cut. I cannot support the proposal as is, partly because very few other homes have dedicated curb cuts. on Alpine Street, approximately three out of 20 homes. But more significantly, because the relief sought, front yard parking is generally not allowed under current zoning and would set an undesirable precedent for the neighborhood. To me, that&#39;s where I get stuck. I do think that once we allow one neighbor to park their cars on their front lawn, and now with the multifamily housing proposal, we&#39;ll have 10-foot front lawns for trees. Once we allow them to be able to park on their frontage, then anybody can do it. I would be open to, they&#39;re having a one-car driveway. um and most of their front yard would be yard that would be following zone our zoning rules and that would allow their handicapped driver to have a place to park so i don&#39;t know if we can specify that we would support a one car driveway to the side of the house but not they&#39;re driving they&#39;re parking all over the front lawn can we and council i can&#39;t help you i don&#39;t know and i have no one from the staff</td>

So if I may, I&#39;d like to take a moment to speak to this resolution as we enter our final weeks with our city clerk. Do you mind if I call you by your first name? Diane, as we know, you&#39;ve brought a steady hand, although we had a couple of rows up here, but that aside, and a principled approach to this work, serving not only as a guardian of our records and the keeper of our legislative process, but as a trusted and respected colleague. In a role that demands precision, discretion, and deep understanding of municipal law, which I think you have a hold on very good, Diane has consistently demonstrated professionalism and grace. She has modernized and strengthened the clerk&#39;s office, made it more transparent and accessible to the public, and helped ensure that the council work has been conducted with integrity and care, and that is no small feat. As Diane concludes her service at the end of the month, I hope she will leave knowing how much she has meant to this body, to this building, and to this city. I personally, and I think I can speak on behalf of the council, we thank you. We honor you, and we wish you nothing but the best in your next chapter. Discussion. Vice Mayor?

And I know it was not... you know, not an easy role to fill and you made a lot of changes that, you know, sometimes it&#39;s hard to do that, you know, but I think there were necessary changes to kind of bring us into compliance with some things and, you know, so I really do appreciate that. You know, you brought a, you bring a unique perspective to the role as being a former counselor which I think in Waltham, which I think helped you to see both sides of the coin sometimes when things that we were trying to do that you could help us navigate through. So I always appreciate that. You always took my calls even when I drove you crazy today. Maybe that was my present to you on your way out. But I do thank you and I do wish you the best.</td>

But, you know, when I was first elected, you know, committee reports, like after a committee hearing, if there was a vote, it would take months to get out. There were some that had a backlog of years. It was such an incredibly difficult place. And you came into the office, and you not only cleaned it up and went through such an entire backlog, But to the point where there was times in the multifamily housing conversation with you, we had days to turn something around because the vote was that close and you excelled. You took us from, you know, months of backlogs to days turnaround. It was an incredible, incredible performance. And like personally, you know, it was really meaningful to me as well. Like your hiring process was the first one I took a part of as a city councilor. And I couldn&#39;t be more happier to also the more personal facts of of, you know, you officiated the wedding for my legislative aide, Lynn, and that was a deeply personal moment as well. So just thank you for all of these things and more, and only wishing you the best of luck.</td>

So as much as I was probably a little cranky sometimes when you were responding with that specific detail, I really also fundamentally appreciate it because you kept us on track and me on track in making sure that things were done in a way that... were appropriate and were in line with the duties of both the council as well as your job. And I really appreciate showing the way for other departments in the city to modernize, to bring us up to speed, to bring forth in a timely manner the basic responsibilities of the office and get them done.

You went ahead and hired an archivist. The archivist had brought on five young students to help get all this wonderful history that we have in this building and make it in a way that someone might be able to find something. So I certainly wanted just to add that to my testimony and I would ask my colleagues, will you please join me in a standing ovation for our colleague? Congratulations.

Getting to know all of you has been a blessing. I&#39;ve learned so much with regard to your suggestions that I should go lay on a beach and vacation. I&#39;m not sure how that&#39;s going to go. I&#39;ve never done that. I&#39;ll give it some thought. Yeah, I can&#39;t say that I won&#39;t be taking on some additional duties, but I will take a few months off. Yeah, I&#39;m kind of speechless at the moment, but I will miss all of you. I wish all of you well. I have such admiration for what each and every one of you has done and the work that you do. It&#39;s a very, very hard job. It&#39;s always been a hard job. And I don&#39;t know that everybody really appreciates all of the work that you put in, and especially in the environment that you&#39;re working in. in this political environment. It&#39;s only continuing to get harder each and every day, and you just come here with such passion and commitment, and you all do your best for the people of Cambridge, and again, that&#39;s truly admirable, and it&#39;s been a privilege to work with each of you. Again, I will miss you, and mostly I will miss the staff in the city clerk&#39;s office. Nicole, Paula, who&#39;s not here, but the entire staff who really have lifted me up over the last three years and have allowed me to do my job. So I thank you and I wish you all the best.</td>

And so I thought it&#39;d be fitting to mark her life, not her passing, but her life. And so I offer this resolution in the hope that it will be adopted unanimously. Discussion?</td>

And if we will either go all day on Thursday or if we finish in time, we expect it&#39;ll probably, hopefully it&#39;ll just be half a day. But thanks. That&#39;s it for the Finance Committee.
