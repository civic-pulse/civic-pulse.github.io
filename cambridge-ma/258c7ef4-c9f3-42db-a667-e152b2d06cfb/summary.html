<p><strong>City Manager's Agenda Item #1: Federal Update on Relevant Court Cases</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong> City Manager Huang, City Solicitor Bayer, and Assistant City Solicitor LaPianca provided an update on federal court cases impacting municipalities.<ul>
<li><strong>King County vs. Turner:</strong> Preliminary injunction prevents HUD from enforcing grant conditions for Continuum of Care Grants. HUD accepted an edited grant agreement, making funds available.</li>
<li><strong>California vs. Department of Transportation:</strong> Preliminary injunction applies to cities and towns, preventing enforcement of federal immigration cooperation conditions for DOT grants.</li>
<li><strong>Trump vs. Casa Inc.:</strong> Supreme Court ruled against "universal injunctions," meaning injunctions only apply to parties in the case, not all similarly situated parties. This makes challenging executive orders more difficult.</li>
<li><strong>United States vs. Los Angeles:</strong> DOJ filed a new case challenging sanctuary policies, similar to cases in Rochester, Illinois, Colorado, and Newark.</li>
<li><strong>AAU vs. Department of Defense:</strong> Temporary restraining order issued against DoD funding cuts related to indirect costs for military-based research.</li>
<li><strong>Harvard vs. DHS:</strong> Judge enjoined federal government from revoking Harvard's ability to enroll foreign students. A presidential proclamation to bar foreign students was stayed.</li>
</ul>

<li><strong>Councilor Nolan:</strong> Confirmed discussion was only on legal cases.</li>

<p><strong>City Manager's Agenda Item #3: 2024 Transportation Demand Management Program Report</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong> City Manager Huang and PTDM Planner Ryan McKinnon presented the report.<ul>
<li><strong>Councilor Nolan:</strong> Asked about follow-up for projects not meeting single-occupancy vehicle (SOV) commitments. Noted wide range of "failure" (6% to 60%). Highlighted that most SOV reduction is due to remote work, and transit use has plummeted. Emphasized public transit improvements as the top strategy for reducing car trips.</li>
<li><strong>Mr. McKinnon:</strong> Explained working with projects to develop additional TDM measures. Acknowledged transit as the most important factor for people.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Zusy:</strong> Praised the report. Asked about city employee commute data and Cambridge resident workforce data. Inquired about shuttle usage.</li>
<li><strong>Mr. McKinnon:</strong> Stated resident workforce data is not generally tracked. City employee data is pending. Explained that shuttle usage is part of public transit sub-modes.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Zusy:</strong> Emphasized the need for city worker data and ensuring shuttles are utilized. Noted 17% of businesses not meeting commitments due to not implementing all measures or significant transit mode share reduction.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Azeem:</strong> Asked about the status of the Better Bus Network redesign.</li>
<li><strong>Commissioner McKenna:</strong> Stated a slow rollout over five years, with frequency improvements for the #1 bus coming in the fall.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Azeem:</strong> Hoped for further discussion on bus service improvements.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Motion:</strong> Councilor Nolan moved to accept the report and place on file.<ul>

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>City Manager's Agenda Item #4: Review of Barriers to Housing Production, Inclusionary Housing Study, and Development Incentives</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong> City Manager Huang, Assistant City Manager Peters, and Director Cotter presented the memo.<ul>
<li><strong>Councilor Azeem:</strong> Acknowledged the difficult conversation. Suggested exploring multiple options beyond just lowering the inclusionary rate (e.g., funding mechanisms, tax abatements, using trust funds). Requested more research on these options for a September/October update.</li>
<li><strong>Mr. Cotter:</strong> Agreed that a Nexus study done earlier would have shown similar market challenges. Stated the next study will begin in early FY26.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Toner:</strong> Expressed frustration that the study was due two years ago. Advocated for a temporary reduction of inclusionary zoning to 10% for two years to help stalled projects. Noted that the city can directly control this, unlike state-level changes.</li>
<li><strong>Ms. Peters:</strong> Clarified that different projects would pencil out at various inclusionary rates (8-13%).</li>
<li><strong>Vice Mayor McGovern:</strong> Acknowledged the current market conditions are not "perfect." Preferred exploring other options before cutting inclusionary zoning. Suggested exemptions for projects with special permits prior to the report. Emphasized the need for public education if inclusionary rates are cut.</li>
<li><strong>City Manager Huang:</strong> Clarified that temporary reduction is quickest, tax incentives are more complex (may need home rule petition), and funding inclusionary housing through the Affordable Housing Trust is more actionable. Capital funding is a medium-term action. Exempting building permit fees is actionable.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Zusy:</strong> Supported the timing of the next study. Felt more sympathetic to lowering inclusionary for large projects on corridors, not smaller neighborhood projects. Asked for clarification on "setting affordable rents based on affordability targets" and "variable set aside requirement."</li>
<li><strong>Mr. Cotter:</strong> Explained that Cambridge's inclusionary rents are based on actual household income (30%), unlike flat rents in most programs. Explained variable requirements as a framework to adapt to market conditions.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Zusy:</strong> Noted increased inquiries about demolition. Expressed concern that discussion might delay construction. Supported a revolving loan fund.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Siddiqui:</strong> Noted the report's mixed evidence on whether reducing inclusionary rates significantly increases housing starts. Expressed pause about the effectiveness of a reduction given other variables.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Sobrinho-Wheeler:</strong> Highlighted new projects on Ellery Street and Western Ave that believe they can make 20% inclusionary work, questioning the claims of other stalled projects.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Wilson:</strong> Appreciated the conversation but struggled with reducing inclusionary below 20%. Suggested using the Affordable Housing Trust to help projects pencil out. Questioned the hypothetical nature of the memo. Asked for concrete next steps from the City Manager.</li>
<li><strong>City Manager Huang:</strong> Stated the commitment is to explore options and provide actionable recommendations. Suggested a Housing Committee meeting over the summer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Motion:</strong> Councilor Azeem moved to place on file.<ul>
<li><strong>Vote:</strong> Motion passed by acclamation.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>City Manager's Agenda Item #5: Amendment to Welcoming Community Ordinance</strong></p>

<li><strong>Councilor Sobrinho-Wheeler:</strong> Thanked staff and moved to refer to the Ordinance Committee and pass to a second reading simultaneously. Noted ACLU agreement with changes.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Nolan:</strong> Supported passing to a second reading to allow for further changes and clear direction to police.</li>
<li><strong>City Solicitor Bayer:</strong> Confirmed productive conversation with ACLU, who supported the proposed changes.</li>
<li><strong>Mayor Simmons:</strong> Asked about the process for documenting ICE actions and badge numbers, noting the proposed amendments do not include this specific language.</li>
<li><strong>Superintendent Wells:</strong> Explained that officers are instructed to assess ICE interactions, report up the chain of command, and command staff ascertain facts and document.</li>
<li><strong>Mayor Simmons:</strong> Emphasized the need for consistent communication to the community about what to do during ICE actions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Motion:</strong> Councilor Sobrinho-Wheeler moved to refer to the Ordinance Committee and pass to a second reading.<ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong> City Manager Huang presented the draft goals.<ul>
<li><strong>Councilor Wilson:</strong> Asked about the City Manager's self-assessment and relationship with the Council. Inquired about steps for robust community engagement. Asked about hopes for the American Freedmen Commission.</li>
<li><strong>City Manager Huang:</strong> Stated the most important work is collective policy work. Highlighted strengthening consistency of engagement and piloting new methods. Expressed excitement for the American Freedmen Commission to begin meeting and fill the Executive Director position.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Siddiqui:</strong> Asked for clarification on updates since the May 1st discussion. Inquired about the scope of the "review boards and commissions" goal.</li>
<li><strong>City Manager Huang:</strong> Stated the main update was adding the goal around boards and commissions.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Nolan:</strong> Suggested more "SMART" goals (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound). Advocated for consolidating boards and commissions and improving city operations (e.g., moving away from paper-based systems).</li>
</ul>

<li><strong>Councilor Azeem:</strong> Thanked Owen and Charlie for their work, acknowledging the compromise. Stated new members bring value.</li>

<li><strong>Councilor Zusy:</strong> Asked if a special meeting could be held sooner to resolve the issue.</li>
<li><strong>Mayor Simmons:</strong> Stated a special meeting would not be held this week due to staff workload and the need for thoughtful consideration.</li>
