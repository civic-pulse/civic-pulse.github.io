<p><strong>Policy Order 1: That the city manager is requested to work with relevant city departments to determine whether the city council can revoke any already approved curb cap applications if said application was incomplete due to applicant failure.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pulled by:</strong> City Councilor Catherine Zusy</li>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong> City Councilor Zusy, co-sponsor with City Councilor Nolan, expressed concern about a developer withholding negative abutters' postcards. City Councilor Toner suggested addressing this within the ongoing ordinance committee discussion on curb cuts. Vice Mayor McGovern supported the order due to concerns about incomplete information. City Councilor Azeem supported it as a request for information. City Councilor Nolan clarified it seeks an opinion on future options. Solicitor Bear stated that while all provided information was given to the Council, research would be needed to determine if fraudulent action by an applicant could allow revocation, noting that a curb cut approval is a property right and due process would be required. Mayor Simmons expressed concern about the practicality and potential for prolonged debate, voting present.</li>
<li><strong>Outcome:</strong> Adopted by a roll call vote of 6-1-2 (6 Yes, 1 No, 2 Present).</li>

The order further calls for the MBTA to collaborate with the MWRA, DCR, DPH, the City of Cambridge, and the community to address this public health threat.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pulled by:</strong> City Councilor Patricia Nolan</li>
<li><strong>Main Sponsor:</strong> City Councilor Catherine Zusy</li>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong> City Councilor Nolan supported the intent but expressed concern about the specificity of the proposed solutions (e.g., "three acres of green stormwater infrastructure") without a broader understanding of the MBTA site. Commissioner Watkins explained the complexity of CSO control plans, the significant progress already made, and the ongoing collaborative process with MWRA and Somerville. She cautioned against prescriptive orders that might not align with comprehensive, effective solutions. City Councilor Zusy defended the specificity as a political document to advocate for green infrastructure and highlighted the timeliness given the MBTA's RFP timeline. Mayor Simmons exercised her Charter Right to move the item to next week's agenda to allow for further discussion and potential amendments.</li>
<li><strong>Outcome:</strong> Charter Right exercised, item moved to next week's agenda.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Charter Right 1: That the exception language in Chapter 2.129.040, Section J of the Cambridge Municipal Code be revised with language clarified that the Cambridge City employees shall not participate and federal immigration enforcement operations, and that the sole role of the Cambridge City employees during any action by ICE is only to protect public safety and not to assist or facilitate the work of ICE.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Exercised by:</strong> City Councilor Paul Toner</li>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong> City Councilor Toner raised concerns from the Cambridge Patrol Officers Association about potential confrontational situations if officers are required to monitor ICE and ask for identification. Solicitor Bear clarified federal regulations on ICE agent identification (they must state they are an ICE agent but not necessarily name/badge number). City Manager Huang acknowledged the concerns but emphasized the importance of the Welcoming City Ordinance and clarifying the role of local law enforcement. Vice Mayor McGovern and City Councilor Wilson requested to be added as co-sponsors, expressing strong support for strengthening the ordinance. City Councilor Zusy referenced a Boston Globe article on rights during ICE arrests. City Councilor Sobrinho-Wheeler argued the updates clarify police roles and the need to identify agents due to past abductions. City Councilor Siddiqui and City Councilor Nolan emphasized the importance of clarity and protecting residents. Mayor Simmons expressed strong support for the intent but concern about mechanisms that might put officers or residents in harm's way, voting present.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Exercised by:</strong> City Councilor Paul Toner</li>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong> City Councilor Toner opposed the opening, citing strong opposition from Wesley Avenue residents and the proximity of other access points. He noted the gate has been closed for 30 years due to past issues. City Councilor Nolan supported the opening, emphasizing community access, equity, and connectivity. Assistant City Manager O'Reilly confirmed the gate has been closed for approximately 30 years and that staff does not anticipate antisocial behavior. Commissioner McKenna highlighted the role of linear paths in re-knitting communities. City Councilor Sobrinho-Wheeler argued for consistency in providing connections, referencing other multi-family housing areas. City Councilor Zusy opposed, citing the quiet nature of Wesley Avenue, past negative experiences, and concerns about increased pavement and tree impact. Vice Mayor McGovern proposed an amendment to add an ordered clause for the City Manager to work with the Wesley Avenue community on safety improvements, including improved lighting and a lockable gate. City Councilor Wilson expressed concern about disregarding abutters' concerns and the potential for renewed antisocial behavior. Mayor Simmons stated she would not vote for the opening, citing the 30-year closure and the impact on residents.</li>
<li><strong>Outcome:</strong> Amended to include Vice Mayor McGovern's proposed ordered clause by a roll call vote of 9-0. Adopted as amended by a roll call vote of 5-4-0 (5 Yes, 4 No, 0 Present).</li>
