<p><strong>1. Call to Order</strong></p>

<li>Meeting called to order at 6:06 PM by Chair Councilor Large.</li>
<li>Roll call confirmed a quorum.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Approval of Minutes of March 4, 2025</strong></p>

<p><strong>3. Order 250133: Update on Condominium Conversion and Tenant Protection Laws</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Director Alan Shatter provided an update on changes to condominium conversion and tenant protection laws resulting from the 2024 Housing Bond Bill.</li>
<li><strong>Key Discussion Points:</strong><ul>
<li>The 2024 Housing Bond Bill granted cities and towns the authority to regulate condominium conversions for buildings with two or more units.</li>
<li>Somerville already had this authority since the 1980s due to its own legislation, which regulates all two- and three-family buildings, regardless of owner occupancy.</li>
<li>The state law now allows regulation of two- and three-family buildings that are not owner-occupied. Somerville's legislation is broader.</li>
<li>The state law change is estimated to regulate an additional 287,200 units statewide.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Young Campan Question:</strong><ul>
<li>Inquired about the possibility of giving Somerville residents preference in purchasing units during condo conversions to prevent corporate acquisitions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Director Shatter Response:</strong><ul>
<li>Tenants already have the right of first purchase during condominium conversions.</li>
<li>Giving an owner something in exchange, such as a variance or inclusionary zoning, could allow for stronger tenant protections.</li>
<li>Somerville has a residency preference for inclusionary programs and 100 Homes programs based on data showing no disadvantage to marginalized communities.</li>
<li>Random residency preferences in the general housing market may violate fair housing laws.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>No action taken. Item closed.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Order 250134: Update on Eviction Sealing Assistance</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Director Alan Shatter provided an update on efforts to raise awareness for eviction sealing assistance in light of recent state legislation.</li>
<li><strong>Key Discussion Points:</strong><ul>
<li>The Affordable Homes Act allows tenants to petition the court to seal eviction records under certain circumstances.</li>
<li>Eviction record sealing is important because landlords and screening companies often use eviction databases for tenant selection.</li>
<li><strong>Conditions for Sealing Eviction Records:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>No-fault evictions:</strong> Records can be sealed.</li>
<li><strong>Dismissed cases:</strong> Records can be sealed.</li>
<li><strong>Tenant won their case:</strong> Records can be sealed.</li>
<li><strong>Non-payment evictions:</strong> Records can be sealed immediately if the full judgment amount is paid. If not paid, records can be sealed after four years if the tenant demonstrates financial hardship and there has been no other eviction action.</li>
<li><strong>False evictions:</strong> Records can be sealed after seven years if there has been no intervening eviction.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Somerville and Cambridge collaborated on a regional response, conducting six workshops.</li>
<li>The Office of Housing Stability sent over 100 letters to clients who may be eligible for sealing.</li>
<li>17 petitions were filed in Somerville workshops; 4 have been sealed, and others are pending.</li>
<li>Information has been disseminated through email lists, newsletters, and social media.</li>
<li>The Housing Stability Notification Act documents are being revised to include eviction record sealing information.</li>
<li>Staff is trained to assist individuals with sealing their eviction records.</li>
<li>The trial court has created an easy walk-through system for pro-se petitioners.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Councilor Young Campan:</strong> Thanked the director and everyone who has been working to get the word out about this.</li>
<li>No action taken. Item closed.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. Order 250247: Report on Economic Impact of Federal Immigration Policy Changes on Somerville Businesses</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Deputy Director of Economic Development provided a report on the economic impact of federal immigration policy changes on Somerville businesses.</li>
<li><strong>Key Discussion Points:</strong><ul>
<li>The Economic Development Division does not directly track economic data on businesses but relies on SummerStat for support.</li>
<li>Local sales tax data can indicate trends in sales.</li>
<li>Anecdotally, business owners have expressed strong concerns for the life, health, and safety of their workers.</li>
<li>The division provides information and access to resources in collaboration with other departments.</li>

<li>Director Alan Nassio and Miranda Rubin presented the annual action plan for HUD entitlement programs.</li>
<li><strong>Key Discussion Points:</strong><ul>
<li>The city is not required to have the grant accepted, but it must file an annual plan.</li>
<li>All three programs were relatively level-funded this year.<ul>
<li>CDBG: \$2,477,825</li>
<li>HOME: \$517,544</li>
<li>ESG: \$218,817</li>

<li>Inquired about notable changes from the FY25 plan, considering the end of ARPA funds.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Director Nassio Response:</strong><ul>
<li>The city will be leveraging the full financing capabilities of the CDBG program for the first time in 20 years.</li>
<li>The city will be doing a Section 108 borrowing of approximately \$10 million for phase two of the Clarence and Hill project.</li>
<li>This will cost the city approximately \$500,000 in annual entitlement payments.</li>
</ul>
</li>
