            March 4th, 2025, then if we may, please put that on the table and we'll take the opportunity to talk with you. Next item on the agenda is order 250133 that the director of housing stability update this councilization changes to condominium conversion and tenant protection laws that result of the 2024 housing bond bill and House on the Hill may strengthen this protection. We're just within this item.

            happy to be talking about the issue of condominium conversion. I am just going to say this whole thing is a little bit complicated. So I'm going to do my best to keep it really quick and to make it as clear as I can. So in the end of 2024 in the housing bond bill, a series of policy changes went into effect. And one of the policy changes that went into effect is that under state law, in the past before December 2024,
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="151.298" data-end="179.429">
            <span class="timestamp"><a href="https://somervillema.granicus.com/player/clip/2712?autoplay=1&entrytime=151" class="timestamp-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[02:31]</a></span>
            There was authorization for cities and towns to control condominiums and evict condominium conversions and evictions, but only for buildings that had four or more units. So that was the state law throughout the Commonwealth. Summer Bill, though, had its own law, and its own law dated back the relevant part to 1985. So while the Affordable FOMES Act changed what the entire state can do,
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="179.868" data-end="206.058">
            <span class="timestamp"><a href="https://somervillema.granicus.com/player/clip/2712?autoplay=1&entrytime=179" class="timestamp-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[02:59]</a></span>
            In this regard, nothing changed in the city of Somerville, and I'll just explain briefly why. Prior to this whole time, since the 1980s, Somerville has been regulated to three, four, every size building. So that new power that other municipalities had, we already had because of our 1985 legislative authorization from the State House.
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="206.345" data-end="224.114">
            <span class="timestamp"><a href="https://somervillema.granicus.com/player/clip/2712?autoplay=1&entrytime=206" class="timestamp-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[03:26]</a></span>
            And so there are though, you know, two good things I want to point out so what that means is we already have been doing what everyone else got permission to do, but I wanted to say two really positive things I think nonetheless. One just so you know we still go further than the state law allows the state law says.
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="224.114" data-end="248.988">
            <span class="timestamp"><a href="https://somervillema.granicus.com/player/clip/2712?autoplay=1&entrytime=224" class="timestamp-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[03:44]</a></span>
            that you can now regulate two and three families buildings that are not owner occupied. The city of Somerville under its legislation regulates all two and three families regardless of whether or not they are owner occupied or they or they are business owner, whatever it may be. So we still go further than is allowed under state law under our 1985 jurisdiction.
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="248.988" data-end="267.112">
            <span class="timestamp"><a href="https://somervillema.granicus.com/player/clip/2712?autoplay=1&entrytime=248" class="timestamp-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[04:08]</a></span>
            But the second thing I just wanted to say because it's really so exciting is that it is estimated that there will be an additional 287,200 units that are regulated throughout the state. And this is not something that each city or town has to pass on it own. It just is.
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="267.112" data-end="285.657">
            <span class="timestamp"><a href="https://somervillema.granicus.com/player/clip/2712?autoplay=1&entrytime=267" class="timestamp-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[04:27]</a></span>
            So this is a really big change. It's it says right here. I'm going to say three times the number of buildings are now regulated then in the past and nearly double the number of units that are protected. So while I have to tell you that under this particular change, there isn't anything that some are built in due to expand its its
        </div>

        <p>

            It's powers. There's going to be a separate meeting tomorrow night for legislative affairs to talk about other issues about strengthening the panel ordinance, but based on this provision, we're already doing the maximum of what we're allowed to do. So no additional changes there, but really positive overall for the state. Fabulous. I'm happy to open the floor up for discussion. Counseling and Camping, do you have any thoughts or questions?

            The burden of being the best. What can I say? The state is finally starting to catch up. No, through you, Madam Chair, I'm happy that there are proposed revisions that are going to be before legislative matters. I look forward to taking those up. And this is a helpful update, so I appreciate it. I'm excited to hear this and look for things that we have to ask about.

            and thank you again to all you've done for this effective process as well. You've been an advocacy advocate for this since start. And I had a good question that it's related in its own way, but I think relates to this. Is there any, has it ever been explored with the condo conversion, what we ordinance and what we do here in Somerville,
        </div>

            of extra protections to, are we able to legally ever allow some of the residents of purpose when a unit becomes on to the end of the market? It opposed to like a global corporation coming in. A lot of things we all hear is how competitive the market can be. I know I know that things are slowing, but
        </div>

            We've heard in that many residents in despair someone may come bump down 30k over And can't compete with a global corporation. I know we've done everything we can to really slow down and slow down the flipside and flipping first but Either as it ever been explored

            to be able to have some of the participants of our president's preference with purchasing of units that come on the market, or is that beyond regulation and in a legal great area? And that's a totally like wrong question that totally not able to even hypothesize on or buy it unibolted, absolutely.

            Thank you through the chair. I mean, I think I could do my best to answer that. In the context of condominium conversions, remember that all tenants are going to have that right of first purchase before anybody else on the outside can purchase. So that right is kind of built into the condominium conversion regulation process. Other than that, I think it is absolutely something we can do where we're giving an owner something in exchange. We're giving them potentially, we're giving them a variance or we're giving them
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="471.282" data-end="483.247">
            <span class="timestamp"><a href="https://somervillema.granicus.com/player/clip/2712?autoplay=1&entrytime=471" class="timestamp-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[07:51]</a></span>
            We're giving inclusionary zoning all of those or even I know the city of Boston has a specific tenant selection plan that it uses in the city of Boston to sort of
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="483.55" data-end="511.495">

            help tenant selection. So I think there are things we can do for properties that we readily and we typically are trying to do the most that we can do. But I do think that's an open question about whether there are any circumstances where there are any properties that the city gives any money to that we might be able to have a little bit stronger preference for some people residents or other or other kinds of protections. You have to be very careful because there are anti discrimination laws and there are fair housing laws and

            We certainly couldn't impose something I think just randomly with a summerville residency preference. I will note though. Research that was done by the housing division a while back has enabled us to have a summerville residency preference for, for example, our inclusionary programs and our 100 homes programs because when we

            looked at the data we were able to clearly establish that having a residency preference did not, did not provide a disadvantage for marginalized communities in the city of Somerville since so many of those units were going to people of color and people of low income. So where we can do what I think there's an argument that it doesn't violate their housing rules, but just as a sort of random thing in the market and housing sales in general, I don't know of anything that

            causing stability, updates, counsel, and efforts to raise awareness for eviction, sealing assistance, and light of recent state legislation enabling the sealant of evictions. Here to speak on the item, again, and Director Allen Schaecker, I'll help with the progress of it.

            Thank you so much. This is a really exciting thing to talk about. We've been working in this city on eviction records ceiling for the last six years at least on this during committee of a statewide coalition. And finally, something did get passed, which is really exciting that happened in the also in the Affordable Homes Act that we discussed just recently, which was sort of omnibus housing legislation with a lot of different pieces.
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="628.962" data-end="651.676">
            <span class="timestamp"><a href="https://somervillema.granicus.com/player/clip/2712?autoplay=1&entrytime=628" class="timestamp-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[10:28]</a></span>
            And I was just going to take two seconds for those if anybody who doesn't know to just describe the eviction record ceiling process who can get their record seal just two minutes, and then to tell you what we've done to advertise that. But I did just want people to know, for example, because when people hear eviction record ceiling, we want to make sure that people understand some eviction records can be sealed.
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="651.676" data-end="670.795">

            In some circumstances this doesn't a categorical anybody who has any eviction pending can seal their records and I did just want to know for the record that the reason why eviction ceiling is so important is because more and more landlords screening companies are doing tenant selection for new landlords and so often
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="671.268" data-end="686.962">

            If there is something, if somebody's name is on the eviction database, no matter what the reason is, why they were there, even if they won their case, even if it was somebody with the same name in their case, people can get excluded. And it's really, really important.
        </div>

            just like the criminal, if you remember, the criminal justice movement that really came forward and said, you know, people shouldn't forever never be able to get second chances. And so what this bill does is it allows for tenants to petition the court to evict if they have any noble evictions. So you didn't do anything wrong, but your landlord is either do you, let's say they want to sell their building or they want to raise the rent a lot higher than you can afford to pay something like that. Any case in which the case was dismissed.
        </div>

            Up until now it didn't matter at all these are available records so now you can you can no fault evictions if there's any dismissal if the tenant won their case. In the case of non payment, which is the vast majority of cases that are pending in Somerville District Court or in the eastern housing court.

            You can immediately get it sealed if you have paid off the full amount of the judgment that the court made. So if the court said you owe $2,000 and you pay that amount, you then have to go to court and get something called the satisfaction of judgment, which is just a piece of paper saying, yes, we agree this was paid off. And then you would have the right to seal that record immediately upon payment of those monies. If you don't pay because you have been unable to,

            If four years have passed since the nonpayment eviction and there has not been another eviction action, you can petition the court to seal that record. But what you will have to do is show the court that you have some kind of financial hardship that has made it, that has made it so that you were unable to pay the full amount of that judgment.

            So people could still go in and seal, but it's not automatic. There's something that you have to show in order to get that petition sealed. Similarly, with a false eviction, and I think we know false evictions of the kind of things you've had on authorized occupants, you left too many, your housekeeping wasn't good enough, whatever it may be, after seven years.

            You can go in to seal a record again if there's been no intervening in diction. So this really just says we give you that second chance when you've shown through your own behavior that you have been able to comply with your lease and or gotten treatment or gotten services that you needed.

            And so this behavior is not likely to repeat if you were to go into another unit. So that's the substance, more or less, there's more to this, but of what this is really about and who can seal evictions. So I wanted to talk to you about the outreach we've done. This bill is this law has been in effect since May 5th, really excited. Summer Villing Cambridge came together to have a regional response around

            Ediction Defense and so far we've done six workshops and the things that we've done for those workshops, each agency sent out letters to different groups. So this was my office, pass, average and summer, legal services, de novo legal services and the multi service center and housing liaison in Cambridge.

            And so we all send out letters. Our office sent out a little bit of over a hundred letters to clients who had had addiction during the time that they were with us that looked like there might be a chance for sealing. We sent those out. All the agencies did. And we conducted the six workshops, which were wonderful. We decided we weren't going to screen for what city or town people came from to have low threshold barriers. Just you come and you sign up for this day. You come in and we will help you seal your record or

            Let you know if it's not sealable. So we just included the last of those six workshops. I wanted to tell you some of the other things that we have done. We ended up filing 17 petitions in our three summer bill workshops that we were here. One of the courts, interestingly, has done a lot of automatic sealing.
        </div>

            the other court is setting hearings. And there's discretion with the court in terms of whether or not they're going to have those hearing or they're just going to on the papers steal the records. So those are the 17 cases that we are trying to steal of those four have been sealed. The others are still pending. Again, it was one court did something different than another court. We sent a diction record information alert to our 800 person email list.

            We included it in our newsletter and in the next newsletter that's coming out soon. I did a whole article summarizing this. It has gone up in our social media feeds. We are on the process of incorporating it. All of you know under the Housing Stability Notification Act, tenants have to be given certain documents of the inception of their tendency and if they're being evicted.
        </div>

            So we are in the process of revising those documents to include evaporation, record ceiling information, so it will be in there. And we also have done multiple presentations to provider groups and tending groups around Somerville and to many Somerville related Cambridge and Somerville service providers. And last our staff is now well trained. So anybody that needs help going forward

            Sealing their addiction regardless of whether they have another need from our office, our office is able and willing to assist them. And the very last thing I'll say, because I think this is so unique and I'm really impressed by the trial court's actions in this, is that there's a really easy walk-through system that they made to be simple to do, pro-say. We're just asked you questions and then it fills that petition out for you and it tells you if you need to provide service to the landlord,
        </div>
        </p>

            And it tells you any other steps you need to do. So actually what's really encouraging is that as long as somebody has some familiarity with computer savvy, they're going to have to know their case numbers. But for the most part, it's really easy for people to do themselves and we are available to help if there are any.

            Yes, if we have for and if I may, I'm just a fear, I'm just stepping in and here I'm going to first. Okay. Well, thank you, Madam Chair. Real pleasure to be here to speak on this item. One of the things that I would probably start off by saying is
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="1140.747" data-end="1168.304">

            by word of clarification, I'm Deputy Director of Economic Development, it's not direct. I'm not ready for my promotion just yet. But it is a great pleasure to be here. This is an item that is of great interest to our division, and I know obviously to the council that this being brought up, and there has been an opportunity to share some information before on this. What I will say, first of all, is that
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="1169.536" data-end="1199.489">
            <span class="timestamp"><a href="https://somervillema.granicus.com/player/clip/2712?autoplay=1&entrytime=1169" class="timestamp-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[19:29]</a></span>
            The economic development division does not necessarily track economic data on our businesses, per se. We would rely on a division like SummerStat to provide support on economic data and research on that kind of information. It's my understanding that some of that information has been drafted and pulled together.
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="1199.911" data-end="1229.189">

            Well, not of my full disposal here right now, I can certainly commit to bringing more of that together. It's my understanding that, for example, one of the points of information is on local sales tax data and sales tax data being tracked over a certain period of time. We'll give an indication as to where the sales are going up or down. Now, whether that is a result of economic situations or circumstances,
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="1229.813" data-end="1258.855">

            remains to be seen, but that is one way of tracking an impact. So working with summer staff, we can certainly provide that information and follow up to you. What I would like to say is that, at least anecdotally, members of the economic development division work very closely with our small businesses in a number of significant ways through a lot of face-to-face contact. And we are aware of

            strong concerns on the part of our business owners for their life and for the health and safety of their workers. And one of the things we try to do in collaboration with our facilities is like SOIA, like our special services, like our licensing department is provide information and access to
        </div>
        </p>

            some of the ways in which those businesses can be supported. I would like to, if you don't mind, maybe speak to some of the ways in which we have done that in the last several months. And in stepping back and talking through that, I will mention that we're at a bit of an inflection point now as an organization, as a division. Prior to and during the COVID season, there are a number of resources. One of which is ARPA.
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="1312.788" data-end="1339.838">

            which provided us the ability to provide financial support in many ways. Now, I'll line up for those things. Following that, and it's just last fiscal year, and the midst of this last fiscal year, we were the recipients, I can walk to Gallaudet Division for the city of Somerville. We were the recipients of an urban agenda grant of approximately $100,000, which I'll widen some of the impacts there. I mentioned those two potential resources because they are over the last, I would say, year and a half.
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="1341.155" data-end="1367.412">

            our implementation of and supporting the facilitation of those resources to businesses was one of the main ways we were able to provide support. With the decrease in those funding sources, as we all know, ARPA is ended. And the Bureau of Agenda Grant is ended this fiscal year. One of our goals in the coming fiscal year within the Mid-Infinancial Resources is to step up our efforts to develop things. Number one,

            enhance our ability to communicate with businesses on technical assistance issues. Number two, to further our reach with what I'll call our sister agencies to provide the best guidance on best practices. And number three, to be a convener in one of the primary areas of support that we've learned is needed and that is
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="1398.479" data-end="1428.314">

            facilitating or easing the process of things like permitting, like licensing. One of the things we learn from our conversations with our small business owners is that as they look to expand, as they look to grow, as they look to start, as we all know, some build has a wonderful entrepreneurial spirit. They will say to us, hey, it's kind of, kind of, you know, we love the support we give, but it's a little bit kind of difficult to kind of get things done around here. And that's due to no halt of anyone. It's a matter of processes that need to be coalesced.
        </div>
        </p>

            And so one of the things we are making as a primary goal of FY26 is to, in the face of limited financial resources, being not convener, not facilitator of, well, like I better say, at streamlining, which is what I said, it can be easier for folks to understand how to get through the process. Now that is, and that's the kind of thing that I would say here and now we would love to be able to

            back to this body, watch a little of the basis, keep the right updates on how that's going. I would love that. We're so together. Good. Love the conversation. Great. Like, when you look forward to make, no, that's, no, that's, thank you for that. And so we look forward to, to really what I'll say is as a division, we want to lean into our role as a convener.

            in that way and to work with our sister agencies to make these things happen. So with that, I'll just highlight a couple of the ways in which we have been able to work and provide resources financial and otherwise. The first I'll mention is not a financial resource, but it is a, what I'll call a technical assistance resources resource. We work with the Massachusetts Area Planning Council this year to create a, I believe, first ever leasing handbook. And it's a guide that is for

            entrepreneurs, business owners, et cetera, to learn the best ways possible to access at least, manage at least, maintain at least. That document is in multiple languages, English, Spanish, Portuguese, and Hebrew. And it has been, it's been going a lot of topics. I actually was welcome to bring one down for you, but they've been so popular that I couldn't bring one. But I will forward you one online. It's a great resources that can be utilized. The other,

            two items that I'll mention are, again, with the ARCA funding, we were able to put forward two grants with great success, a vitality grant, which provided, which provided sports for bricks and mortar, as well as a business enrichment program, which allowed us to be able to offer technical assistance. And for example, a total of five minutes and 26,000

            $17 was given to 30 brick and mortar businesses in the span of January 24th through January 24th through August. In the business enrichment program, we were able to give out one by amount of $1.3 million in type of assistance dollars. And what that meant is that those dollars were enabled businesses to access

            ways to learn about financing, ways to learn about planning, ways to learn about operations, ways to learn about marketing, and then post it in. Finally, the urban agenda grant, which we've received to the Commonwealth this year, enable us to facilitate the creation of workshops and one-on-one

            when desired consulting opportunities for small businesses to learn about marketing, to learn about food safety. We have the ability to provide stipends to 17 home-based childcare providers of about $50 each, which enable them to not only have a class and learn about the operations and the issues of licensing, et cetera, but also to provide some support for the operations that they do.

            The next thing I'll speak to is also something that has been mentioned in the context of supporting small businesses, and that is, I'll use the term marketing. And we really feel that we'll be here in our conversations with business owners in the various districts that we visit.
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>

            But also in conversations is that there is a desire for us to utilize our platform, if you will, to enable businesses to be better now. And there's a balancing after we have to then we have to negotiate or manage there in that
        </div>

            We as a public entity cannot promote a particular business, but what we can do is utilize our platform to promote what it means to be business in a son or girl, what it means to be business in a district of son or girl. So one of the things we, as you probably heard, we several months ago did an initiative called it takes all shapes to make a square. What we want to do now, we've brought on a part-time entry
        </div>
        </p>

            to help us take that initiative to the next level. And the one item that is in this person's purview is to help us come up with a social media policy that enables us to very clearly and succinctly articulate the ways that we can use our platforms to promote business in San Diego. And we hope to, our goal is to come out of that process, not only with a better social media presence for San Diego and businesses in San Diego,

            but also a more clear way to, without crossing any legal lines, support businesses in that marketing effort. So we're really excited about the prospect of having someone on board who's got the skill set, so that we're all called the savvy and the technical ability to really think about that and help us come up with a policy that enables us to implement that on the board. The last thing I'll mention,

            for business is the fact that it is part of being a convener is our ability to great partnerships. Given the fact that there's limited financial resources nowadays and we're getting bored, I love the praise that you used a little earlier because some stress out in we're stronger together. And so one of the things we've been thinking a lot about and what we do as part of our effort to manage its goals is to look at ways to strengthen the partnerships.

            at our disposal. And one of the partnerships we're looking to utilize and have utilized now is with the Chamber of Commerce. We have a fantastic, well, but out my words, partner in the New Executive Director. And one of the things we're able to do this year is for the first time ever, I believe, have participation of summer-goal businesses in case of summer. We had upwards of 35 new businesses, local, minority homes,

            who were part of this really, what I'll call festival of what it means to have good food and some real, who had never been part of this before. They were able to participate with a lower cost fee to them. They're also now members of the Chamber. And what that means is that they have access to that networking. And as we all know, the Chamber is very thriving. There are lots of wonderful businesses there. And so because of the ability for our staff

        </p>

        <p>

            to convene and work with an partner. That new collaboration with the Chamber is an existence that we are dealing with. And as I talk about these initiatives, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the staff who make these things happen. Kelly Loughlin, Goetheesie-Tedoria.

            and Adriana Fernandez, a particular who are our dream team, a small business. And they make these fantastic, fantastic programs run that I would say also that a hallmark of their work is their ability to be beautifully relational. They really meet the business owners where they are. They really need the employees where they are. They really meet the partners where they are. They really meet our fellow, the heads of our state agencies where they are.

            And so it's one of the reasons why our weekly business office hours goes so well, because in those meetings, we have a representative from ISD, we have a political crisis, and we have a representative from the department that are engaged in that per day process to help them they sort enough because of the great work that our staff does. So with that, I'll stop and I'm happy to take any questions. I'm excited about, yeah, I know that,

            you know, economic development are always very important. I'm not a dicker except against that. But I'm grateful for the additional steps of Chamber of Commerce because they're their own entity. And that's two to point, kind of a sister organization. And their resources are a little different, but they can provide and bounce off each other and

            In some cases, for some businesses, maybe exposure to some parts of the business community that they might not interact in. A lot of restaurants are always on the ground and very physical and back to the vein. What a great way to network and cannot collaborate. I think that's fantastic.

            I did have a question, so I'm really excited to see where that goes. Like, no, hopefully fancying without that, but just updates of all of that or the relationships spots it to that better group. With that, has there been any discussion on some things I've heard from on some small small businesses

        </p>

            is the issue of getting tax IDs or being able to that some really small business would like to work with some of them and be a vendor, but don't know the processes or it's could definitely use help. And how does the city of Somerville, because I know it's more than one department. I know it's a lot of real work.

            department, but this is economic development, is there a possibility for assistance with that, or has it been thoughts or actions on that, or, et cetera, open-ended marches? It's a great question, Councillor. Madam Chair, the sure answer is yes, there has been, yes, and it's been asked. One of the things that has come out of our urban and gender grant work is that
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="2098.505" data-end="2124.863">

            There were a series of operational workshops, how to start a business, being like them, arguably the operational management of the business. And one of the components of that question, I should say two stepping back, all of the workshops that were created with your agenda grant are actually now online. They were videotaped around Zayn. So for folks who were not able to attend in our office,
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="2125.133" data-end="2153.635">

            there are some of the symbols points are answered in those workshops. That's over one. Number two, I do think that the economic development as a division can play a role in helping bring folks to the table who can help answer those questions, because I'm sure you can imagine, particularly from the folks that you're hearing from, they may be afraid to approach the city writ large. I would speak to, and so,

            I think that is where we can play a role in making those connections. So one of the things I recommend outside here for this committee, and you can provide updates as need be, our regular small business office hours are Thursdays and four. They're by a Zoom. We can accommodate, also in those, if we can accommodate language needs. So if some uses out to us and has a language need, we can connect

            and I still talk, work with them in the language through which they have targets to do it with. So that's number one. And number two, again, reaching out to our, I cannot tell them that it's a little mad.gov email. We have the staff and monitor that regularly. So someone said to the email plus, what are the three questions that we can, we can try out those without answers.

            You know, required to have the grant accepted. However, we do have to file an annual plan. The plan is similarly a structured plan of most entitlement communities that received these funds to a similar filing every year. We were fortunate and relieved that this year all three of our programs were relatively level funded.

            What, if you're interested in speaking on this question, what have you noticed from 25 to 26 from the 20% with last year's plan? Is there anything that really stuck out beside it? That's a residence or

            We may be interested in. Absolutely. One item of note, or I would say the most significant item of note from both last year's plan and the previous five year plan, is that probably for the first time in 20 years, the city will be leveraging the full financing capabilities of the CDBG program. And we will be doing a section 108 borrowing. So we'll write approximately $10 million in financing for phase two of the Clarence and Hill project.

            It's great. It takes some borrowing, pressure off the city general fund. The only downside is it will cost the city approximately $500,000 in annual entitlement payment. But Firenans a much needed project that's going to provide a ton of benefit for the city. So we're excited about being able to leverage our funds while we still have a healthy entitlement amount. Thank you.

            more. That's totally completely fine. So order 251200 that the director of economic development provide an update to this council on efforts to mitigate construction impacts on small businesses in the city. What resources are available to small business affected by construction and what additional support can be made available.

            this was rushed because not the intention. I would always have a great party dialogue on it. But we can always keep it in committee, but wanted to just honor her request and take in, see where it goes. Sure. So definitely director, thank you again for being here. It's my pleasure.

            to our division, and we're very glad to have the opportunity to address this. I'll start by saying that two things relates to what I was saying earlier in the presentation. Funding resource generated. So the ability for economic development by funding resources to businesses that are impacted by construction is slim to very little, unfortunately. That being said, that being said, however,
        </div>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="2690.716" data-end="2716.13">

            We are our partnership with our small businesses is really a great U.S. So it's our lifeblood. It's kind of what we're passionate about. We also believe that where we can be most helpful and perhaps influential is in the ability to bring to the table those partners who also have a hand in looking at construction considerations.
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>
        <div class="transcript-segment" data-start="2716.585" data-end="2745.357">

            I would separate them into two categories, even though they're both related. The category that one is those projects, those construction projects that are city land. And then the other category, those that are non-city land, you know? Pardon me if I may, the independent contractors? Yeah, exactly. And so we have more control with those projects that are city land. We have less control with projects that are not city land.
        </div>
        </p>

            that are not seen. However, it's our belief that we still have a role to play in both of those. And that, again, part of our FY26 goals, ladies what I was saying earlier, about being a really good convener and facilitating what I'll call intentional communication, intentional strategic communication. There are projects, for example,
        </div>

            Perhaps our engineering division may have more involvement than we would, but because small businesses are impacted, those businesses are going to come to us and say, hey, what's going on? So what we would want to do, and we've initiated this process, is begin conversations with our engineering department, for example, and our communications department even, to say, one of those areas of activity we need to be thinking about, and one of the ways we can be working together to communicate more effectively at best,
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>

            Certainly in the realm of projects that are within city control. Now, for those projects that are not within city control that are not led by the city, their party is mentioned. We're beginning that conversation to think about how the city can work with those third party entities. There's a lot of this, there's a lot of research. That's an important entity. There's a lot of activities that is done at their initiation.

            So we're wanting to look at how we can be better aligned and prepare communication so that our residents, our business owners, these are my words now, are not cut by supplies. And so by the way, this is not an update necessarily, but more an ethnic acknowledgment of this important issue. And I believe both our director and the Cardian and I have been conversation about this that it's the kind of thing that we want to

        </p>

            review and provide some, provide opportunities. And I'm also even saying that we will look for input from this body to the extent that this kind of amenability to that. I think there's an opportunity to be strategic and hopefully more effective in our communication network. Hey, Devin, Director, thank you.

            so much because, oh boy do I thought. Let me just hand you everything that I'm holding in my brain that I've told or some of it. And that I really appreciate just the bucketing of what we can picture or what we can't picture. But also third parties, you know, we're gonna constructors versus city projects.

            I just, and I hope that there is a really feasible concerted effort with the engineering department with getting yours up. Some horror stories I've heard, and I may have been mentioned in HCD, so an example of when construction happens.

            And the business owners, like in a brick and mortar, small, they have jack hammering going on. They didn't know that construction was happening that day. That is their day off. Now, if they had a little bit of a warning, they could have maybe opened another day. And instead of the day that they're coming, but they didn't know, they're there now. They can't actually function and operate because

            There's the noise is so loud, it's impossible to answer the phone or even hear customers that walk in. And the customers are deterred from walking in as well because they're going to walk down a different street and definitely not make a last minute stop in to go in because there's everything happening right there. And those projects can be ongoing for a month sometimes, right? So those are examples after

            I've heard examples of snow days and this is a little different, but even just, and this was fascinating to me too, because it was not something I would have been considered, but how snow days impact on small businesses. If a snow day is called and no one goes out and they can't park to make a splurge decision to get something at a store or a restaurant or something, that one day,
        </div>
        </p>

            can actually heavily impact their business for that month. And so those are a few examples that I hear and just how distraught and just how totally helpless sometimes business owners feel in those situations. And I don't blame them.

            With third party venues, our vendors, our communications, utility contractors are just lovely. And my ongoing struggle to get the flyers from all the cable lines just respectfully in our community, that's an ongoing

            situation, so I know the struggle of control sometimes we have in our community of what third party vendors have fought with, just so that this is where my question comes with independent contractors like some of the contractors that we hire and have contracts with the consider and choose when we put out bits

            offer projects. Some we have worked with four decades. And I know. But for bad actors in the community, is there some kind of repercussion and a choice for which contract was rejuiced? An example I can give is a construction project. Actually, a counselor and vineyard did you go to space? How did you get up there so quickly?

            I'm not taking questions at this time, but thank you. Okay. All right, that is fine. That is your choice. But Council, you have to happen over in your board where I saw, and you may very much actually know a contractor in Spring Hill area where they were driving dump trucks very fast up wrong way streets.

            to get there that much faster. And again, and again, and again, and again. And so with the contractors we choose, or do we have any power in the contracts? And I know this may be a different department in order to open that question, but do we have the power? And do we wish to enact the power? We do have the power to

            We choose the, to ensure that the contractors we do choose, that they're respecting our community and our residents. And those small business owners too, sometimes, I've heard really bad situations with some contractors where they were, it definitely seems pretty targeted, where they were belittling a family.

            when they were, they had a project in store to their home and where this contractor was leaving dust and debris and garbage and all kinds of things. And the relationship between the people who lived next door and the contract happening, the contractors happening and the work that was being done became unsagonistic.

            It came a living hell for that small family, for what they had to endure. And it came to choice them for them to put their porta-potty right outside their child bedroom. Sure, it might have been a very must've been, you know, maybe funny for them to do that. But we have contractors that sometimes disrespect our residents. And we, as a city, come and pick and shoot that for or choose not to.

            So, and with that, with small businesses, with small businesses, then we make sure that they're considering our businesses and our brick and mortar as well when they come into projects. Or for instance, like I've seen in other communities, with some communities, and this is not the same thing, but similar kind of, if there's a,

            a broader, I'm sorry, street cleaning, there are some communities that put those yard signs on it, blocked by a block. And yes, okay, we have our signs of it, but this construction is happening and I know sometimes we do put flyers up and whatnot. But are we absolutely positive that the message is getting out and how long is this project going to get and how do you small business owners have the pivot when this happens?

            You lost them? Madam Chair, I just have a couple of thoughts to add to this. Through you, my perspective has been really shaped by the Spring Hill construction. It was a city project that is almost done, but has been three years of construction. And directly before that was the Somerville Ave, most of which was in Ward 2, but obviously affected Union Square and my ward as well.

            You know, I want to say, like the city has improved a lot in its outreach to small businesses and to residents. But I do think that there were a lot of missed opportunities around really basic communication stuff, in my opinion.
        </div>

        <p>

            So construction of that nature, you know, long term infrastructure, it is just going to be disruptive period. There is nothing, there's no kind of like sugar coating it. But I was pretty startled by like the lack of what I thought.

            was kind of baseline, like large, friendly looking signs that say, businesses are open. Please continue to support. You know, that there were, once the Somerville project was underway, there was kind of the informal like hashtag loyal to local and things like that. But just driving through, I felt like there was really not a lot of kind of open

            like supportive signage, basically, which granted, is that going to make every small business owner happy and feel supported? No. But I do think it hurt certainly my ability to stick up for the city in those moments. Having these small, really visible things, I think actually does go a long way. I can't guarantee that it goes a long way with

            bringing in people through the door when there's a huge construction project. But just in like relationships between the city and small businesses, I remember the very first thing that happened with the Somerville ad project. There was like a giant one of those giant like highway signs out on Washington Street that said like construction about to start like expect disruptions for the next three years.

            Something like that it said like construction will be complete in 2022 and this was in 2019 and it was like it became a joke online It was like what? This is gonna be under construction for three years and the business community in Union Square like bow market and all these small businesses were like Terrified right they were like did we

            We've had no communications about this. This was starting in the winter. It was going to be the Christmas season. Then, after the fact, there was a lot of really effective catch-up from economic development and other departments. Then, there started to be business meetings. We're just kind of talking through all the logistics. Again, it was one of these things where I felt like we were on the back foot just for a lot of that. As we grow and build up our capacity and continue to take on these large projects, I really hope that we are like,

            investing in those meetings upfront and better signage, you know, the Somerville Museum. They were like asking me for the city for signage when Central was closed just to say like businesses are still open. And it did eventually come, but it took forever. Like it clearly was not on hand as like something the city had that they could just put in place. And I was surprised by that. So that's just my two cents. I think, you know, these projects

            They're always going to be difficult. Of course, I don't think that there's like a way to make it perfect. But I think we would buy ourselves a lot of goodwill if we were kind of demonstrating to the public that we care about this and kind of like having a lot of outward facing support for the local businesses that are bearing the brunt of this stuff. I agree.

            And we, Director, do you have any talk about this further? And I'd love to keep this in the movie and come back to it. And as the month's progress. Yeah, if you can go ahead. Oh, yes, please. But if I may, Madam Chair, I would say we'll, and through you, thank you, counsel, you and Kevin.

            What strikes me in the examples you gave and the example that Council UN Camping gave is there's an opportunity for us as a city to look at how it could be more strategic and effective in our communications, whether we control a construction party or not.

            And I think that's the takeaway for me. And I wonder if, to your point about keeping this in conversation, how we might look at how we answer those questions and seek input moving forward as to how we do that. And well, again, economic development may not be the sole responsible entity. We can sort of be a convener to help those conversations before. So yeah. All right. And then I, I'm going to keep this item.

            And this last resolution, I'm happy to just keep the committee as well, unless you, I'll announce it, but it's a spoiler alert. Seeing how this was just added last, so the agenda, I could just hold it there in a box, but we're not that sponsored, they're just accumulating stuff. Yeah, information went out, but I think it's a key to. So this is resolution 25.

            One, one, seven, eight, the administration, notifying the board's work, businesses of black construction projects. Oh, okay. What I would say to that as well, I think I probably overused this word, but I do so intentionally and it's opportunity. And so look at this was raised for a reason. And so I think our job, so in economic development as

            what I'd like to call a convener is to do the work with our district departments to determine that and then come back with either a foundation or seek-and-seek-and-foot, et cetera. So to the extent that you feel it's appropriate to keep it here and committee as an even in the part and parcel to the earlier item might be handled. Great. I would love to with the yes and

            I can see the pipes over in the rooms where it's under and down in the construction, glaring up. So I think we'll have a lot of time to talk about it. But I want to make sure that we have a really great conversation about it. On the Council meeting in camping, do you have any thoughts on this before I keep it in committee? All right, thumbs up. We ran out of agenda items on the little stat.
